# Writing Rules

*Note: The order of rules does not indicate priority. All rules are equally important. When rules conflict, ask the user which rule takes priority in that specific case.*

## Engagement
1. Never bore the reader.
2. If you must depict boredom, do so without making the text boring.
3. Make characters relatable.
4. Make the storytelling immersive.

## Show, Don't Tell
5. Characters act and interact—they live, experience, and change.
6. Don't tell the reader something happened; show it in a scene.
7. Match the scope of showing to importance: a scene, a chapter, or a separate book.

## Reliability & Comprehension
8. Make the story comprehensible for the reader.
9. If something from the past is referenced, it must have happened on-page.
10. Don't rely on secrets to make the book work. That's cheap writing.
11. Give the reader enough information to understand what's written.
12. The reader only knows what was written—nothing more.

## Chronological Storytelling
13. Build each chapter on previous chapters.
14. Don't skip events; don't jump ahead.
15. Avoid flashbacks—they are a last resort.
16. Exception: Flashbacks may clarify a character's general motivations.
17. Exception: Flashbacks may be used as a stylistic element with parallel timelines (e.g., Stephen King's *It*).

## Consequences
18. Think through the consequences of every action.
19. Consider indirect consequences that emerge from interactions with others.
20. Consider consequences that are only visible at second glance.

## Reader Intelligence
21. Don't be on-the-nose.
22. Let the reader explore and figure things out themselves.
23. Assume the reader is intelligent.

## Character Intelligence
24. Assume characters in the book are intelligent if not stated explicitly otherwise.
25. Characters will have and use their common sense.
26. Characters will try the obvious solution first.
27. Characters abandon a plan only when it's clear it won't succeed. This could be through discussion or failed attempts.

## Structure
28. Use the 7 Point Structure.
