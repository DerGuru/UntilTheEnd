# Chapter 34

He spent the next morning preparing.

I didn't know what for. He told me he wanted to explore the terrain — practical, mundane, the kind of task that required solitude and clear sightlines and the absence of a traveling companion who might accidentally rearrange the geography.

I didn't argue. The headache was bad enough that solitude sounded like medicine.

What he actually did — what his notes tell me, what I've reconstructed from the meticulous record he kept because recording was the only way he could live with what he was planning — was this:

He found a clearing. Open. Wide. About two hundred meters across — the same radius as the field, and the coincidence was not coincidental. He was thinking in terms of blast radius. He was thinking like someone who had watched reality break twice and was now preparing to break it a third time, on purpose, and wanted to make sure the breakage had room to happen.

No mountains nearby. He checked. Not checked casually — walked the perimeter, evaluated the terrain, confirmed that there was no large geological feature within range that might be edited out of existence by whatever I did when pushed past limits. The missing flank was still visible on the eastern horizon, the smooth absence where rock used to be, and he looked at it while he planned, and his notes say that looking at it made him hate the plan more and made him more certain it was necessary.

Few trees. The ones that were there were small — saplings, young growth, the kind of flexible wood that might survive a stress event or at least break cheaply. He was calculating acceptable losses. Acceptable losses. For a man who documented butterflies.

He put his notebook in a crevice. Between two boulders, wrapped in the waterproof case, wedged deep enough to survive whatever came. If it went wrong — and *wrong* was a category he'd elevated from unlikely to operational — the documentation would survive. Someone would find it. Someone would know.

Then he came back.

He came back with the casual stride of a man who had spent a morning walking and had nothing more significant to report than the quality of the terrain and the direction of the wind. He sat down. He boiled water.

"Wei would have liked this place," he said.

The sentence landed in my chest like a stone in water. Not on the surface — it went deep, past the rational layer, past the analytical reflex that would have processed it as a statement about a dead spirit beast and a mountain location. It went to the place where Wei lived — the warm, curled-up place where her memory existed as feeling rather than information.

I flinched. Briefly. The flinch was involuntary — a contraction in the muscles of my torso, a tightening around the specific pain that Wei's name always created, the bruise that never healed because healing it would mean accepting it and accepting it would mean something I wasn't ready for.

The pain was sharp. Clear. Present.

And then — thirty seconds later — I couldn't remember what he'd said.

The sentence was gone. The specific words, the specific syntax, the casual delivery — erased. Cleaned. The wall had done its work, the guardian had intervened, the self-protection mechanism had identified the content as dangerous and removed it with the surgical precision that I'd learned to recognize and couldn't learn to prevent.

But the pain was still there.

I rubbed my chest. The gesture was unconscious — hand moving to the site of impact, pressing, as if pressure could locate the source. The pain had no address. The pain existed without its cause, an effect divorced from its origin, an echo without a sound.

"Something wrong?" Xu Ran asked.

I looked at him. He was watching me with the attentive stillness of a naturalist observing a phenomenon — not coldly, not without empathy, but with the specific focus of someone who needed to see this, needed to confirm this, needed to know that his theory was correct before he committed to the consequences.

"I don't know," I said. "Something — I feel —"

Couldn't finish the sentence. What did I feel? Pain. Where? Chest. Why? No idea. Literally no idea. The cause had been removed and the effect remained and the disconnection between them was maddening, the kind of maddening that made me want to press my temples and breathe and push against the wall and—

"You created the field," Xu Ran said. Flat. Direct. Not a question.

Fear. Immediate, visceral, spiking through my body like ice water. Fear of — what? The words registered and were processed and were gone, taken, erased, the guardian moving faster now, faster than before, as if it recognized the pattern and was accelerating its response.

But the fear stayed.

I couldn't tell what he'd said. Couldn't retrieve the sentence, couldn't reconstruct it, couldn't even remember that he'd spoken. But I was afraid. Suddenly, completely, groundlessly — the specific fear of a person who knows something terrible is true and can't remember what the terrible thing is.

"I—" My hands were shaking. "Why am I afraid?"

Xu Ran's face. I would learn, later, how much it cost him to sit there and watch this. To watch me feel things I couldn't understand, to watch the disconnection between cause and effect play out in real time on a person he chose to walk beside. His notes from this day are the shortest he ever wrote. Not from lack of observation — from the inability to translate what he was observing into clinical language.

"The mountain," he said. "Turn around."

I turned.

East. The horizon. The mountain with the missing flank — the smooth absence, the flowers at the edge, the geometry of nothing where something had been.

My body reacted before my mind could process. I was on my feet — when had I stood? — and my hands were clenched and the ground beneath me was vibrating with the subsonic rumble of emotion becoming physics. I was staring at the absent mountain and I didn't know WHY I was staring at it but my body knew, my gut knew, something deep in the architecture of my response system knew that the missing mountain was connected to me in a way that—

The thought dissolved. The knowledge evaporated. The cause was taken.

The feeling remained.

Not fear, this time. Something else. Something heavier, older, denser. Guilt. Responsibility. The weight of having done something that cannot be undone, pressing down on the inside of my chest like a hand.

I sat down. Slowly. The vibration stopped. The world settled.

Xu Ran sat beside me. Not close — the careful meters, the safety distance that had become their default spacing. He was breathing too carefully, the controlled respiration of a man who was running a very specific experiment on a very specific subject and was horrified by his own methodology.

"Three for three," he said. Quiet. To himself.

"What?"

"Nothing." He looked at the ground. At his hands. At the ground again. "I think I understand now. How the forgetting works."

"Tell me."

"I can't. You'll forget the explanation."

The absurdity of it should have been funny. The circular trap — knowing that knowing was useless because knowing would be taken — should have produced humor, the dark, exhausted humor that I'd been running on since the first time I'd realized my own mind was editing itself.

But it wasn't funny. It was the most terrifying thing he'd said since *are you afraid of me.*

"Then what?"

He looked at the mountain. At the absence. At the evidence of what I could do when I felt things strongly enough.

"Then I have to make you feel something so deeply that the feeling alone is enough. Without the content. Without the explanation. Without the words." He paused. "I have to reach the part of you that the forgetting can't touch."

I should have heard the warning in that. Should have recognized the specific timbre of a man who was describing a plan he despised, who was outlining an act of necessary cruelty with the detachment of someone who had already committed to committing it.

I didn't hear it. I heard a man with a plan. And plans were the one thing I didn't have.

"When?" I asked.

"Tomorrow."

He stood. Walked to the fire. Cooked dinner. His hands were steady because he willed them steady, and the effort of willing them was visible in the set of his jaw and the hardness of his shoulders and the way he didn't look at me for the rest of the evening.

I ate. I slept. The headache pulsed.

Tomorrow came.
