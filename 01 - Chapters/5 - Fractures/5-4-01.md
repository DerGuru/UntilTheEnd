# Chapter 20

Everything was there.

Xu Ran had spread it across the flat ground beside our fire like a surgeon laying out instruments before an operation. His copies of the scroll passages, arranged chronologically. His anomaly map with its tightening spiral. The qi signature comparisons — his own notation, meticulous, cross-referenced. The correlation charts. The timeline of the seven researchers and their identical endings. All of it laid out on packed earth in the firelight, organized with the precision of someone who understands that presentation is itself an argument.

He'd been working on this. Not just recording — synthesizing. While I'd been walking, pushing, probing ruins, he'd been building a picture from the data I generated and the observations I shared and the silences I left, which he'd learned to read as carefully as the words.

I stared into the fire.

He pushed a bowl of rice toward me. I took it. Ate. Mechanically, steadily, without pleasure or resistance — the eating of someone who has accepted food as fuel rather than experience. Progress from the woman who'd had to be tricked into swallowing soup eight months ago. Xu Ran noted this. I saw him note it. Neither of us commented.

The fire painted shadows on his arranged evidence. The scroll copies fluttered slightly in the night air, their edges curling, the ink catching the light in amber tones that made three-thousand-year-old words look warm.

"I can feel it," I said.

He looked up from the map he'd been adjusting.

"The answer. It's here. In all of this." I gestured at the spread. "The data is sufficient. The pattern is clear. I know what it points to. I just can't —" I stopped. Closed my eyes. The sensation was maddening — like a word on the tip of your tongue multiplied by a thousand, a meaning that sat just below the surface of thought, visible through the water but unreachable, as if reaching for it was what made it retreat.

"I know," he said quietly. "That's why I did this."

He stood. Lifted a stick. And began to draw.
