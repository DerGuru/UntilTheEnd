# Chapter 18

Three of them came on the fourth day after the qi storm.

They arrived at our camp with the precise choreography of people who have been told where to find someone and how to approach without provoking. Two men, one woman. Cultivator robes in a grey that was almost but not quite white — the color of neutrality, the diplomatic uniform. Mid-tier cultivation, maybe a little higher. Enough to be taken seriously. Not enough to be a threat.

To me, at least.

Their talismans gave them away before they spoke. Small discs of polished jade hanging from their belts — three each, evenly spaced, catching the firelight with a subtle iridescence that had nothing to do with the jade and everything to do with the qi they'd been tuned to harvest. Resonance Talismans. The Pencil's calling cards.

"We come on behalf of our master," the woman said. She was the speaker — the other two flanked her in positions that said *we are here to be seen, not heard.* "We seek conversation, not conflict."

She was good. The voice was calibrated: respectful without being submissive, formal without being stiff, warm without being false. The voice of someone who has been trained to communicate trust without earning it.

I said nothing.

Xu Ran, who had been writing in his notebook by the fire, set his pen down. He didn't close the notebook. That was deliberate — he wanted them to see that he was recording. A scholar's power move: *whatever you say is being documented.*

"Your master," he said. "Would that be Lian Zhuo?"

The name landed differently on each of the three. The woman's expression didn't change — professionals don't flinch at their employer's name. The man on the left shifted his weight half an inch leftward. The man on the right touched his talisman.

"You know the name," the woman said.

"The academic who fused the factions," Xu Ran said. "We've heard."

"Then you know he is a scholar. Like yourself." She nodded at the notebook. "He seeks understanding, not dominion."

"Everyone who seeks dominion calls it understanding first," I said.

She looked at me. Her eyes were brown, warm, carefully controlled. The composure didn't extend to her qi — under the surface, there was a low hum of anxiety, the kind that comes from standing next to something you don't fully understand and having been told to talk to it.

"Our master proposes cooperation," she said. "The anomalies are affecting the entire region. Cultivators are losing control of their foundations. Villages are being evacuated. The spiritual balance is collapsing." She paused. "He believes you can help stabilize it."

"Because he believes I'm causing it."

Silence.

The fire crackled. Somewhere beyond the circle of light, a night bird called — wrong species, again, and I was tired of noting the wrongness.

"Our master," the woman said carefully, "has observed a correlation between specific qi signatures and the anomaly patterns. He does not presume to assign causation."

"He presumes. He's just polite about it."

She had the grace not to deny it.

"The offer is genuine," she said. "Resources. Information. Access to research that your master —" She caught herself. Reconsidered. " — that Lian Zhuo has compiled over the past two years. The anomaly data is extensive. The pattern analysis, comprehensive."

"And in exchange?"

"Cooperation. Your presence. Your... perspective."

Your perspective. A delicate word for *your qi.* What they wanted was access to the source. What they wanted was to put their talismans near me and harvest the energy that leaked from every step I took, every question I asked, every truth I approached. What they wanted was the furnace, and they were offering to build the chimney.

I stood.

The three cultivators tensed. It was involuntary — the reflexive tightening of people whose bodies have registered a shift in the pressure gradient and whose training says *prepare.* The woman's hand drifted toward her talisman. The flanking men adjusted their stances.

I walked past them.

Not dramatically. Not with menace or display. I simply stood, gathered my robe, and walked past the fire and past the three grey-robed cultivators and out of the light, into the dark, in the direction of the stream where I'd been washing dishes an hour ago.

They watched me go.

Xu Ran's voice carried from the camp: "That was rude."

"That was honest," I said, without turning back.

Silence from the camp. Then the woman's voice, quiet, professional, the sound of someone filing an outcome under *expected:* "We'll be in the area. The offer stands."

Footsteps. Three sets, moving away, synchronized with the practiced ease of people who withdraw as a unit. The sound faded. The night settled back into its usual arrangement of insects and wind and the distant movement of water.

Xu Ran found me at the stream.

"They knew where we were," he said.

"Yes."

"They knew our route."

"Yes."

"They knew — not guessed, KNEW — that you're connected to the anomalies."

"Yes."

He sat on a rock beside the stream. The water moved over stones with the apologetic sound of something that doesn't want to intrude on a conversation but isn't capable of stopping.

"Other people can see it," he said. "What you are. What you do. The Pencil — Lian Zhuo — he's been watching. Studying. He has data we don't. Two years of pattern analysis." He paused. "That might be useful."

"It might be a trap."

"It's definitely a trap. That doesn't mean the data isn't real."

I looked at him. He looked at the water. The stream caught starlight and broke it into moving shapes on his face.

"They'll come back," I said.

"Yes."

"They'll bring more next time. Different arguments. Better bait."

"Probably."

"And eventually they'll stop asking."

He picked up a pebble. Turned it in his fingers. Set it down.

"Then we'd better move," he said.

"I said that already."

"You say a lot of useful things. Implementing them is where you struggle."

I almost smiled. The muscle twitched. The moment passed.

We broke camp that night. Packed in darkness, moved south by moonlight, following trails that wouldn't appear on any map the sect might have because they weren't trails at all, just the spaces between trees and rocks where a body could passage the terrain without leaving traces. I knew these routes because I'd walked them before, years or decades ago, when avoiding attention was a habit rather than a necessity.

Behind us, the camp's abandoned fire sent a thin column of smoke into the sky. The talismans' residual hum faded with distance, growing weaker, losing coherence, until the only qi I could feel was the world's own and the deep, involuntary pulse of whatever lived in my bones and refused to be named.

They would come back. The Pencil would send more people, more offers, more polite academic language wrapped around the same fundamental demand: *let us use you.*

And eventually he would come himself. The quiet one. The academic who spoke like a teacher and unified factions through a ritual that had cost three elders their lives. He would come, and he would be different from his messengers — more dangerous, more patient, more precise.

I was looking forward to it. That was the wrong response. I noted it and kept walking.

"They'll come back," Xu Ran said again, half a step behind me.

"Yes."

"And?"

"And we'll deal with it then."

He didn't argue. That, too, was a kind of trust — the willingness to walk into the dark behind someone who refuses to explain where she's going, armed with nothing but a notebook and the belief that documentation would outlast whatever came next.

The moon set. We walked on.
