# Chapter 29

I stood at the edge of a cliff and told the wind I was mortal.

"I am mortal."

The wind didn't care. The wind was wind — it blew because atmospheric pressure differentials created movement, because temperature gradients produced currents, because the physical world operated on principles that didn't include my declarations. The wind blew. The words dissolved.

Below me: rocks. Water. The specific, honest physics of falling — mass times acceleration, the equation that governed stones and bodies and everything that gravity claimed. Below me: the end, for anyone who wasn't me. The simple, reliable, available end that every mortal carried as a default option, the exit that existence built into every form it produced.

Except mine.

I threw a stone. It fell. Of course it fell — stones don't believe they can fly. Stones don't believe anything. Stones are subject to physics without the complication of consciousness, without the interference of conviction, without the fundamental immunity that belief provides.

I didn't fall.

I wasn't going to fall. Not because of the cliff's engineering, not because of my physical position, not because of any safety measure or protective mechanism. Because I believed I couldn't fall. The belief was deeper than the declaration — deeper than *I am mortal*, deeper than the words, deeper than the conscious intention behind the words. The belief was bedrock. The declaration was paint on the surface.

You can't change a building's foundation by repainting its walls.

Xu Ran waited below. On the trail, fifty meters down, where I'd asked him to wait. He was sitting on a rock, and I could see him from above — small, human-shaped, mortal. The perspective was fitting: looking down at mortality from the position of someone who couldn't reach it.

I stepped back from the edge.

The stepping back was not defeat. Not retreat. Not the abandonment of the attempt. It was the recognition of a category error. I had been trying to change a belief by declaring its opposite, the way a liar tries to become honest by saying *I am honest*. The declaration doesn't change the structure. The words don't reach the foundation. The surface and the core speak different languages, and telling the surface *you are mortal* doesn't translate into the core because the core has been saying *you are immortal* for longer than language has existed.

The gap between knowing and being.

I knew I made myself immortal. The knowledge was complete, verified, confirmed by creation memories and river ripples and years of accumulated evidence that Xu Ran had counted and I had burned. I KNEW. The knowing was intellectual, cognitive, fully articulated, sitting in the part of my mind that processed information and produced conclusions.

The being was somewhere else. The being was in the part of me that didn't process but simply WAS — the part that believed without deciding to believe, that convicted without reasoning toward conviction, that held immortality not as a thought but as a condition. The way I held my height, my face, the color of my eyes. Not chosen. Not maintained. Simply: was.

You don't change the color of your eyes by declaring them different.

I walked down to Xu Ran. The descent was easy — the path cooperated, the terrain smoothed, the mountain yielded. Because I believed in smooth paths. Because the belief operated regardless of my frustration with it.

"Well?" he said.

"Nothing."

He nodded. Not disappointed — he hadn't expected success. He'd expected information, and information was what he'd received. The declaration didn't work. The conscious override didn't work. The gap between knowing and being was real, was physical, was as wide as the cliff was tall.

"Interesting," he said.

"Frustrating."

"Those aren't mutually exclusive."

We walked. South. The trail continued its suspicious cooperation.
