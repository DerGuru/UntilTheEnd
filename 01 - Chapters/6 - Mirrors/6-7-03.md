# Chapter 46

Xu Ran unpacked the bag.

Everything came out. Every item, every piece of dried food, every spare cloth, every tool he'd accumulated across the thousand-mile logistics of traveling with an immortal who didn't technically need supplies and a mortal who absolutely did. He spread it all on the flat rock — a taxonomy of necessities, the visible inventory of survival.

Rice. Two portions left, maybe three if he stretched. Dried meat. Herbs — three kinds, the medicinal ones he'd gathered along the way, the ones he pretended were for flavor but actually kept in a separate pouch labeled in his scholar's notation. Flint. String. The small folding knife. Two cloths. A sewing kit — the one I'd used for the robe, needle and thread and a strip of reinforcing fabric. His notebook. The brush. The ink stone.

He touched each piece. Picked it up, weighed it in his hand — not with a scale but with the calibrated assessment of a man who had been packing and unpacking this bag for long enough that his palms knew the weight of each item and could detect variance. Set it down. Next piece. The procedure was systematic, thorough, the specific kind of inventory that a person performs when the next leg of the journey will not have resupply points.

I watched.

Not from distance — sitting across from him, close enough that the items between us were a shared field, the domestic spread of two people organizing their life on a flat rock on a mountainside. I watched the way he handled each thing — the deliberate contact, the consideration, the decision that each item represented. Keep. Discard. Repack.

This was pragmatism.

Not philosophy. Not metaphor. Not the elevated, significance-laden thinking that had dominated the last several Parts. This was: how much rice, how much water, how many days. This was the mathematics of mortal survival applied with the precision of a man who understood that immortals might not need rice but mortals did and if the mortal stopped eating the mortal stopped walking and if the mortal stopped walking the immortal would be alone.

I watched him count rice grains — not literally, but almost, the attention he gave to the rice bag was the attention of someone for whom each grain represented distance, and distance represented time, and time was the only currency his mortal body traded in.

The millennia as layers of stone.

The thought connected — watching his hands sort provisions into the image that had been forming since the river. The problem of letting go wasn't dramatic. It wasn't a single moment of release, a theatrical opening of fists, a climactic spiritual event. It was geological. Layers accumulated over time that could only be removed over time. Each layer a century of being-this-way, each century compressed by the centuries above it, the whole structure solidified into something that resembled permanence but was still — at its fundamental nature — just layers. Just time. Just accumulated decisions that had hardened into fact.

You don't demolish a mountain by hitting it once.

You demolish a mountain the way a mountain was built — particle by particle, grain by grain, the patient accumulation of tiny changes over timescales that make individual effort seem absurd. Xu Ran's hands on the rice bag, weighing, counting, deciding — this was the method. Piece by piece. Step by step. Not the grand gesture. The daily work.

I reached for a stone near my knee. Picked it up. Ordinary — grey, smooth, river-rounded, the kind of stone that existed in quantities beyond counting on every mountainside in China. I held it. Turned it. Felt its weight — actual weight, body-apprehended weight, the stone in my palm registering through skin and nerve and the mechanical sensitivity of fingers against mass.

I set it down.

No warping. No conviction. No alteration of reality. I picked up a stone and I put it down and the stone was unchanged and my hand was unchanged and the act was the most unremarkable thing in the world and that was the point. Not every action needed to be meaningful. Not every gesture needed to carry the weight of immortality. Some things were just things. Some stones were just stones. Some actions were just hands picking up and putting down and the universe continuing its operations without commentary.

Xu Ran finished his inventory. Began repacking. The order had changed — optimized, redistributed, the new arrangement reflecting updated calculations about weight distribution and accessibility and the number of days between here and wherever we were going.

He looked up.

"Tomorrow?"

The word — simple, practical, meaning nothing more than: do we leave tomorrow, do we continue tomorrow, is tomorrow the next step.

"Tomorrow," I said.

Tomorrow. The next day. One day. Not all the days, not the seven-book accumulation of days that stretched behind us like a road that went to the horizon and beyond. One day. Tomorrow. The smallest unit of forward motion.

The fox-spirit was sleeping nearby. Curled, tail over nose, the compact efficiency of an animal at rest. It breathed. The small, regular exhalations of a body that knew how to sleep — completely, without reservation, without the half-waking vigilance that characterized human rest.

I helped him pack. Handed items — the rice bag, the herbs, the cloths. My hands doing hand-things. Practical, grounded, physical. The needle and thread went into the side pocket. The ink stone, wrapped in its cloth, went near the bottom where the weight would settle.

We packed the bag together.

The shape of the packed bag was the shape of tomorrow — contained, finite, carrying exactly what was needed for the next step and nothing more.
