# Chapter 44

The mountain path climbed.

Not aggressively — the gradient was the patient, sustained incline of a trail that understood it had altitude to gain and time to gain it. Switchbacks through pine, the trees thinning as we rose, the air sharpening with elevation into something that tasted like cold metal and distance. Spring had arrived while I wasn't paying attention — blossoms on the lower branches, the specific pink-white that looked like snow if you squinted and looked like blossoms if you didn't, the annual insistence of biology doing its work regardless of who was watching.

The air was cold.

I felt it. Had been feeling it since B5, would keep feeling it — the sharpened sensory register that had returned cold to my experience like a guest who comes back and refuses to leave. But this cold was different. This cold was pleasant. The crisp, clean, almost refreshing cold of altitude in spring, the air that tastes like it's been washed and put out to dry. I breathed it in and the breathing was an act of small pleasure rather than survival.

Xu Ran walked three steps behind me.

He'd been doing this since B4. Three steps — not two, not four, the deliberate, calibrated distance of a man who had determined the optimal spacing between companion and observed, between presence and intrusion. Three steps that said: I am here, I am with you, I am not crowding.

I stopped.

Turned.

He was there — three steps back, walking staff in one hand, the other hooked through his pack strap, his expression the neutral concentration of a man navigating terrain. He stopped because I stopped. The responsiveness of someone whose walking speed was not his own but hers.

"You're still walking behind me," I said.

He looked at the gap between us. At me. At the gap again, as if measuring it with the precision of a man for whom measurement was profession.

"You walk fast," he said.

Not a complaint. Not an excuse. A statement of fact delivered with the specific intonation of a man who had learned to be funny by refusing to be funny, whose humor lived in the deadpan delivery of objectively true observations that happened to be entertaining. His face — almost. The micro-expression that was as close to a grin as his features would allow, the crack that appeared and vanished like a ripple.

I looked at him. Three steps back. Walking staff. Pack. The scholar who had followed an immortal into the mountains because his concept of a reasonable life decision differed fundamentally from that of ordinary people.

The moment was lighter than anything in Part 5 or Part 6. Not light — lighter. The difference between a stone you carry and a stone you carry well. The weight was there — the millennia, the insight, the letting-go-that-hadn't-happened-yet, the Wei-question that would never close. All of it, present, carried, weighed. But the carrying was — better. The load had not decreased. The shoulders had adjusted.

"Neben mir," I said. Beside me.

He looked at me. The consideration — quick, subtle, the rapid processing of implications that his mind performed on every data point before categorizing it. Then he walked the three steps. Stood beside me. The gap closed.

We walked.

Side by side, the path barely wide enough for two. His shoulder near my shoulder — not touching, the maintained margin of a man who understood physical proximity as a calibrated variable. The fox-spirit trotted ahead, unbothered by the reorganization of walking arrangements, its tail a low curve, its pace the efficient trot of an animal that had been leading longer than either of us.

The blossoms. The air. The specific beauty of a Chinese mountain in spring that existed independently of anyone's capacity to appreciate it but was better — demonstrably, measurably better — when appreciated.

I had the tools.

The knowledge sat in me like the cold sat in the air — present, clear, available. The mechanism of conviction: belief shapes reality, not will. The target: letting go. The method: release, not grip. Opening, not closing. The water-through-fingers, the sash-in-the-river, the open hands. I knew what needed to happen.

But the millennia stood between knowing and doing. Layers upon layers, compressed by time into something nearly geological — the conviction-strata that constituted the architecture of immortality, each layer a century's worth of being-this-way, each century a weight that made the layer beneath it harder. You didn't dismantle geology overnight. You didn't dismantle geology by wanting to dismantle it.

You dismantled it the way geology was made — slowly, through the patient application of forces that didn't care about timelines.

"The blossoms are early this year," Xu Ran said.

"You track that?"

"I track everything."

Of course he did. The man who documented temperature fluctuations and seasonal patterns and the migration schedules of birds he could name in three languages. The man whose notebook was the most comprehensive natural history of central China written by someone who was simultaneously writing the most comprehensive supernatural history of central China. He tracked the blossoms because the blossoms were data and data was devotion and devotion was how Xu Ran loved.

We walked beside each other through blossoms that were early and air that was cold and a morning that carried the weight of everything we knew and managed, somehow, to be lighter than the mornings that had preceded it.

The fox-spirit found something in the underbrush. Paused. Investigated. Found it unworthy. Continued.

The path climbed.
