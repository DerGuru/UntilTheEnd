# Chapter 15

The triggers accumulated the way water accumulated in a vessel with no drain — silently, measurably, until the vessel's capacity was exceeded and the excess had nowhere to go except over the edge.

Trigger one: Xu Ran.

He was still here. Twenty-three days — he said twenty-three, and the number was the kind of precision that he maintained and I didn't and the maintenance was his contribution to the shared reality. Twenty-three days of the ten-pace distance and the notebook and the cooking and the meditation and the questions that I sometimes answered and mostly didn't and the persistence that was not patience because patience implied waiting for something and he was not waiting. He was working. Every day was data. Every silence was data. Every word I produced — the count had risen from zero to single digits per day, an increase that he tracked — was data.

He was here and every day he was here was a day that the isolation was not total and the not-total was the crack and the crack was widening.

Trigger two: the wrongness.

A second tree. Different location. Same anomaly — branches that were not oriented the way they should have been, the specific deviation from expected growth pattern that registered as unease rather than alarm. And the shadow, repeated — another shadow, different rock, same wrong angle. And a sound, once: a bird call that echoed when there was no surface for it to echo from. The echo repeated twice. Then stopped.

Echoes.

Xu Ran documented everything. Three pages of anomalies. The documentation was his fortress — if it was written, it was real, and if it was real, it was not imagined, and if it was not imagined, then the world was doing something and the something was worth understanding.

"The pattern is spatial," he said, reviewing his notes. "The anomalies cluster near you. Within fifty paces. Outside of that — nothing."

Near me. The wrongness was near me the way the death-radius was near me. The wrongness was mine.

I said nothing. The nothing was informative.

Trigger three: the sects.

Xu Ran heard rumors — how he heard them, I did not track. He talked to someone, somewhere, in one of the intervals when I walked and he walked behind me and the walking passed through the vicinity of other humans. He talked. He returned.

"More are coming," he said. "Two groups. One from the west, one from the north. They know you're here."

They knew I was here because I left a trail of dead vegetation that could be seen from a ridge, because my existence announced itself in the specific language of ecological destruction, because being me was the equivalent of lighting a fire on a mountaintop and being surprised when people came to investigate.

The sects were coming. The sects would arrive. The sects would bring their formations and their calculations and their institutional authority and I would break them or they would not find me or some combination and either way the interaction would produce the nothing that all interactions produced.

Except — the search-impulse. The thing from the fight. The turning-toward. The dropping of shoulders. The going-to-meet instead of waiting-to-be-found. The impulse was still there, below the disconnection, in the layer that operated without will. The impulse said: more are coming. The impulse did not say: avoid.

Trigger four: silence.

Xu Ran slept. Early on the twenty-second night — exhausted from walking, from the terrain's increasing difficulty, from the specific physical cost of following an immortal at a ten-pace distance for three weeks with a broken core. He slept early and deeply and his sleep was silent and his silence was the thing that returned when his noise stopped.

I was alone.

Not alone in the way I had been alone in Part 1 — the standing, the walking, the undifferentiated existence-without-engagement. Alone in the new way. The way that included the awareness of someone else's presence and the awareness of that presence's temporary absence and the awareness that the temporary absence was different from total absence and the difference was: worse.

Total absence was the baseline. The disconnection operated in total absence the way a system operated in its designed environment. Total absence was the condition for which the disconnection was calibrated.

Xu Ran's temporary absence was interference. The system had adjusted — slightly, minimally, the absolute-zero-plus-three-degrees adjustment that twenty-three days of cooking and meditation and notebook had produced — and the adjustment meant that the system's baseline had shifted and the shift meant that returning to the old baseline was now: noticeable.

The silence was noticeable.

Not peaceful. Not restful. Not the absence of sound as a positive condition. The silence was the specific negative — the awareness that sound should be here and wasn't and the should-be betrayed the fact that expectation had returned and expectation was a function of wanting and wanting was closer than it should have been.

I sat by the dead fire. Brown grass. Stars. The humming in my chest.

I spoke.

One sentence. Quiet. To no one — to the clearing, to the stars, to the space where Xu Ran's noise usually existed and where it didn't exist now.

"Wei would have hated this."

The sound of my own voice in the silence was the most alarming thing that had happened since the hut. Not the content — Wei would have hated the forest, hated the sitting, hated the specific passive deterioration that I was performing. The content was observation. The alarm was the production. I had spoken to the absence. I had addressed the nothing as if the nothing were available for conversation.

I had spoken aloud and the speaking aloud was the specific behavior of someone who was isolated and whose isolation was becoming insufferable and whose insufferable was a word that required the detection of suffering and suffering required the detection of preference and preference was — 

Closer. Preference was closer than the disconnection permitted. Preference was leaking through the crack that Xu Ran's words had made and the question had widened and the irritation had confirmed and the almost-smile had implied.

The alarm was not dramatic. The alarm was the quiet kind — the internal recognition that a state had changed and that the change was irreversible in the way that cracks were irreversible. The glass could not un-crack. The preference could not un-return. The three words spoken to empty air could not be un-spoken.

I was alone and the aloneness was unbearable and the unbearable was a measurement and the measurement said: enough.

The fire was ash. The stars moved. Xu Ran's breathing was the only sound — the even, unconscious respiration of someone whose body maintained itself while his mind was elsewhere.

I sat. In the unbearable. In the enough.

The four triggers were not a sequence. They were not cause-and-effect, not dominos, not the linear progression that narrative suggested. They were simultaneous. They were the combined pressure of Xu Ran's presence and the world's wrongness and the sects' approach and the silence's insufferability and the combination was not the sum of the parts. The combination was the product. The multiplication of four insufficient forces into one sufficient force.

Sufficient force for what, I did not yet know. The knowing would come in the morning. The morning would come whether I participated or not. The participation was the thing that was changing.

I sat until dawn. When Xu Ran woke, I was sitting where I had been. But something was different. Something was different in the way that three degrees was different from absolute zero — technically, measurably, in the specific register that only precision instruments could detect.

He detected it.

He opened his notebook. He looked at me. He looked at the notebook. He wrote one word. Then he closed it.
