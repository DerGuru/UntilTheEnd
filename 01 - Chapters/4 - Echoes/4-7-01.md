# Chapter 51

The morning was grey and physical and true.

Ash from the fire. The specific grey residue of wood burned through the night — white at the center where the heat was greatest, grey at the periphery, the gradient of combustion. The ash covered the ground in a circle around the fire pit and beyond the circle: devastation. Fallen trees. Fissured earth. The radius of her protection made visible in snapped trunks and displaced soil.

I sat on a stone. My shirt was torn — the sleeve missing, used for his bandage, the remaining fabric insufficient and dirty and bearing the specific evidence of a night spent tending a fire and a man. Dust in my hair. His blood still on my hands, the dried-brown patina that resisted casual washing.

Xu Ran was under the blanket I had taken from his pack. The blanket covered everything except his face, which was: pale. Pallor of blood loss. The laceration bandage had bled through during the night — a dark stain through my sleeve-fabric that indicated the wound was deeper than the initial assessment had suggested. His breathing was shallow, the ribs dictating depth.

He woke.

The specific transition — a change in respiratory pattern, a facial contraction, the eyes opening with the particular squint of someone returning to consciousness through pain. He woke and the waking was accompanied by: coughing.

The cough was deep and wet and immediately punished by the ribs. He curled — the involuntary protective response, the body folding around the broken structure. The cough continued. Three repetitions. Each one producing the facial expression of: stop. Each one continuing regardless.

Eventually the coughing settled. He straightened — slowly. The careful, incremental motion of someone for whom every degree of change was a negotiation with pain. He sat up. The blanket fell. The bandage was visible. The swelling around his left eye was: advanced. Purple-yellow. The specific chromatic progression of subcutaneous hemorrhage entering its forty-eight-hour phase.

He was dizzy. I could see it — the way his eyes tracked and then corrected, the specific saccadic instability that indicated vestibular disturbance from the concussion. He sat upright but the uprightness was precarious. His hand went to the ground. Stabilizing.

"Water," I said. I handed him the water-skin. He drank. Small sips. The specific careful hydration of someone whose diaphragm was compromised by structural damage.

He looked around. At the destroyed clearing. At the fallen trees. At me. At the stone I sat on. At the grey and physical and true morning.

He said nothing about the destruction. He said nothing about the night. He said nothing about the word — *Ich* — that had been the last spoken thing between them.

He reached for his pack. Found the rice. Looked at it. Put it down.

"Not yet," he said.

The ribs. Cooking required motion. Motion required breath. Breath required ribs that were not broken but his were.

I stood. I took the rice. I took the pot. I built the cooking fire from the residual embers and the broken wood that surrounded us in abundance.

I cooked.

The cooking was: mechanical. The specific practiced motions of food preparation that she had performed in various configurations for millennia. Water. Rice. Heat. Duration. The sequence was stored in the procedural memory that the substrate's erasures did not reach because the cooking was not threatening to whatever the substrate was protecting.

Xu Ran watched. From his position on the ground. His good eye — the right one, the unswollen one — tracking her motions with the specific observational intensity that was his nature. His notebook was still missing. Somewhere in the debris. He could not document.

I served the rice. In the bowl. Placed it beside him. Moved back to my stone.

He ate. Slowly. Each breath between bites calculated for the ribs.

We did not speak.

After — after the eating, after the fire burned lower, after the morning progressed from grey to the slightly-less-grey of overcast — he stood. The standing was an event. The specific physical project of a man with broken ribs achieving vertical orientation. He stood, and swayed, and caught himself, and stood.

"We should move," he said.

We should move. Because staying in the circle of destruction was not: sustainable. Because the location was evidence, and evidence attracted attention, and attention was unwelcome. Because the pragmatism that governed his behavior was also operational through broken ribs.

We walked. He walked. Slowly.

I matched his pace. The matching was automatic — the specific ambulatory adjustment that she performed without conscious decision. He walked slowly because his ribs were broken and his balance was compromised and his body was operating at diminished capacity. She walked slowly because he was walking slowly.

She did not name this. She did not say: I'm walking slowly because you're injured. She did not adjust her pace ostentatiously or with visible care. She simply: walked at his speed.

He noticed. I saw him notice — the specific sideways glance, the assessment, the cataloguing of the data point. She is walking at my speed. She has adjusted. She has not mentioned the adjustment.

He said nothing.

The morning continued. Grey. Physical. True. Two people walking through a forest — one hindered, one unhurt. The unhurt one walking at the hindered one's pace. The specific arrangement that was not tenderness and not guilt and not obligation but some fourth thing that she did not have vocabulary for and that she would not examine because examining was the province of the substrate's headaches and she did not want a headache today.

They walked. He coughed occasionally. She waited when he paused. They walked.
