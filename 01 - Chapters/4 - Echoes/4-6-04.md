# Chapter 46

I tore my sleeve.

The motion was automatic. Thousands of years of automatic — the practiced mechanics of someone who had dressed wounds in wars, in villages, in the specific and repetitive situations that immortality presented when you lived long enough to see every possible injury. I tore my sleeve at the seam. The fabric separated. I folded it. I pressed it against the laceration on his temple.

Blood. His blood. On my hands. On the fabric. On the ground.

His breathing was shallow and wet and the wetness was blood in the airways and the blood was because his ribs were broken and the ribs were broken because of me.

Druckverband. The word arrived in a language that I used to know — German, or something like German, a linguistic fossil from a period that the memory system had not erased because the word was attached to muscle memory and muscle memory was deeper than cognitive memory. Druckverband. Pressure bandage. The specific medical intervention that controlled bleeding through applied force.

I pressed. The fabric against the wound. The wound against the skull. My hand against the fabric. The specific chain of pressure that transmitted force from my functioning body through the medium to his damaged one.

I needed water. The stream was two hundred paces west. The distance was: too far to leave him.

Fire. He would go into shock if he was not already. Core temperature would drop. I needed fire and I needed water and I needed to be in two places and I could only be in one.

Fire first.

I released the pressure bandage — held in place by positioning his head against the ground at the specific angle that gravity maintained force on the wound. I gathered wood. The wood was everywhere — the shockwave had produced it, the cracked and fallen trees providing fuel in abundance. I gathered it. I arranged it. I struck the flint from his pack — his pack, blown ten paces but intact, the specific durability of a traveler's equipment.

Fire.

The flames took. The warmth began. The specific thermal output of a fire built from fresh-broken wood — irregular, smoky, but: warm. I positioned him closer. Carefully. The ribs. The arm. The specific anatomical concerns that limited movement.

Water.

I went. Two hundred paces, fast. The specific proprioceptive mechanics that an immortal body produced — the speed without strain, the distance without fatigue. I was there and back in minutes. His water-cloth. The filtration system he used. I filled it. I returned.

I cleaned the wound. Temple laceration. Deep enough for concern, shallow enough that the skull was intact. The blood was slowing — the pressure bandage had worked, the clotting was beginning, the specific biological processes that mortal bodies employed when they were damaged were: functioning.

His arm. Dislocated, not broken. I could feel the joint — displaced, the specific malformation that indicated the humerus had separated from the scapula. I could reset it. I had reset thousands.

I braced his shoulder. I took the arm. I pulled — the specific rotational force that relocation required, the technique that was: painful, necessary, violent in its precision.

The joint seated. The pop. The sound of anatomy resuming its designed configuration.

He did not wake. The concussion held him under.

I sat back. On the churned ground. In the circle of destruction. The fire between us — between me and the unconscious man whose ribs were broken by my protection.

My hands were shaking.

I looked at them. My hands. The hands that had torn the sleeve and pressed the bandage and built the fire and relocated the joint. They were shaking. The specific involuntary tremor that indicated a neurological event beyond conscious control — the shaking was not cold, not fatigue, not the mechanical consequence of exertion. The shaking was: emotional.

My hands were shaking because of what I had done.

Not the poison experiment. Not the scientific procedure. What I had done: to him. My protection had nearly killed him. My continued existence — the thing that the thing-below-qi maintained at any cost — had treated the nearest human being as irrelevant collateral. The shockwave had not discriminated. The shockwave had protected me and destroyed everything else and the everything else included the person who had spent months documenting my existence with the specific, compulsive care of someone who considered my survival: worthwhile.

I looked at my shaking hands. I looked at the unconscious man. I looked at the devastation.

Two realizations. Simultaneous.

First: what kept me alive came from inside me. Not external. Not imposed. Not a curse, not a god, not a system. It was IN me. Part of me. The thing below the qi — the thing that woke and warmed and protected and destroyed — it was mine. It lived where I lived. It occupied the same body.

Second: it protected only me. Everything else — everyone else — was acceptable damage. Xu Ran at ten paces. Wei at whatever distance Wei had been. Everyone who had ever stood close to me during one of the moments when the thing-below responded. All of them: acceptable damage to the protection that served only: me.

I was the danger. I had always been the danger.

I knelt there. In the destroyed clearing. My hands shaking. His blood on my fingers, his breathing wet and shallow, his ribs broken by the thing that lived inside me and loved me enough to kill anything near me if it felt the need.

"Ich tue das," I said.

German again. The fossil language. The words that the deeper memory attached to the deeper understanding. I am doing this. Not I did this — I AM doing this. Present tense. Ongoing. Every moment of my continued existence was a moment of potential lethality to anyone in proximity.

*Rein.*

The word arrived without my permission. From the place where the Monolog-Spaltung had not yet occurred, from the place where the direction existed, from the place where the cliff had set the compass bearing. Rein. Inward. The answer is inside.

The answer was inside. The danger was inside. The protection was inside. Everything was inside. And the inside was: me.

I sat beside the fire. I waited. His breathing continued. The wet sound diminished over the hours — the blood was clearing from his airways. The ribs would take weeks. Mortal bodies healed at mortal speed.

I waited. My hands shook. The fire burned the shattered wood. The sky did what skies did — moved, changed, performed the specific celestial choreography that was indifferent to the small catastrophe on the ground below.

He was alive. I had done this. Both facts were simultaneous and the simultaneity was: the thing I needed to hold.
