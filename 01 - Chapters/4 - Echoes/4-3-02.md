# Chapter 19

The path wasn't there.

We had been walking east — or the direction that Xu Ran's map suggested was east, the map being the cartographic reference that he carried and consulted and that I did not consult because consulting required the kind of directed engagement that the disconnection impaired. East, through forest that thickened as the terrain changed from foothills to the specific lowland density that old growth produced in river-adjacent regions.

The thickening terminated. Not gradually — abruptly. The specific wall of vegetation that occurred when competing growth-systems reached equilibrium and the equilibrium produced a boundary and the boundary was: impenetrable. Bramble. Thorn-bush. The layered defense of a forest that had decided this direction was unavailable.

"Dead end," Xu Ran said, studying the wall. "We need to go around."

Around was north or south. North was uphill. South was — I didn't know what south was. South was the direction I would have to look to assess and looking required the kind of evaluative attention that was available but expensive and the expense was not justified by the outcome because north and south were equivalent in the absence of preference.

The frustration was not about direction.

The frustration — and it was frustration, the specific categorical emotion that operated on the functional-emotion axis that the disconnection had not severed — was about obstruction. About the specific reality of a wall of vegetation that was between me and forward. About the fact that forward was the only direction that the departure-vector recognized and the only direction that the body wanted to go and the wanting — the wanting was present. Not the full wanting, not the deliberate preference-based wanting that characterized will. The involuntary wanting. The need-based wanting that lived below the severed cable.

I wanted forward. Forward was blocked. The block was frustrating.

Here should be a path.

Not a thought. An impulse. The specific neurological event that preceded thoughts and that lived in the space between perception and language, in the pre-verbal stratum where the brain processed reality before the mind commented on it. An impulse that was also a statement and the statement was: here should be a path.

The bramble opened.

Not visibly. Not in the manner of branches retracting or thorns withdrawing or the dramatic rearrangement that mythological barriers performed when heroes spoke the correct words. The bramble did not move. The bramble had not moved. The path was there.

The path had always been there.

A gap in the vegetation — narrow, leaf-littered, the specific width that permitted one person passage at a time. Old. Established. The edges worn by use that had accumulated over years, the sides where growth had been pushed back by the passage of bodies, the ground compressed by the weight of feet. The path was old and used and present and real in every measurable way.

Except it hadn't been there thirty seconds ago.

I stood. At the entrance to the path. The path that existed. The path that existed the way the tree exists that you turn to look at — it was there when you looked, and the question of whether it had been there before you looked was the question that could not be answered because looking was the only method of verification.

The path looked old. The path looked permanent. The path looked like a feature of the landscape that had been here since the bramble grew and that the bramble had grown around because paths were older than bramble and the path had precedence.

The path had not been here thirty seconds ago.

I walked onto it. The ground was firm. The leaf litter: years' worth. The specific accumulation of organic material that forests produced on surfaces that were exposed to canopy-drop for extended periods. Years. On a path that existed for thirty seconds.

Retroactive.

The word surfaced from the analytical subsystem that operated below the disconnection, from the category of things I understood because I had encountered them in different forms across different centuries. Retroactive: applied after the fact. Back-dated. The path had not been created — the path had been inserted into the timeline at a point that predated the present, and the insertion had been comprehensive enough that the evidence of long-term existence was genuine. The leaf litter was real. The wear was real. The growth-pattern of the bramble-around-the-path was real. Everything was real in the specific way that reality was real when reality had been edited.

I did not stop walking. I did not examine the path. I did not perform any analysis. I walked through the gap in the bramble on the path that had always existed and that had existed for thirty seconds and that was both things simultaneously.

Behind me, at ten paces, Xu Ran followed. His footsteps on the leaf litter: the specific sound of boots on compressed organic material. He walked where I walked. He followed the path that hadn't been there.

He was quiet. Not the quiet of someone who hadn't noticed — the quiet of someone who was processing. The processing was visible in the absence of his usual commentary, in the closed notebook, in the specific silence that Xu Ran produced when the data exceeded his framework and the framework needed expansion before the data could be accommodated.

The path continued for forty paces. Through the bramble wall. Into the forest beyond — open, navigable, the specific terrain that the path led to and that the bramble had blocked and that was now accessible.

We emerged. The forest ahead was normal. The path behind was — 

Was.

I did not look back. Looking back would be confirmation. Looking back would be the specific behavior of someone who was checking whether the impossible thing was still there and the checking would be the acknowledgment and the acknowledgment would be the first step toward understanding and understanding was — 

Not yet. Understanding was not yet. Understanding required engagement and engagement required will and will was the cable and the cable was still —

Almost.

Almost severed. Almost disconnected. Almost — but not completely. The frustration had produced the path and the path was the evidence and the evidence said the cable was not completely cut and the not-completely was the space in which impossible things happened.

The forest opened ahead. I walked into it. Behind me: Xu Ran. Behind Xu Ran: the path.

The path that had always been there.
