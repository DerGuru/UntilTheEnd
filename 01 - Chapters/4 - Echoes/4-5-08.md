# Chapter 40

We did not speak about the smile for three days.

Three days of walking. Three days of the ten-pace distance and the gradient and the notebook and the specific arrangement that our coexistence had refined into something approaching rhythm. Three days during which the smile existed between us the way an object existed on a table — present, visible, not discussed.

On the third day, I stopped.

Not the headache-stop — the deliberate stop. The specific cessation of forward motion that a person performed when the person had reached a conclusion and the conclusion required: stillness.

I had reached a conclusion.

The memory came first. The trigger was unclear — not a smell, not a temperature, not the standard Andock categories. The trigger was: the disgust. The residual disgust that had been present since the clearing, since the hand-to-mouth, since the specific moment when pleasure and violence had fused into something that the body recognized as: dangerous.

The memory opened.

A war. Different era — the specific temporal designation that I used for the periods of my existence that existed at the boundary between memory and mythology. The war was large enough to be regional and long enough to be generational and I was in it because I was in all things that occurred near me, because proximity was the condition and the condition was: permanent.

I was on a battlefield. After. The specific after of a battle — the smoking terrain, the scattered bodies, the environmental destruction that organized violence produced. After, when the fighting was done and the outcome was determined and the remaining activity was: assessment.

I was laughing.

Not the quiet laugh of irony or the bitter laugh of recognition. Laughing. The full deployment of the physiological apparatus that laughter required — diaphragm, vocal cords, the muscular configuration of the face that produced the sound and the sound was: amusement. I was amused. By the battlefield. By the bodies. By the specific totality of destruction that surrounded me and that I had contributed to and that had contributed nothing to me.

I remembered the laugh the way one remembered a photograph of oneself from a different era — recognizable, distant, the specific uncanniness of seeing your own face doing something that your current face would not do. I was that person. I had laughed on a battlefield. I had found the violence amusing in the specific way that only someone whose personal stake was zero could find violence amusing — the amusement of the invulnerable, the comedy of the immune.

The laugh on the battlefield and the smile in the clearing were the same expression separated by centuries. The same neural pathway. The same reward activation. The same pleasure-from-violence that the body produced when the violence was successful and the success was effortless and the effortless was the specific condition that made violence entertaining rather than threatening.

The memory was twelve sentences and the twelve sentences changed something.

The conclusion was the thing that the three days of walking had produced, the thing that the disgust had generated, the thing that the memory confirmed:

If I continued fighting, I would become the person who laughed on battlefields.

Not become — return. The person who laughed on battlefields was not a future version of me. The person who laughed on battlefields was a past version of me. A version that existed in the memory along with the blind warrior and the woman who cooked and the boy who said liar. The laughing-on-battlefields version was real and was mine and was: available. One more fight. Two more fights. The specific number of repetitions that would transition the smile from anomaly to feature. From: this happened, how terrible, to: this happens, it's fine.

No.

The no was not the substrate's no. The no was mine. The first fully formed, fully owned, fully conscious decision since the cliff. The no that existed in the category of will — not need, not impulse, not the pre-verbal substrate-level events that had driven most of my recent behavior. Will. The specific cognitive product that a mind produced when the mind engaged with a choice and selected one option and rejected the other and the rejection was: final.

No more fights.

Not: no more violence. The universe would provide violence and the universe would be met with whatever the universe provided. But the seeking — the turning-toward, the SUCHE, the specific impulse that had driven me to walk toward the three and the eight and the beasts and the bandits — the seeking was done. The seeking was the thing that had produced the pleasure and the pleasure was the thing that had produced the smile and the smile was the line and the line was: crossed.

No more seeking violence because violence felt good. No more walking toward the stimulus because the stimulus was the only thing that was real. No more.

"Weiter," Xu Ran said.

He was behind me. At the distance. He had been walking while I had been standing and the standing had produced a gap and the gap had produced his word and the word was: forward.

*Weiter.*

The word. His word. The word that meant forward, next, continue. The word that refused the static. He said it the way he said his own name — as fact, as identity, as the specific syllable that contained everything about who he was and what he did and why. Weiter. Keep going. Not backward. Not static. Forward.

I heard it. The word entered the space where the no was — the space of decision, of will, of the first conscious choice. The no and the weiter occupied the same space. No more fighting. Keep going. Both directives. Both: forward. Both pointing at the thing that came after the thing that had just ended.

The silence that followed was the specific silence that occurred between people who had reached the same conclusion separately and whose separate conclusions had converged on the same point. We would continue. We would not fight. We would walk and investigate and the investigation would produce whatever it produced and the producing would not include violence as methodology.

I walked.

He followed.

The distance: ten paces. The gradient: brown to yellow to green. The arrangement: unchanged. But the arrangement's content — the specific quality of the motion that the arrangement contained — was different. Before the smile, we had been walking-to-find. After the smile, we were walking-to-understand. The distinction was the distinction between hunting and research. Between moving through the world aggressively and moving through the world attentively.

The talisman in my robe: present. The pendant with marks I had not yet understood. The new one. The data that would become relevant later, in a context I could not yet see.

The memory of the laugh: present. Filed. Not erased — the substrate had not taken this one. Perhaps because this memory was not investigation-adjacent. Perhaps because this memory served the substrate's purpose: deterrence. If I remembered what I became when I fought, I would stop fighting. The substrate wanted me to stop fighting because fighting disturbed the system and the system wanted: stability.

We walked. The sun moved. The terrain continued its indifferent provision of geography. Behind us: seven disabled cultivators and one running. Ahead: the investigation, the notebook, the headaches, the things I had not yet found.

No more fights.

The decision held. The will — jury-rigged, makeshift, the cable reconnected with tape and hope — the will held the decision. For now. For this section.

For weiter.
