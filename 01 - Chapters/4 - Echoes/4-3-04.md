# Chapter 21

The spirit-beasts came at dawn. The bandits came twenty minutes later. The combination was coincidence or design or the specific configuration of the universe that placed two sources of violence at the same coordinates at approximately the same time because the universe was occasionally efficient in its distribution of problems.

Two spirit-beasts. Different species — one the cat-type that operated in forested terrain, the size of a large dog, qi-armored, fast. The other: something bovine, heavier, slower, the kind that charged and that used mass as its primary weapon. Neither was dangerous. Not to me. Not in the category of things that constituted danger on the scale that my capabilities measured danger.

I yawned.

Not performatively — genuinely. The specific involuntary reflex that the body produced when a stimulus was insufficient to generate the arousal response that the organism expected. The spirit-beasts were insufficient. They were the equivalent of math problems I had solved before the math had a name.

The cat-type moved first. Fast — the acceleration of a predator whose muscle configuration was optimized for the initial burst. It covered the distance between us in the time it took the thought it's-fast to form and dissolve. Fast for what it was. Slow for what I was.

I stepped aside. The specific geometry of avoidance that required less than a body's width of lateral movement and that used the beast's own momentum as the mechanism of its failure. It passed me. Its claws found the space I had occupied. The space was empty by the time the claws arrived.

The bovine charged. Direct. The linear application of mass-times-velocity that required no subtlety and that relied on the assumption that the target would be where the target was when the charge began. I was not where I was when the charge began. The bovine's horn cut air. The air was cooperative.

I dealt with both in the interval that Xu Ran later described as "less than I could track." Which was his way of saying: fast enough that his perception — human-speed, cultivator-enhanced but still fundamentally human-speed — lost the sequence.

The bandits arrived as the beasts were falling. Four of them. Armed — swords, one spear, the specific armament of opportunistic predators who operated at the margins of civilization and who had perhaps been tracking the beasts or perhaps been tracking us or perhaps been tracking the specific convergence of violent opportunity that our location provided.

They saw the beasts — falling, unconscious, the specific limpness of qi-channel shutdown that I had applied with the efficiency of someone who had been doing this for longer than their species had been cultivating.

They reassessed.

The reassessment took approximately the same duration as the fight — a breath, maybe two. The specific interval in which calculation determined that the cost-benefit ratio of engaging the person who had just incapacitated two spirit-beasts in a fraction of a second was not favorable.

Two of them ran. Two of them — the specific kind of stupid that survival pressures had not yet eliminated — advanced.

I gähnte again.

The first one reached me and I let him.

He swung. A sword — functional, maintained, the specific weapon of someone who used it regularly and who cared about it in the way that professionals cared about their tools. The sword came in a horizontal arc. Standard. The kind of attack that worked against targets that were unable to avoid it.

I could have avoided it. The way I had avoided the cat-type, the way I had avoided the bovine, the way I avoided everything that came at me with the casual ease of a body that had been doing this for millennia. I could have stepped aside and the sword would have found air and the bandit would have found the ground.

I didn't.

The sword caught my sleeve. Left arm. Upper. The fabric tore — the specific sound of woven material separating under the application of a sharpened edge. The blade continued through the fabric and into flesh. My flesh. The specific sensation of —

Pain.

The pain was: present. Clear. The specific frequency that physical damage produced in a nervous system that was fully functional and that received pain signals without filtering them. The blade entered my arm and the nerves fired and the firing was a signal and the signal was pain and the pain was the first thing in weeks that was completely, undeniably, unambiguously real.

I breathed it in.

Not metaphorically. The pain arrived and I inhaled and the inhalation was the involuntary response to the first genuine sensation that had penetrated the disconnection since the forest. The pain was not filtered. The pain was not numbed. The pain was a clean line through the static, the specific signal that existed in the frequency that the disconnection could not block because the disconnection operated on will and pain operated on nerves and nerves were older than will.

Blood. My blood. The specific color and viscosity of blood that had been inside me and was now outside and the outside was warm and wet on my arm and the warmth was real and the wetness was real.

The bandit saw the blood. His face — for one breath — showed the specific expression of someone who believed they had succeeded, who believed the blade in the arm was the beginning of the end, who believed the blood was the evidence of mortality.

Then it healed.

Not instantly — with a delay. A one-second delay. The specific interval during which the wound was open and the blood was flowing and the pain was present and the delay was: mine. I held it. One second. Not consciously — the way one held a breath before releasing it, the way one paused at the top of an inhalation, the specific moment of suspension that occurred between intake and release.

One second of pain. Then the flesh closed. The skin sealed. The blood — still on the surface, still warm — was the only evidence that the wound had existed.

The bandit's expression changed. The specific transition from triumph to a category that did not have a standard name but that occupied the space between disbelief and religious terror.

I ended him. His capacity to fight, not his life — the wrist technique from the earlier encounter, the specific application that disabled without destroying. He screamed. He fell. The second bandit was already running by the time the first hit the ground.

I stood. In the clearing. Two beasts unconscious. Two bandits disabled. Sleeve: torn. Blood: drying. Pain: fading.

The fading was the loss. The pain had been present and now the pain was leaving and the leaving was the specific subtraction that I had tried to delay with the one-second pause. The pain was the only thing that had been completely real and now the pain was —

Gone.

Xu Ran stood at the clearing's edge. Notebook open. His face was pale in a way that was becoming familiar — the pale of someone whose data had expanded beyond his framework for the third time this week.

"You did that on purpose," he said.

Not a question. Not an accusation. The observation of someone who had watched the sequence — the avoiding, the not-avoiding, the letting-through, the delay, the healing — and who had understood the sequence's internal logic and whose understanding was: she chose to be hurt.

"Be quiet," I said.

He wrote it down.
