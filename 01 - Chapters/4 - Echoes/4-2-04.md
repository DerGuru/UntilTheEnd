# Chapter 11

The tree was wrong.

Not dramatically — not the kind of wrong that announced itself, not the kind that demanded attention or produced alarm. The quiet kind. The kind that existed at the edge of perception, in the space between what the eye saw and what the mind expected, the specific discrepancy that registered as discomfort rather than fact.

Xu Ran noticed first.

"Was that already like that?"

We had stopped — or I had stopped and he had stopped at his customary distance — in a section of forest that I had passed through the previous day. Or two days previous. The timeline was approximate. I had passed through and the forest had been forest and the trees had been trees and the specific arrangement of trunks and branches and canopy had been the standard arrangement that forests produced.

The tree: a pine. Old growth. The kind that had been here for a century or more and that had acquired the specific architecture of long-term survival — thick trunk, lateral branches weighted toward the south side where the light was strongest, the characteristic asymmetry that indicated decades of phototropic response.

Except the branches were wrong.

The lateral branches — the ones I remembered pointing south, or the ones I should have remembered pointing south, or the ones that I was now uncertain about because uncertainty was the specific quality of this wrongness — pointed east. Not dramatically east. Not perpendicular-to-where-they-should-be east. Slightly. The specific angle of deviation that was visible if you looked for it and invisible if you didn't and that occupied the exact gap between perception and confidence.

"You're seeing things," I said.

The words came out flat. Toneless. The specific delivery of a person whose vocal cords produced sound sometimes without the involvement of intention. I had spoken to him — the first voluntary sentence since his arrival, if this counted as voluntary, if the production of words to dismiss a perception counted as will or counted as reflex.

He wrote it down.

"I'm not," he said, to the notebook. "The branches. They were different yesterday."

"They're trees."

"Trees don't move."

"You've been in the forest too long."

He looked at me — the specific look of someone who had just heard the subject speak and who understood that the speaking was significant regardless of the content. I had spoken. Not a word. Not a syllable. A sentence. Two. The first extended vocalization since his arrival.

He did not comment on this. He wrote. Then he walked to the tree and examined the branch formations with the specific attention of a researcher documenting an anomaly. He touched the bark. Measured something — the distance from trunk to branch-tip, estimated with his hand.

"It could be nothing," he said.

It was nothing. Or it was something that was nothing to me because the category of things-that-mattered had emptied and the emptying was comprehensive and branch direction was not going to be the thing that refilled it.

"Trees grow," I said. "Branches shift. Wind. Weight. Snow."

"Not overnight."

I did not respond to that. The responding had exhausted its budget — two sentences, maybe three, the specific allocation that the disconnection permitted before the allocation ran out and the silence reasserted itself.

He photographed it. Not literally — he sketched. Quick, precise, the specific shorthand of someone who had developed notation systems for things that didn't fit standard categories. The tree. The branch angles. The cardinal directions. The date — he was tracking dates, keeping the temporal framework that I had abandoned.

"I'll check tomorrow," he said. "If the branches have moved again, it's not wind."

The branches would not have moved again. Or they would. The question occupied a category that I did not inhabit — the category of curiosity, of the desire to understand phenomena, of the specific motivation that drove Xu Ran's entire existence and that I had once possessed and that had disconnected when the disconnection happened.

We moved. Or I moved and he followed. The standard configuration — one body ahead, one body behind, ten paces of gradient between them. Through forest that was forest. Past trees that were trees. The specific normalcy that characterized the world when the world was behaving as the world should.

Except.

A shadow. Half an hour later. On the ground between two rocks. The specific shape of shadow that a tree produced when the sun was at a particular angle — the geometry of light and obstruction that followed physical laws and that should have been predictable and that was.

The shadow was wrong.

Not dramatically. The same quiet wrongness as the branches. The shadow fell in a direction that suggested the sun was at an angle that was not the angle the sun was at. A deviation. Small. Overreadable. Dismissable.

I dismissed it.

Xu Ran stopped. Looked at the shadow. Looked at the sun. Looked at the shadow again. Wrote.

"Did you — " he began.

"No."

"You didn't hear the question."

"The answer is no."

He wrote that down too. The exchange. Three lines in the notebook. The specific notation that said: subject spoke. Denied observation. Defensive? Or disinterested.

Disinterested. The accurate word. I was not denying the wrongness — I was failing to care about it. The branches, the shadow, the specific atmospheric oddities that Xu Ran detected and documented were data points in a category that required the expenditure of attention and the expenditure of attention required the kind of motivated engagement that the disconnection had severed.

But.

The shadow was wrong. I knew it was wrong the way I knew the branches were wrong — not through careful observation but through the specific passive awareness that thousands of years had installed, the background processing that detected anomalies without seeking them and that filed them without prioritizing them and that had filed this one in the category labeled: inconsistent.

Inconsistent with what, the filing system did not specify. Inconsistent with the physical laws that governed light and obstruction? Inconsistent with my memory of this location? Inconsistent with reality?

The category remained. Unfiled. Unprocessed. Present.

We walked.

Behind us: the tree with the wrong branches. The shadow with the wrong angle. The forest that was forest except in the specific details that were not forest.

Ahead: more forest. Predictable. Normal. The world as it should be.

Except perhaps not.

Xu Ran walked behind me, writing as he walked, the notebook open in front of him, the pen moving in the rhythm of someone documenting an environment that might not be behaving the way an environment should, and his documentation was the only acknowledgment that anything was different and the only acknowledgment was enough and the enough was already more than I wanted to notice.
