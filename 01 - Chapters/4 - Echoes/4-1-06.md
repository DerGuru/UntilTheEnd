# Chapter 6

The stream was the first water I'd encountered since the hut. Not because water was scarce — the terrain was webbed with it, small creeks, rainwater channels, the specific hydraulic network that mountain forests produced — but because the body hadn't sought it. The body walked and encountered things along the trajectory of walking, and the stream was on the trajectory.

I knelt at the bank because the body knelt. Because knees bent at the proximity of water with the automaticity of ten thousand years of kneeling at water and the automaticity was stronger than the disconnection.

The water was clear. Cold. Moving at the particular velocity that indicated shallow depth and moderate gradient and rock-bed. The kind of stream that in another context would have been pleasant. The kind that Wei would have —

No. That thought was not available. Or it was available but the connection between the thought and its destination — whatever the destination was supposed to produce — didn't complete. A cable reaching into noise. The frayed end.

I cupped water. Drank. Not from thirst — thirst had disconnected somewhere between the hut and here, along with the rest of the wanting — but from the mechanical sequence that proximity to water triggered.

The water was cold in my throat. Temperature: registered. Sensation: registered. The wiring between sensation and preference: absent. Cold water was the same as no water. Both were the same as everything.

At the bank, where my knees pressed into the mud, the grass was dying.

Not the dramatic death of the expanded pulse — the restrained, chronic death of sustained proximity. The continuous emission. The three-pace radius that was not an event but a condition, the baseline toxicity of a body that existed in a way that was incompatible with the small living things that surrounded it.

The grass browned. Slowly. The specific gradient of green to yellow to brown that would take days in drought but took minutes under the pressure of my proximity. My knees in the mud and the grass adjacent to my knees: yellowing. Curling inward. The tips: first. Then the blades. Then the root systems, dying below the surface where I couldn't see them but where they died regardless.

An ant colony — I could feel it. Below my right knee. The specific vibration of collective panic. The organisms: redirecting. Away from my knee, away from the dying grass, away from whatever frequency my body broadcast into the soil that produced the panic-response. The ants were leaving.

Everything was always leaving.

I stood. The bank where I'd knelt: a small rectangle of dead grass in the shape of two knees. A signature. A mark that said: someone toxic was here.

Walking. Through the forest. The continuous evidence.

A bird — above. The specific species that roosted in low branches and that made the territorial call that bounced between trees in the morning. It had been calling when I entered this section of forest. It stopped calling when I passed beneath its tree. Not because I was a predator — predators triggered different responses, flight responses, the sharp alarm-calls that rallied others. I triggered silence. The bird simply stopped. As if the frequency of its call had encountered interference.

I passed. The bird waited. Thirty paces behind me, it resumed.

A spider web. Strung between two trees at exactly the height that spanned the path. The spider: in the center, waiting. I walked through the web — not deliberately, not avoiding it, because avoiding things required preference and preference required will and will was the disconnected cable. The web broke against my face. The spider: falling. Landing on my sleeve. Scrambling. Then stopping. Then curling.

I flicked the dead spider off my sleeve with the specific gesture of someone removing debris. The specific gesture of someone for whom a dead spider was the same category as a leaf or a piece of bark — matter, matter on a surface, matter to be removed.

The forest was not empty. The forest was full and the fullness was the problem. Every full thing near me became less full. Every living thing near me accelerated toward the thing that living things accelerated toward eventually — the thing I did not accelerate toward.

I was the desert.

Not the geological formation — not the sand and wind and the specific climate conditions that produced landscapes without water. The other kind. The kind that walked. The kind that carried its aridity with it, that turned the world arid upon contact, that existed as the mobile center of a death-radius that went wherever the body went and the body went wherever the trajectory took it.

A desert that breathed.

The realization was not new. The three-pace circle had been evident since the night at the tree root — the oak, the first night, the ants diverting. But the realization had been observation then. Data. The specific cataloguing of a phenomenon that was interesting the way phenomena are interesting when the observer lacks the capacity to be disturbed.

Now it was different. Now the question was inside the data and the question changed the data from observation to indictment and the indictment was: this radius extends to everything near me. This radius kills what is near me. Wei was near me.

Did I kill him?

Not directly. Not with hands. Not with intent. But with the specific proximity that was the condition for death in small things — did that proximity, sustained over months, years, erode the thing that kept him alive? Did the radius work on him the way it worked on the beetle, the grass, the spider — slowly, chronically, the cell-level degradation that reduced structural integrity until the structure failed?

His core was already damaged. Before the sect, before the fight, before all of it. His core was cracked and the crack was the vulnerability and the vulnerability was there and I was there and my presence — my specific, toxic, death-producing presence — was I the thing that turned the crack into a fracture and the fracture into collapse?

No data. No way to test. No way to confirm or deny. The thought existed in the category of things that were possible and unprovable and the combination — possible but unprovable — was the combination that produced the most persistent form of guilt.

The stream continued behind me. Still flowing. The water: unaffected. The bank where I'd knelt: dead.

Water moved through me the way everything moved through me — the food I didn't eat, the sleep I didn't sleep, the grief I felt and couldn't use. It entered and it left and it changed nothing and the nothing was the condition and the condition was: I was here. I was a desert. I breathed.

The forest diminished in my wake and ahead of me it was full and alive and waiting to be less.
