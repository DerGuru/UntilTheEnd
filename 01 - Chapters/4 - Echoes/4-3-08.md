# Chapter 25

Night. Camp. The specific arrangement that repetition had refined into ritual: his fire, his pot, his notebook, his meditation, his sleep. My distance, my stillness, my open eyes, my humming.

Except tonight the humming was louder.

Not louder in the audible sense — I could not hear it. The humming existed below hearing, in the specific frequency range that the body perceived as vibration rather than sound. But the vibration was more intense. The specific increase in amplitude that indicated the qi's autonomous cycling had accelerated, that the system was operating at higher capacity, that whatever power source drove the cycling was outputting more.

Xu Ran slept. His breathing: even. The specific rhythm that indicated the deep-sleep phase, the interval during which external stimuli required greater intensity to produce wakefulness. He was deeply asleep. His notebook: beside him. His hand: on the notebook. Even in sleep, the contact with the record was maintained.

The humming intensified.

I stood. The movement was not voluntary in the standard sense — not decided, not chosen, not the product of the deliberative process that will-based action required. The movement was responsive. The humming intensified and the body stood and the standing was the body's response to the intensification and the response was: I need to be upright for this.

I walked three paces from camp. Into the dark. Into the space beyond the fire's embers, beyond the area that Xu Ran's proximity had defined as camp.

The humming followed.

Not followed — continued. Following implied the humming was external and the external was trailing the body like a sound source trailing a listener. The humming was not external. The humming was internal. The humming was the chest and the core and the qi and the thing that all of those things together constituted and the thing was: me.

I was the humming. The humming was me. The distinction between the body and the vibration had dissolved — not suddenly, not in a moment of revelation, but gradually, over the weeks that the humming had been present, over the interval from the oak root to the clearing to the hut to here. The humming had started as a phenomenon observed by a body. Now the humming was the body's baseline state. The body and the humming were the same system.

I walked further. Five paces from camp. The dark was complete — no moon, cloud cover, the specific absence of light that mountain terrain produced on overcast nights. I walked into the dark and the humming walked into the dark and the dark was the condition and the humming was the condition and both conditions were mine.

The qi pulsed.

Not the involuntary jolt that the question or the memory or the frustration had produced — those were reactions, specific responses to specific stimuli, the emotional system colliding with the qi system and the collision producing discharge. This was different. This was the system operating on its own schedule. The pulse was autonomous.

Like a heartbeat.

The qi pulsed the way the heart beat — not because I told it to, not because an event demanded it, but because the system's internal rhythm had reached the point in its cycle where the pulse was the next event. Regular. Rhythmic. The specific periodicity that indicated an autonomous function, a system that ran itself, that maintained itself, that did whatever it did regardless of the consciousness's participation.

The pulse radiated outward. Three paces — the standard radius. But the pulse extended beyond the standard radius. Five paces. Seven. The specific expansion that indicated the system was testing its range, the way a sleeping animal stretched its limbs — not purposefully, but as part of the cycle of rest and extension that autonomous systems performed.

The grass at seven paces: trembled. Not died — trembled. The specific vibration that vegetation performed when exposed to a pressure wave that was below the lethal threshold but above the perceptible threshold. The grass felt the pulse. The grass responded.

I watched the grass tremble at seven paces and the watching was the specific observation of someone who understood that the thing being observed was not external. The grass was trembling because of me. The pulse was from me. The system was mine.

And the system was running a program I had not written.

The pulse returned. Contracted. Seven paces back to three. The standard radius reasserted itself. The expansion: over. The testing: complete. The system: satisfied — if a system could be satisfied, if the autonomous function had a state that corresponded to the cessation of need.

I stood in the dark. Three paces of dead grass around me, unchanging, the standard. Beyond three paces: trembling grass, recovering, the evidence of the pulse. Beyond seven paces: untouched grass, unaffected, the world that my system had not yet reached.

The humming continued. The specific vibration that was the qi cycling in its autonomous pattern, the pattern that I did not control, the pattern that controlled itself, the pattern that was expanding its repertoire from passive cycling to active pulsing.

Something in me was running.

Something in me had its own program, its own schedule, its own objectives. Something in me was not waiting for my participation. Something in me operated the way the heartbeat operated — autonomously, continuously, without the option of refusal.

I walked back to camp. Three paces from where Xu Ran slept. His hand on the notebook. His breathing: uninterrupted. He had not felt the pulse. Or he had felt it and had slept through it. Or the pulse had not reached his distance, his ten paces, his safe zone.

I sat. On the brown grass. In my radius. In my humming.

The humming was a second breathing. A parallel respiration. The specific sensation of being occupied by a process that was not my process but that used my body as its medium and my body as its instrument and my body as the thing through which it expressed itself into the world.

The title of this epoch — if epochs had titles, if the period of existence that I was currently inhabiting could be labeled the way historians labeled eras — was: echoes. The humming was an echo. The pulsing was an echo. The retroactive paths were echoes. Everything that was happening was the reverberation of something that had happened before, or that was happening elsewhere, or that was happening inside me in a register I could not access.

Echoes of what, I did not know. The what was the question. The question was larger than the ones I had carried so far — larger than why-not-him, larger than what-protects-me, larger than the specific inquiries that grief and guilt had generated. This question was:

What am I?

The question did not produce an answer. The question produced the humming. The humming produced the question. The loop was closed and the loop was autonomous and the loop was running and the running was the condition and the condition was: me. Standing in the dark. Three paces of dead grass. Something breathing through me that was not my breath.

Dawn came. Light changed. Xu Ran woke.

I was sitting where I had been. His hand left the notebook. His eyes opened.

"The grass," he said. Looking at the seven-pace circle. The trembling, recovering grass beyond the standard radius. The evidence.

"It pulsed," I said.

He opened the notebook. He wrote.

The humming continued. Under everything. Between everything. Through everything. The echo that was becoming the voice.
