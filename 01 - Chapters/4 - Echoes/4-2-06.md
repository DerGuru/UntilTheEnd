# Chapter 13

He cooked.

This was the surprising thing — not that he cooked, because cooking was a survival skill that anyone who traveled would develop, but that he cooked well. With the specific competence that indicated practice beyond necessity, the kind of cooking that emerged from someone who had decided that food was not just fuel but also the closest approximation of control available in an uncontrollable world.

Rice. Vegetables foraged from the surrounding forest — the specific selection that indicated botanical knowledge, the ability to distinguish edible from toxic, desirable from tolerable. Something with ginger root. The ginger was unexpected — he carried it, apparently, the way other travelers carried weapons or talismans. Ginger root, in a pouch, wrapped in cloth.

The fire was small. Efficient. He maintained it with the specific attention of someone who understood the relationship between heat distribution and cooking outcome and who took both seriously. The pot — a single pot, scratched, dented, the specific deterioration of a vessel that had been used daily for months — sat on stones arranged to direct heat upward.

The smell reached me at eight paces. Before the radius. Inside the green zone. The specific aromatic combination of rice steam and ginger and the volatile compounds that heated vegetables released and the combination was: food. The olfactory category that the body filed as food.

I did not eat.

I sat.

This was new. Not the sitting — I sat and stood and walked in patterns that the body determined without input from the will. The sitting-nearby-while-food-was-prepared was new. The specific proximity to a cooking fire and a cooking person that indicated — not hunger. Not desire. The shadow of a pattern. The ghost of a habit. The specific posture of someone who had, in other centuries, in other lifetimes, sat near fires while food was prepared. The body remembered the posture. The body assumed the posture. The will was not consulted.

I sat six paces from the fire. At the edge of the transition zone. The gradient: green grass (his side), yellow grass (between), brown grass (mine). Six paces of ecological commentary on my proximity.

He noticed. He did not look up. The specific discipline of someone who had learned not to acknowledge behavioral changes in the subject because acknowledgment could disrupt the behavior and the behavior was data and the data was: she sat.

He stirred the pot. Added something — salt, from a smaller pouch. The salt dissolved. The steam changed quality. The smell deepened.

"You're staring."

His voice was level. Directed at the pot. The specific delivery of someone who was reporting an observation without making eye contact, the tactical communication of a person who understood that direct address could terminate the interaction.

I was staring. Not deliberately — staring was the default state of eyes that were open and that faced something and that had no directive to look elsewhere. The fire was in front of me. The pot was on the fire. He was next to the pot. The visual field contained: fire, pot, person, steam.

"I'm evaluating," I said.

The words surprised me. Not their content — evaluating was accurate, or as accurate as any word could be for the thing the disconnected mind did when it observed a process without having a stake in the process's outcome. The surprise was the production. The vocalization. The specific deployment of throat muscles and breath that constituted speech and that I had not deployed voluntarily since the tree-branch exchange.

"And?" he said. Still to the pot.

Silence.

He waited. Three seconds. Five. The specific interval that followed a semi-question and that indicated openness to a response and that closed naturally when no response came. The interval closed.

He served himself. A bowl — the same scratched, dented aesthetic as the pot, the specific matching deterioration of a set that had been carried together for months. He ate with the focused efficiency of someone who treated meals as scheduled events rather than optional activities.

He did not serve me. He did not offer. He did not set food at the transition zone with the expectant generosity of someone hoping the offering would be accepted. He cooked for himself. He ate for himself. The cooking was his and the eating was his and the not-sharing was a form of respect that I recognized intellectually without being able to appreciate emotionally.

He was not performing generosity. He was not trying to feed me back to life. He was eating dinner.

The distinction mattered. The distinction was the thing that separated him from the category of people-who-tried-to-help and placed him in the category of people-who-existed-nearby. The first category produced the specific anxiety of obligation — the awareness that someone was investing effort that would be wasted. The second category produced: nothing. Xu Ran eating dinner beside a fire that I sat near was the same as rain falling on a roof I happened to be under. Coincidental proximity. No transaction.

Something — small, internal, in the specific region below the disconnection — relaxed a fraction. Not enough to constitute a change. Enough to constitute a variation. The difference between absolute zero and one degree above absolute zero: technically warmer. Technically changed. Functionally identical.

But the measurement existed.

He finished. Cleaned the bowl with grass and sand — the specific field-cleaning method of a traveler with no access to soap. Packed the pot. The ginger pouch: rewrapped, restored to its position in his pack. The fire: allowed to diminish. The entire process performed with the specific routine of someone whose evening followed the same structure every evening and whose structure was the thing that kept the evenings from becoming silence.

She sat.

I knew he would write this. I knew the notebook would receive the datum — subject sat near cooking fire. Duration: seventeen minutes. Distance: six paces. Consumed: nothing. But she sat.

He wrote it. The pen in the firelight. The miniature letters.

I sat until the fire was embers. Then I stood. Then I walked to my standard distance — the clearing edge, the brown-grass zone, the specific location that maximum separation from another human being provided within the geography of camp.

He did not watch me go. Or he watched from the corner of his eye, the specific peripheral observation that characterized someone who had learned that some data was best collected indirectly. He watched or he didn't.

The almost-smile.

Not a smile. Not even the beginning of a smile. The specific micro-expression that preceded the facial configuration of amusement and that could be suppressed before it became visible and that I suppressed and that the suppression was itself the data — the fact that there was something to suppress. The fact that his comment and my response and the not-eating and the sitting-nearby had produced, somewhere in the functional emotional system, the specific impulse that in another context and another century would have been: humor.

It was not humor. It was the echo of humor. The vibration of a string that had been played in a different room.

But the string existed.
