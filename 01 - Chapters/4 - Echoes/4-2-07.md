# Chapter 14

He meditated at night.

This was not unusual — cultivators meditated, the way farmers planted and scholars read, the specific professional activity that defined the category. What was unusual was the volume.

It began with breathing. The specific respiratory pattern that meditation required — deep, rhythmic, the controlled inhalation and exhalation that directed qi through pathways and that most cultivators performed in silence, in the internal space, in the private architecture of their cultivation framework.

Xu Ran breathed loudly.

Not the loudness of effort — not the heavy breathing of exertion or the labored breathing of impaired capacity. The deliberate loudness of someone whose breathing was engineered to be heard. Each inhalation: audible at ten paces. Each exhalation: more so. The specific hiss of air through partially closed lips that amplified the sound and that directed the sound outward rather than inward and that seemed designed to fill the space with the evidence of his metabolic activity.

Then the mantras.

Murmured. Not the whispered mantras of someone reciting privately but the half-voiced mantras of someone whose recitation inhabited the space between speech and thought and who had decided that space was an audible space. Words — or approximations of words. The specific syllables that cultivation traditions used to focus intention and that were typically internal and that Xu Ran performed externally, in the audio range, with the consistency of someone whose tradition was loud or whose choice was loud or whose need was loud.

The mantras had a tune. Not a melody — a contour. The specific rise and fall that indicated that the recitation was not purely functional but partially musical, the chanting of someone who had at some point decided that chanting was the form and that the form was non-negotiable.

He hummed between mantras. The humming was the thing that connected one set of syllables to the next, the bridge between phrases, the continuous output of sound that filled the intervals and that ensured that no interval was silent.

No interval was silent.

I stood at my standard distance. Brown grass. Stars. The specific nighttime conditions that had characterized every night since the forest and the hut and the walking and the stopping. But now: sound. Continuous, unavoidable, the specific acoustic intrusion that Xu Ran's meditation produced in the shared space.

It was — the detection required precision here, because the disconnection normally filtered such categorizations — irritating.

Irritating was a category. Irritating required the detection of preference — the preference for silence over noise, the preference for one state over another, the preference that meant: I want this to be different. The disconnection should have prevented irritating. The disconnection should have rendered his meditation the same as silence, the same as birdsong, the same as wind.

It didn't. The meditation was irritating. The specific irritation of sound that could not be ignored because the sound was designed to be unable to be ignored.

"Can you do that quieter?"

The words came out before the disconnection could intercept them. Three words. The specific count that constituted a request — subject, verb, object. Simple. Direct. Produced by an irritation that had navigated the disconnection the way water navigated a dam that had a crack in it.

He stopped. Mid-mantra. Mid-hum. The silence that followed was absolute — the specific silence that occurred when a continuous sound ceased and the cessation was as audible as the sound had been.

"No," he said.

He resumed. The humming. The mantras. The breathing. The specific acoustic program that constituted his nightly meditation and that constituted, apparently, an immovable feature of his presence.

I stood. In the noise.

The noise was not random. The noise was not careless. The noise was — I understood this now, or the understanding surfaced from below the disconnection where the analytical faculties still operated — intentional. Xu Ran meditated loudly because Xu Ran needed to meditate loudly. Because silence was the thing he feared. Because silence was Vergessen — forgetting. Because the broken core and the compulsive notation and the loud meditation were all the same behavior expressed through different channels: the continuous production of evidence that he existed, that his observations existed, that the world was being recorded and that the recording was happening and that the happening was audible and that the audible was proof.

Silence = disappearance. Noise = survival.

He was afraid of the thing I was becoming.

This observation — clinical, distant, the specific quality of an observation produced by an analytical system that operated independently of the emotional system — was the first observation I had made about Xu Ran that extended beyond his annoying and into what his annoying meant.

He was broken. Not the way I was broken — not the disconnection, not the abgeklemmt, not the specific subtraction of will from body. He was broken in the complementary way. The way that feared subtraction and that fought it with addition — adding sound, adding notes, adding the continuous documentation of everything he perceived because the perception was ephemeral and the ephemeral was the enemy and the enemy was silence.

We were the same problem expressed in opposite directions. I was silence that produced death. He was noise that fought forgetting.

He continued. The mantras rose and fell. The humming bridged the gaps. His breathing filled the space between the humming and the mantras and the space was filled and the filling was the thing he needed and the thing I had to endure and the enduring was — 

I was enduring.

I was experiencing irritation and categorizing it and responding to it verbally and now enduring it and the enduring was an act and acts required engagement and engagement required — not will. Something adjacent. Something close enough to will that the distinction was academic.

He had made me say three words. He had made me experience irritation. He had made me endure. In the hierarchy of reconnection — if such a hierarchy existed — these were small movements. Negligible. The difference between absolute zero and two degrees above. Three degrees.

But the temperature was rising.

He would not know this. Or he would know it eventually, from his notebook, from the data he accumulated nightly in the miniature handwriting, from the trend-line that plotted my word-count and my proximity and my responses over time and that would, eventually, show an upward slope. He would know it because knowing was the thing he did and doing was the thing that kept him alive.

He meditated loudly until the stars shifted to the positions that indicated midnight. Then he stopped. Then he slept. The sleeping was silent — the specific irony that his waking was designed to prevent silence and his sleeping was the silence he feared and the fear was manageable because sleeping was temporary and waking was long and waking was loud.

I stood. In the returned silence. In the contrast.

The silence was different after noise. The silence that followed sound was not the same silence that existed in the absence of sound. It was the silence that remembered sound. The silence that had been interrupted and that had re-formed around the interruption and that bore the shape of it.

Silence with a Xu-Ran-shaped hole in it.

I stood until morning. Eyes open. The humming in my chest — the internal vibration, the qi cycling — continued its low frequency. An octave below his meditation. A counterpoint that no one heard because no one was supposed to hear it.

Morning came. He woke. He opened the notebook.

He wrote.
