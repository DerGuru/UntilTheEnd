# Chapter 1

Forest. Silence.

Not the silence of absence — the silence of exclusion. The forest had sound: wind in canopy, water over stone somewhere to the west, the fundamental hum of biological operation that living systems produced by existing. The forest had all of this. It had it over there, and there, and beyond there. Not here.

Here was the circle.

Three meters. Precisely three. A perimeter of brown — dead grass, dried leaves, the specific coloration of plant matter that had been alive and was no longer alive and whose no-longer-alive-ness was a radius and the radius was mine.

I sat on the exposed root of an oak. Old tree. The kind whose age was measured in the specific vocabulary of organisms that had outlived their context — centuries, not years. Its bark: thick, ridged, the armor of something that had survived by not moving. My back against the trunk. My hands on my knees. My eyes: open.

The brown circle extended from my position in every direction. Dead grass. Brittle. The specific texture of vegetation that had lost its water not through drought but through proximity — to me, to whatever I emitted, to the condition that I was.

At the edge of the circle: an ant trail. A line of organized insects moving from somewhere to somewhere else, the specific logistics of colony operation that ants performed without supervision. The trail ran west-northwest, direct, purposeful. Until it reached my radius.

It bent. The ants — each one, individually, without conference or discussion — turned. Not gradually. Abruptly. As if encountering a wall. They continued parallel to the edge, rebuilding their path around the obstruction, and the obstruction was: the air around me. Not a wall. Not a barrier. An absence of the conditions that living things required to continue in a straight line.

They diverted. And the diversion was the boundary. And the boundary was me.

I had been sitting here. How long — the duration was not available. Time required markers: sunrise, sunset, meals, sleep, the sequential events that converted the continuous experience of existing into the discrete experience of living. I had none of these. The sun had moved. That was information. It was not time.

I did not eat. Not refusal — the distinction was the thing. Refusal required the awareness of the refused. A berry existed on a branch within arm's reach — red, ripe, the specific offering that forests made to creatures that consumed. My hand did not move toward it. Not because I chose not to eat. Because eating did not occur. The berry did not register in the system that converted environmental data into action. It was there. I was here. These were separate facts that did not interact.

I did not sleep. Not insomnia — the distinction again. Insomnia was the desire to sleep frustrated by the inability. I had no desire. The eyes stayed open because closing them was an action and actions required the impulse that preceded them and the impulse was absent. The system that converted "night" into "close eyes" had disconnected. Not broken — disconnected. As if someone had pulled the cable between stimulus and response and the pulling had been clean and the clean was the absence and the absence was: I sat with open eyes and the eyes saw and the seeing was data and data was not experience.

Overhead: a bird. Moving through the canopy. Its trajectory: across my position, from east to west. It did not land. It adjusted — mid-flight, the specific banking of wings that course-correction produced when course-correction was instinctive. It flew over me and the over was the choice and the choice was: not here. Not near this.

Even the air. Thinner. The specific atmospheric quality of a space that contained something that displaced habitability — not visibly, not dramatically, but in the register that living systems detected and that detection converted into: elsewhere.

I sat.

Hands on knees. Back against oak. Eyes open. The circle of brown extending from my position like a fact.

A shift in the light. The angle of sun through canopy changing by degrees that indicated late afternoon or early evening or the passage of hours that I had not counted because counting was the function of a system that was disconnected and the disconnection was the condition and the condition was the state and the state was: this.

I sat.

Something — a sound. Distant. The crack of a branch under weight. An animal, probably. Large enough to produce audible branch-failure. Moving through the forest at a distance that was outside my radius and therefore inside the world and the world was the thing that continued around the circle that was me.

I did not react. The sound arrived. The sound departed. Between the arriving and the departing: nothing. No thought, no assessment, no the-body-preparing-for-possible-threat. The system that converted sound into response: disconnected. Like the others. Clean cable, pulled.

I sat.

The oak held me. The root supported. The bark pressed against my back and the pressing was pressure and pressure was data and data was. And was was everything. And everything was the circle with the ants at the edge and the brown grass and the bird that didn't land and the berry that didn't register.

And I sat.
