# Chapter 22

The blood tasted like copper. The memory tasted like distance.

The metallic flavor was in my mouth because the sleeve-wound had sent a fine spray that reached my lips — the specific trajectory of arterial expression that occurred when a blade caught the upper arm at the correct angle. The blood was mine and the taste was the trigger and the trigger connected to the system and the system produced:

Memory.

Two thousand years. Or close to it — the approximation that all deep memories carried, the specific imprecision that the passage of centuries imposed on the timestamps of experience. Two thousand years, give or take the lifespan of a civilization.

A warrior. In a province that no longer existed under any name. In a conflict that no longer existed in any record. The specific kind of war that consumed a region for a generation and that was forgotten within three because the next war was already happening and wars replaced each other the way seasons did.

He was blind.

This was the detail that survived when most details hadn't. Blind — the specific condition of eyes that did not receive light, that had ceased to function either from birth or from damage, the distinction irrelevant because the result was the same. He fought without seeing. He fought with the specific compensatory awareness that blindness produced in organisms that were otherwise functional — hearing, spatial memory, the particular sensitivity to air movement that told him where bodies were without seeing them.

He hit me.

The only swordstroke in two thousand years that I hadn't seen coming. Not because I was slow — because he was different. Because his attack came from a vector that vision-dependent organisms did not anticipate, from an angle that existed in the perceptual framework of someone who navigated the world without the primary sense that everyone else relied on. He cut where sighted fighters didn't cut. He moved where sighted fighters didn't move. And he hit me.

My left side. Below the ribs. The specific location that a sighted fighter would have avoided because it was too difficult to reach from standard combat positions and because the risk-reward calculation of such a deep lateral approach was unfavorable. For him — blind, navigating by sound, by the displacement of air, by the vibration of the ground beneath his feet — the approach was natural. It was where his perceptual system told him the opening was.

Blood. Mine. The same copper taste that was in my mouth now, millennia later, in a clearing with two unconscious spirit-beasts and two disabled bandits and a researcher with a notebook.

The wound healed. Then too — the same involuntary closure that characterized every wound I received. But I remembered the moment before it closed. The specific instant when the pain was present and the pain was: connection. The momentary bridge between my body and the acknowledgment that my body existed in a world that could touch it, that could reach through the specific armor of immortality and make contact.

Pain as contact. The substitute for touch. The replacement for the thing that living people experienced through interactions with other living people and that I experienced through the intervention of sharpened steel.

The blind warrior died three days later. In the same conflict. Killed by someone less interesting. The specific mundane death that warriors experienced when the war was large enough and the probability caught up and the probability was: in a conflict of this scale, everyone dies except her.

I remembered his face. Scarred — the specific pattern of facial scarring that indicated a life of combat that predated the blindness or that coincided with it. He had fought his entire life and his entire life had been approximately forty years and forty years was the specific interval that constituted a lifetime for organisms that experienced lifetimes in the standard configuration.

I had watched him die. From a distance. The specific distance that I maintained from events that I had decided were not my concern — the distance that was close enough to observe and far enough to not intervene and the gap between observing and intervening was the space that I inhabited and the space was wide.

The memory closed. The copper faded. The blood on my arm dried in the specific pattern that drying blood produced on skin.

Xu Ran watched me from ten paces. He had been watching throughout — the blank gaze, the specific unfocused attention that indicated internal processing, the visible signs of someone whose consciousness was elsewhere while the body remained here. He recognized memory-states. He had learned to.

He wrote. Then he spoke.

"How often," he said, "have you done that?"

"Done what."

"Let something hit you."

The question was specific. The question was the analytical precision that characterized his approach — not how-do-you-feel, not are-you-okay, but the operational question that treated the behavior as data rather than trauma.

"Enough," I said.

He wrote the answer. Then he put the notebook down. Put it down — the specific gesture that indicated a shift from professional to personal, from documenter to person, the rare transition that occurred when the data exceeded the emotional capacity of the data-collector.

"The spiraling," he said. "You know you're spiraling."

I did not answer. The spiraling — if that was the word — was the specific escalation that the recklessness followed: from letting a wolf-beast approach, to walking toward cultivators, to allowing a blade past the guard. The trajectory was clear. The trajectory pointed toward the thing that the trajectory pointed toward and the thing was: more. More contact. More pain. More of the only real thing available.

"I'm not going to tell you to stop," he said. "But I'm going to write what I see."

"You always write what you see."

"Yes. And what I see is someone who is testing how much damage she can feel before the feeling stops."

The accuracy was uncomfortable. Not because it was wrong — because it was the kind of right that required the observer to have understood the subject at a level that the subject preferred not to be understood at.

That evening, I cooked.

Not well. Not with any of the competence that Xu Ran brought to the task or any of the accumulated knowledge that millennia should have provided. I cooked because the body performed the action the way it performed all actions — from the muscle memory of previous iterations, from the stored patterns of other centuries when cooking had been the evening activity and the evening activity had been performed.

The rice burned. The vegetables disintegrated. The ginger — his ginger, borrowed without asking — was cut too thin and dissolved into the water and the water was too hot and the heat destroyed the volatile compounds that made ginger ginger.

He said nothing.

I said nothing.

We both knew.

The meal was inedible. I did not eat it — not from the disconnection's appetite suppression but from the specific recognition that the product was not food. He did not eat it — from the same recognition, expressed through the diplomatic silence that constituted his commentary.

He cooked a second meal. Quietly. The ginger: proper thickness. The heat: proper distribution. The meal: edible.

I sat six paces away and watched him cook the replacement for my failure and the watching was the specific observation of someone who recognized that the failure was significant not because the food was bad but because the attempt had been made and the attempt was the first voluntary domestic action since the forest and the voluntary-ness was the data and the data was: she tried.

He wrote it down. Of course he did.
