# Chapter 26

The cliff existed because the mountain ended.

Not gradually — not the diminishing slope that mountain faces typically performed, the geological courtesy of terrain transitioning from vertical to diagonal to horizontal. This mountain ended. The specific geological event that occurred when a fault line created a sheer face and erosion did not smooth it and the not-smoothing produced a wall that dropped from the top to the bottom without the intermediary stages that most geology included.

Eight hundred meters. I estimated this from the visual data — the size of the rocks below, the scale of the sparse vegetation at the bottom, the specific proportional calculations that experience with geography produced. Eight hundred meters of air between where I stood and where the ground resumed.

Below: rock. Flat, grey, the specific kind of stone that shattered other things that encountered it at velocity. No water. No scrub. No interventional surface that might convert vertical motion into something less terminal. Rock. The honest kind. The kind that made no promises about what would happen upon contact.

I stood at the edge.

This was not planned. Not in the sense that plans were formulated — the deliberative process, the weighing of options, the assessment of outcomes. The edge was where the path led and the path was the thing I walked and the walking brought me here and here was the edge and the edge was eight hundred meters of vertical nothing above flat grey rock.

My toes — the front third of my feet — extended past the edge. The specific deployment of balance that allowed a body to stand at an edge without falling was automatic, the proprioceptive calibration that the body performed without conscious input. The toes knew the edge. The toes held.

Wind. There had been wind — the specific mountain-edge wind that updrafts produced, the consistent horizontal pressure that operating at this altitude meant. The wind had been present during the approach, during the last hundred meters of the path that led here, during the specific interval in which the terrain announced what it was about to do by becoming thinner and more exposed.

The wind stopped.

The stopping was not gradual — not a diminishing, not a fade. A cessation. The air that had been moving was no longer moving and the no-longer-moving was absolute and the absolute was the silence that resulted when the medium for sound transmission went still.

Silence.

Not the silence of the forest — not the chronic, background silence that my presence produced in living things. This silence was atmospheric. This silence was the world pausing. The specific absence of sound that occurred when every source of sound — wind, insects, birds, the specific background hum that the atmosphere itself produced — went simultaneously quiet.

My own breathing was the only sound. In the silence, my breathing was: loud. Too loud. The specific amplification that occurred when all competing sounds ceased and the residual sounds — involuntary, biological, the sounds that the body produced by existing — became prominent. My breath sounded foreign. My breath sounded like someone else's breath heard from close proximity. My breath sounded like the thing it was: the respiration of an organism that was standing at the edge of eight hundred meters of nothing.

I looked down.

The looking was not vertiginous. Not fear-producing. Not the specific biological alarm that heights triggered in organisms whose evolutionary history included falling-as-threat. I looked down the way one looked down from any elevation — with the spatial awareness that distance provided and the distance in this case was eight hundred meters and the awareness was: that is a long way to fall.

Xu Ran was not here. Behind me — at the camp, or on the path, or in the specific elsewhere that his trajectory occupied when his trajectory diverged from mine. He was not at the cliff's edge. He would not see me standing here with my toes past the edge and the silence around me and the rock below.

Or he would. Later. The timeline was not my concern. The timeline was the thing that happened to things that existed in time and I existed in time and the cliff existed in time and the eight hundred meters existed in time and the relationship between all of these temporal things would produce whatever it produced.

I looked down at the rock. Eight hundred meters. Grey. Patient. The specific patience of stone that waited because waiting was all stone could do and stone was good at it.

The silence held. My breathing continued. The world was a held breath and I was standing on the edge of the breath and the edge was the place where the breath could be released.

I stood.
