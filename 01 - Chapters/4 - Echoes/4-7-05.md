# Chapter 55

The destroyed clearing was behind us by three days and seventeen rest-stops when I turned back.

Not physically. Physically we continued forward — the slow, rib-governed pace that Xu Ran's healing imposed on the trajectory. Physically the clearing receded, step by careful step, into the distance that the walking produced.

I turned back in my attention. In the specific cognitive direction that attention adopted when the present was stable enough to release the mind toward the past. The present was stable: walk, pause, eat, walk, sleep, walk. The repetition had produced the stability. And the stability had released the attention. And the attention went: back.

To the destroyed clearing. To the circle of snapped trees and fissured ground. To the place where the shockwave had detonated from her body and the devastation had radiated outward and the man who now limped beside her had been crumpled like paper by the force that she produced.

I stopped walking.

Xu Ran stopped. Three paces ahead. He turned — carefully, the rotation limited by the ribs. He looked at me.

"I want to go back," I said.

He said nothing. The specific silence that was his method of inviting elaboration without demanding it.

"Not to the clearing. To where it started."

He waited.

"The origin." I touched my sternum. The specific gesture that indicated: here. Inside. The place where the thing-below-qi resided, where the substrate operated, where the shockwave was manufactured. "I need to go inward."

He understood. I saw the understanding arrive — the specific facial transition from waiting to comprehension. He understood what she meant. Not physical return. Not geographical. The inward direction. The *Rein* that had been the compass bearing since the cliff.

But before the inward turn, I needed the outward reckoning.

"The clearing," I said. "I want to see it one more time."

We went back. The three days' walking became five — his pace had not improved, the ribs healing at the mortal speed that mortal bodies demanded. We walked back through the forest, through the path we had already taken, through the specific retracing that constituted: return.

The clearing was unchanged. The destruction was: persistent. The snapped trees. The fissured ground. The circle — thirty meters, precise, the radius of her protection's overflow. Nothing had grown in the days since the event. The devastation was fresh enough to maintain its specificity.

I stood at the center. Where I had stood when I drank the poison. Where the shockwave had originated. The exact spot.

I looked at it.

The fallen trees radiated outward from my position like the petals of a flower that had been pressed flat. The fissures in the ground followed the same radial pattern. Everything pointed away from where she stood. Everything said: this is where the force originated. This is where the center was.

She was the center.

Wind moved through the downed trees. The specific sound of air passing through forest that was no longer standing — lower than the canopy-wind, more intimate, the whisper of air through snapped branches and cracked trunks. The sound of aftermath.

The smell of ash was present. Three days old. The specific olfactory signature of wood-ash and charred earth and the remnant combustion products that the shockwave's heat had produced.

The smell triggered it.

Ash. The smell of ash. The sensory channel opening — the Andock-Regel engaging, the specific connection between present sensation and past experience that the memory system required to produce: recall.

Wei had said it once. In a morning that smelled like this — like ash, like the aftermath of something that had burned. A campfire. A cooking fire. The specific domestic context that Wei inhabited when he was not dying.

He had said: "If you don't know where to go, just go."

The memory was short. Four sentences. The shortest recall in the entire book. The image: Wei's back. He was walking ahead of her. The morning was grey. He did not look back when he said it, because the saying was not for her approval — the saying was: a principle. An operating guideline. The specific Wei directive that governed ambiguity: if you don't know, go. If you're uncertain, move. If the destination is unclear, the motion is still valid.

If you don't know where to go, just go.

So I went. He had been right. He was always right, the dead boy with the simple principles and the walking-ahead of her into mornings that smelled like ash.

I turned away from the clearing. The specific physical action of concluding: the looking was done. The reckoning was complete. Not closed — complete. She had seen what she had done. She had stood at the center of her own destructive radius. She had understood the geography of her danger.

And then she had remembered the directive. The Wei-directive. The four-sentence compass.

Just go.

The clearing stayed behind. The trees stayed down. The fissures stayed open. The circle of her destruction stayed exactly as she had made it — a monument to the thing inside her that protected her at any cost.

She did not look back a second time. Looking once was: enough.

Xu Ran fell in behind her. Three paces. His ribs. His limp. His breathing careful and shallow and measured. He followed.

And they went.
