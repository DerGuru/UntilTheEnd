# Chapter 36

"Why are we here?"

The question was genuine. Not performative — not the question of someone who knew the answer and was testing whether the other person also knew it. Genuine. The question of someone standing at the rim of a four-hundred-year-old volcanic crater who did not know why she was standing at the rim of a four-hundred-year-old volcanic crater.

Xu Ran's pen stopped.

The stopping was the first indicator. Xu Ran's pen did not stop. Xu Ran's pen moved the way his lungs moved — continuously, involuntarily, as a condition of being Xu Ran. The pen stopped and the stopping was the silence that occurred when a mechanism encountered input that disrupted its function.

"You know why we're here," he said. Carefully. The specific carefulness of someone selecting words the way a surgeon selected instruments — with precision, with awareness that the wrong selection could cause damage.

"I don't."

I said this with the specific certainty that characterized statements from the functional cognitive system — not the disconnection's flatness, not the emotional system's interference. The cognitive system: engaged, operational, reporting. I did not know why we were at this crater. The not-knowing was not confusion. The not-knowing was: absence. The specific absence of information that should have been present and was not.

Xu Ran opened his notebook. The specific gesture that in another context would have been routine — the consulting of notes, the referencing of documentation. In this context: evidence. He was about to show me evidence of something I had done and said and that I did not remember doing or saying.

"Read this," he said.

The page: his handwriting. Miniature. Careful. The specific notation that he had developed for documenting our interactions. Date. Location. Observation. And then: her words.

*"The stone vibrated." — Yun, crater center, hand on basalt.*

Four words. Attributed to me. In his handwriting. On the page of a notebook that I had watched him write in for weeks and whose accuracy I had never questioned because accuracy was the thing he was.

"I didn't say that," I said.

The certainty was the problem. Not the disagreement — disagreement was recoverable, disagreement was the kind of cognitive event that minds accommodated through re-examination and correction. The certainty was not disagreement. The certainty was: I did not say those words. I had never said those words. The words were someone else's words attributed to me by a notebook that was wrong.

The notebook was not wrong.

I knew this. At the level where knowing operated independently of the cognitive system's report, at the level where the cliff had shown me that knowing and thinking were different systems — I knew the notebook was accurate. I knew because Xu Ran's documentation was compulsive and precise and because his compulsion was his survival and his precision was his identity and neither his survival nor his identity produced falsehood.

But I did not remember.

The memory was not there. Not suppressed — not the kind of memory that existed somewhere behind a barrier, accessible with effort, recoverable with the right trigger. Not there. The specific, clean absence of an experience that should have left a trace and that had left: nothing. A room where the lights had been turned off and the furniture removed and the room was empty and the empty was total.

"You said it this morning," Xu Ran said. "Three hours ago. At the center of the crater. You put your hand on the stone and you said: the stone vibrated."

Three hours. Not three centuries. Not the distant past where memory degradation was the natural consequence of neurological limitations. Three hours. The specific temporal interval that constituted the immediate past, the recent past, the past that memory systems were designed to preserve with high fidelity.

Gone.

Something had erased three hours.

Not me — I had not erased it. The erasing had occurred without my participation, without my consent, without the specific cognitive action that deliberate forgetting required. Something had erased it the way the substrate had stopped the fall — autonomously, unilaterally, without asking.

Something in me did not want me to remember what I had found at the crater.

The realization arrived with the specific cognitive temperature of a truth that was simultaneously frightening and informative. Frightening because: something inside me controlled what I knew. Informative because: the control was itself data. If something erased the memory, the memory contained something worth erasing. The erasing was evidence of value. The erasing was the thing that confirmed the search was working.

"Something is fighting me," I said.

The words were the first articulation of the specific dynamic that the crater and the cliff and the paths and the memory-loss all described: something inside me was resisting the investigation. Something inside me had its own objectives. Something inside me was protecting information from the person whose body contained the information.

Xu Ran wrote. Everything. Fast. The pen moving with the specific urgency of someone who understood that the woman standing in front of him might forget this conversation too, might forget the conclusion she had just reached, might lose the three minutes of this exchange the way she had lost the three hours of the morning.

He wrote because she might forget.

He was right to.

"You need to write this down yourself," he said. "Not trust yourself to remember. Not trust me to tell you. Write it."

I did not write. Writing required the specific investment of energy in external record-keeping that I had not performed in centuries because my memory had been reliable for millennia and reliability was the condition that made external records unnecessary.

My memory was no longer reliable.

The crater was behind us. The broken trees from the qi-anomaly — I did not remember the qi-anomaly. The cracked ground — I did not remember the cracked ground. The evidence was physical. The evidence was visible. The evidence was everywhere except in my memory.

Xu Ran held the notebook open. Showing me. The specific pages that documented events I had experienced and lost. The external record of my own life, maintained by someone else, because the internal record was being edited by something that was not me.

I read. His handwriting. His words. My experiences, translated through his observation.

I did not recognize them.

This was the specific horror. Not the forgetting — the not-recognizing. Reading someone else's account of my own actions and finding the account alien. Foreign. The words describing a person I did not recall being, doing things I did not recall doing, in a location I did not recall visiting.

The me in the notebook was a stranger.

"We keep going," I said. "And you keep writing."

He wrote that down too.
