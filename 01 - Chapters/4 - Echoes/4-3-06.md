# Chapter 23

Something woke me.

Not from sleep — I did not sleep. From the specific state that occupied the interval between wakefulness and the other state that was not sleep but that was also not the full engagement of consciousness. The state where the body was still and the mind operated at reduced capacity and the qi cycled in its autonomous pattern. The state where the eyes were open and the seeing was unfocused and the unfocusing was the closest approximation of rest that the system permitted.

Something had changed.

Xu Ran: asleep. Ten paces away. The specific even breathing that indicated deep sleep, the kind that his body produced with the efficiency that characterized everything about him. The fire: embers. The clearing: dark. The stars: in their positions, the specific configuration that indicated the hour was late and the lateness was confirmed by the temperature and the moisture and the quality of the darkness.

Everything external: unchanged.

Internal: different.

The impulse was there. The specific neurological event that I had experienced at the bramble wall — the pre-verbal, pre-thought impulse that existed in the space between perception and language. The impulse that had preceded the path's appearance. The one that said: should.

I had been looking at the river. Not directly — the river was beyond our clearing, forty paces east, audible as the specific sound of water-over-stone that rivers produced. I had been aware of the river. The river was in the wrong place.

Not wrong the way the branches had been wrong or the shadows had been wrong. Wrong in the way that only I could feel — the specific spatial awareness that millennia of traversing geography had installed, the background sense that said: rivers in this terrain follow specific valleys, and this valley is oriented north-south, and a river flowing east-west in this valley is geographically inconsistent.

The river was in the wrong place and the impulse said: move it.

The impulse was physical. In the fingertips. The specific tingling-pressure that preceded the deployment of qi and that usually indicated the body's readiness to act — the warmth in the hands, the charge that built in the channels, the specific sensation of power waiting for direction. But the direction was not martial. The direction was not defensive. The direction was: shift. Reshape. Edit.

The impulse said: move the river to where the river should be and the should-be is the reality and the reality is the thing I can make.

I caught myself.

The catching was the specific moment of awareness — like waking inside a dream, like the internal jolt that occurred when the falling-sensation interrupted sleep. I caught the impulse mid-formation. I caught it in the space between the want and the action. I caught it because the catching was the only thing that prevented the action and the action was — 

What was the action? What would have happened? If I had not caught the impulse — if the tingling had continued, if the qi had moved, if the direction had been followed — would the river have moved? Would I wake tomorrow to a river that had always flowed north-south, with riverbanks showing decades of erosion in the new direction, with stones polished by centuries of current that had existed for one night?

The question was not theoretical. The paths had happened. The cairn had happened. The reality had been edited and the editing was tied to my frustration and the frustration was a close neighbor of the impulse and the impulse —

Had felt right.

This was the worst part. Not the impossibility — impossibility was a category I had abandoned long ago, because millennia of existence made impossibility a matter of insufficient data rather than absolute truth. Not the power — power was something I had in quantities that exceeded any framework for measuring it. The worst part was: the impulse to reshape reality had felt correct. Natural. The way breathing felt natural. The way the qi-deflection of rain felt natural. An extension of something that was already operating rather than the initiation of something new.

It felt like remembering how.

Not learning. Remembering. The distinction was crucial. Learning was the acquisition of new capability. Remembering was the recovery of capability that had been present and had been — what? Forgotten? Suppressed? Sealed behind a barrier that was now cracking because the glass was cracking because Xu Ran and the question and the pain had cracked it and the cracks were letting through not just feelings but capabilities?

I clenched my fists. The qi receded. The tingling stopped. The impulse — the river-moving, reality-reshaping, should-be-imposing impulse — dissolved. Like a sound fading. Like breath released.

The river continued flowing east-west. In the wrong place. Geographically inconsistent. Real, in the way that reality was real when no one was editing it.

I did not sleep for the rest of the night. I had not been sleeping before. But this not-sleeping was different — this not-sleeping was the vigilant kind, the kind that watched itself, the kind that monitored the internal terrain for the return of the impulse that had felt right and whose rightness was the most frightening thing I had encountered in centuries.

Morning came. Xu Ran woke. He opened the notebook.

I watched him write the date, the weather, the first observations.

"Something happened," he said, without looking up. The specific perception of someone who had learned to read changes in the subject's baseline without requiring the subject's cooperation. "You're different this morning."

"Nothing happened."

He wrote that down.

Both of us knew which category the statement belonged to: the same category as "Then you weren't looking." The category of lies that were transparent and that were transparent because the liar did not have enough investment in the lie to make it opaque.

We walked. I walked ahead. He followed. The ten paces. The arrangement.

Inside me, the space where the impulse had been: empty. Watchful. Waiting for the next time the fingertips would tingle and the should-be would arrive and the arriving would feel like remembering.

The river remained wrong behind us. The river remained real.

So did I.
