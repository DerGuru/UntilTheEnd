# Chapter 4

A hut.

Abandoned. In the forest, off the path, the specific location of a structure that had been built by someone who wanted distance from other structures and whose wanting was the architecture and the architecture was: one room, four walls, a roof that leaked.

The door: broken. One hinge remaining, the other a hole in the frame where the metal had been and where the metal was no longer. The door hung at an angle — open, but not invitingly. Open the way broken things were open: by failure rather than design.

I went in.

Not because the hut offered something. The body moved from outside to inside because inside was a direction and direction was a change and change was the minimal disruption of the sameness that the body accepted by default.

Inside: dust. The specific layer that accumulated in spaces where air moved but brooms did not. On the floor, on the single surface that served as table, on the window frame where a shutter had been and where a shutter was no longer. Dust on everything.

A fireplace. Stone. Cold. Not recently cold — the cold of months, the specific temperature of mineral surfaces that had not been heated in the time it took for heat to become memory and memory to become absence. Ash, old. The remnants of a fire that someone had made and that the making of was the last thing the person did here or the last thing the fireplace remembered and the remembering was the ash.

I sat. On the floor. Against the wall. The position that the body chose when the body required a surface and the surface was available.

The hut contained space. Four walls of it. A ceiling's worth. The specific volume that a single room provided when the single room was the entire structure and the structure was the entire purpose.

Wei would have fixed the door.

The thought arrived without being summoned. Not a memory — a projection. The specific extrapolation that the mind performed when the mind encountered a stimulus and the stimulus was: broken hinge, hanging door, fixable problem. Wei would have looked at it. Would have assessed the damage — two minutes, maximum. Would have found a piece of wire or a strip of bark or anything that could serve as a temporary hinge. Would have fixed it. Not because fixing was important but because broken things bothered him and the bothering was the impulse and the impulse was the action and the action was: fixed.

The door hung. Broken. Unfixed. The absence of fixing was the absence of him.

Wei would have made fire.

The fireplace. Cold. The specific cold that fire would have corrected and that the correction would have produced warmth and that warmth was the thing that Wei produced in spaces simply by being in them. He would have gathered kindling — complained about it being wet, probably, the specific complaint that fourteen-year-olds produced when the world was insufficiently cooperative. Would have arranged it. Would have lit it with the qi-technique I'd taught him — the small, concentrated pulse that ignited dry material and that he'd mastered in the first attempt and that the mastering was the talent.

The fireplace stayed cold. Because no one made fire.

For a moment — the duration of a breath, maybe two — the disconnection wavered. The cable between stimulus and response: trembled. Not reconnected. Trembled. The specific vibration of a system that was offline but that felt the proximity of an input that was strong enough to travel the gap.

The smell of damp wood. The hut's walls: rotting, slowly, the specific decay that moisture produced in organic building materials. The smell arrived. Familiar. The universal signature of shelters that were kept alive by use and that died when use stopped.

It had smelled like this before. In another hut. In another lifetime — no, in this lifetime, in the part of this lifetime that contained him. The hut where Wei had first asked about fear.

"Are you afraid?"

His voice. Not a hallucination — not the specific auditory construction that grief produced in the recently bereaved. An imprint. The shape of his voice pressed into the architecture of hearing by repetition, by proximity, by the fact that his voice had occupied space in my environment for years and the occupying had left marks and the marks were permanent.

"Are you afraid?"

I had lied. "No."

He had laughed. The specific sound — short, sharp, the laugh of someone who knew a lie when they heard one and who found the hearing amusing rather than offensive. Not mocking. Knowing.

"Liar."

He was right. He was always right about the things that mattered and always wrong about the things that didn't and the distinction between the two was his genius and his blindness and his genius was his blindness.

I wanted it to cut. The memory — the imprint — the sensation of his voice in the rotting hut: I wanted it to penetrate the disconnection, to reach the place where the cables were pulled and to reconnect them with the specific violence of a current restored. I wanted the pain. The pain would have been confirmation that the system still existed, that the offline was temporary, that the capacity for feeling was dormant rather than destroyed.

It didn't cut.

It arrived. It sat in the space between stimulus and response. It was present. And then it receded, the way all inputs receded — into the data, into the archive of things that were received but not processed, into the category of information that passed through a system that had stopped converting information into experience.

Another smell. Older. From a different file in the archive. Not Wei — before Wei. Before this century.

A creature. The last of its kind. I had known that. The specific knowledge that came from being old enough to recognize endings — the signature of a species whose signature was the last signal of its type and whose type was ending. A plains-runner. Six legs, hollow bones, the evolutionary adaptation of a continent that no longer existed in its original form. Beautiful. And the last.

I killed it. From boredom. Not from hunger, not from necessity, not from the calculus of survival that justified violence. From boredom. The specific boredom of a being who had existed long enough that existing had become the texture and new textures were rare and rare was the category that included the last plains-runner and the killing of it.

Eight sentences of memory. Ten. The smell of bone marrow — hollow bones broke differently, the marrow thinner, the scent lighter. The satisfaction that lasted three seconds. The knowledge that the satisfaction was the extinction and the extinction was the boredom and the boredom was me.

Violence as numbing. Then and now. Different century, different target, same mechanism. The spirit-beast this morning — yesterday — whenever: the same act. Kill a thing. Wipe blood from fingers. Walk. The continuity of a pattern that spanned millennia and whose spanning was the evidence and the evidence was: I had been here before. In this state. In this hut. In this version of myself that killed things because killing was louder than silence and silence was the thing I could not bear.

Wei would have hated this too.

The thought arrived. And receded. And the receding was the disconnection. And the disconnection was the state.

Night.

Inside the hut. Against the wall. Eyes open. Ceiling: wood, rotting, gaps in the planking where starlight entered in thin lines that crossed the floor like scars.

Not sleeping. Not refusing sleep. The eyes open because closing them was the action and the action was absent. The ceiling visible because the ceiling was there and there was the data and data was.

I waited for more. More memory. More cutting. More of the thing that had briefly trembled the cable and that had almost connected and that had receded.

Nothing came.

Silence. The hut. The cold fireplace. The broken door.

The ceiling with its scars of light.
