# Chapter 5

The question came on the third day. Or the fifth. Or whichever interval the body had been walking since the hut, along paths that existed and through spaces that didn't have paths, through forests that were forests and clearings that were the absences of forests.

Something died at my feet.

A beetle. Small. Black. The specific variety that lived in leaf litter and that processed dead material into smaller dead material. It had been crossing the ground in front of me — purpose-driven, direct, the specific momentum of an organism following a scent-trail to food. It entered the radius.

It stopped. The legs folded. The body curled — not the defensive curl of a threatened insect but the involuntary curl of a system shutting down. It lay on its back. Legs twitching. Then not.

I watched.

Not deliberately — watching was the only action available when the thing being watched was at my feet and at my feet was where my eyes already pointed.

The beetle died because I was near it. The beetle died because my presence was the condition that produced death in small things. The beetle was dead and I was not.

The rock I sat on last night — the cold stone in the clearing where I had not slept — had frost on it when I sat down. The frost melted under me. Not from body heat, or not only from body heat. From the specific thermal signature that my presence produced in mineral surfaces. The frost melted. The stone warmed. I remained.

A tree branch — above me, overhanging the path. Its leaves: green when I passed beneath, brown by the time I emerged. The specific timeline of death-by-proximity: seconds. The branch would recover. I would not return.

Everything died. Near me. Around me. The grass, the insects, the leaves, the small living things that constituted the texture of a world that was alive and whose alive-ness I subtracted by being in it.

Everything except me.

The thought arrived not as language but as pressure. Internal. The specific physiological event that occurred when a truth that had been known conceptually became known physically — the translation from mind to body, from understanding to experiencing, the moment when a fact stopped being a fact and became a wound.

Everything dies near me. Except me.

The wound was not grief. Not anger. Not the named categories that emotional experience provided for people who experienced emotions in named categories. The wound was the specific shape of a question and the question was:

What protects me?

What is the mechanism? What is the thing that closes scratches and survives falls and regenerates tissue and maintains a body across millennia while every body near it fails? What is it?

And — the second part. The part that turned the question from curiosity into violence:

Why didn't it protect him?

It protects me. Always. From everything. Automatically, unconsciously, without request or consent. It closes wounds I do not notice. It heals damage I do not feel. It maintains a body I did not ask to maintain. It does this. Relentlessly. Without exception. Without interruption.

And Wei. Who stood beside me. Who lived in my house. Who ate my food and breathed my air and existed in the closest proximity available to another human being. Who was near enough that if the protection extended — if it reached beyond the boundaries of my body to the bodies in its proximity — he would have been inside the radius. Inside the field. Inside the range.

He wasn't.

The protection was for me. The protection was mine. The protection did not extend and the not-extending was the selectivity and the selectivity was the crime and the crime was the question and the question was:

WHY NOT HIM?

My qi jolted. Involuntary. The specific discharge of emotional energy that occurred when the emotional system — functional, present, not disconnected — collided with the disconnected will and the collision produced not action but eruption. A pulse. Outward.

The radius expanded. Three paces to five. The grass beyond the normal perimeter: browning. Faster. A circle of accelerated death spreading from where I stood, the tangible expression of a question that was not a question but a violence.

Trees at the edge: shuddering. Leaves falling — not autumn-falling, stress-falling, the specific release that plants performed when the environmental toxicity exceeded their capacity to hold. Leaves on the ground. Green, then brown. Brown, then dry.

The air: heavier. The specific atmospheric pressure that my emission produced in moments of intensity — the metallic taste, the weight, the feeling of standing in a room where the oxygen was being replaced by something that was not oxygen.

Then it passed. The pulse: receding. The radius: contracting back to three paces. The expanded death-zone: stabilizing, the grass already dead, the trees recovering at the edges, the small correction that the system performed when the system overrode the emotion and the overriding was the containment.

I stood.

In the expanded circle of dead grass. In the evidence of the question. In the physical manifestation of a thought that was not a thought but a wound and the wound was: why not him.

The question was the most alive thing inside me in weeks.

And that was the cruelest part. The question burned. The question was present. The question operated in the space where hunger and sleep and will had disconnected — it bypassed the disconnection, went straight to the functional emotional system, and produced: pain. Real pain. The kind that the body acknowledged because the body still felt and feeling was the function that remained when wanting stopped.

I did not answer the question. The question had no available answer. Not here, not in this forest, not in the category of things I knew and the category was large and the largeness did not contain this answer.

I walked.

The question walked with me. In the radius. In the brown. In the dead grass and the fallen leaves and the beetles that curled and stopped.

Why not him.
