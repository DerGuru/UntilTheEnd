# Chapter 3

The spirit-beast came from the east.

Large. The size of a horse, maybe larger — the proportions distorted by qi-saturation, the specific swelling that occurred when a biological organism absorbed ambient qi over decades and the absorption altered the geometry. Armored — not metal, not scale, something between: plates of hardened skin that covered the shoulders and spine, the evolutionary investment of a creature whose territory required physical defense.

It entered the radius. Unlike the ants, unlike the bird, unlike every living thing that had encountered my perimeter and chosen the rational response — this one came in. Either too territorial to yield or too qi-saturated to feel the difference or too large to care. It came in and the coming was the aggression and the aggression was: this is mine and you are in it and the in-it-ness is the violation and the violation requires response.

It charged.

The specific locomotion of a four-legged predator committing to engagement — the acceleration that compressed the distance between two bodies into the time it took for one body to reach the other. Fast. Heavy. The ground shaking under the specific weight of a qi-enhanced organism whose enhancement was its mass and whose mass was the weapon.

I moved.

Not because I decided to move. The body had reflexes that predated decisions — the ancient, pre-conscious responses that lived in the spine and the spine in the muscles and the muscles in the specific architecture of a nervous system that had been combat-trained for millennia and whose training was so deep that training was the wrong word. The word was: nature.

My hand. Open. Rising. Meeting the spirit-beast's charge at the point where the charge became the contact and the contact became the transfer. Qi — mine, not the beast's. A pulse. Targeted. Into the armored plate at the shoulder joint where the plate was thinnest and the thinnest was the vulnerability and the vulnerability was the function my hand knew and the knowing was the execution.

The plate cracked. The beast's momentum: redirected. Not stopped — diverted. Its body angling sideways, the physics of an interrupted charge producing rotation rather than impact. It slid past me. Three meters. Four. Claws scoring dirt.

It turned. Snarled. The sound of a creature whose territorial instinct had been challenged and whose instinct was louder than the data that said: leave.

I was already there. Beside it. Two steps — not combat-speed, something slower, the casual displacement of someone who did not need to be fast because fast implied effort and effort implied engagement and engagement was the thing that was not occurring.

My hand. On its skull. Between the plates. The specific point where the qi-channels converged in creatures of this type — the junction that regulated the enhanced biology, the node that maintained the saturation and whose maintenance was the life and whose life was the condition.

I pressed. The channel collapsed. The qi-structure beneath the skull: disrupted. Not gently. The specific efficiency of someone who had done this enough times that doing it was identical to not doing it in terms of internal experience.

The beast dropped. Mid-snarl. The sound cutting off as the body's systems cascaded from functioning to not-functioning in the specific sequence that followed qi-channel disruption: muscles first, then respiration, then circulation.

It lay. On the ground. Large. The plates of armor still intact, still gleaming with the specific luster of qi-hardened tissue. Dead.

I looked at my hand. Blood — the beast's, from the cracked plate, the fluid that had emerged when the shell broke. On my fingers. Between the knuckles. The specific coloration of qi-enhanced blood: darker than human, slightly iridescent.

I wiped it on my thigh. The way someone wiped dirt from their hands after gardening. The same gesture. The same investment of attention: none.

I did not look at the beast. I did not assess the kill. I did not register the fact that a qi-saturated territorial predator the size of a horse had attacked me and that the attack had lasted four seconds and that the four seconds had contained no adrenaline, no fear, no reflex of self-preservation, no pride of execution.

Nothing.

The equivalent of turning over a stone. The stone was there, now it was turned, the turning was done. The beast was there, now it was dead, the dead was done.

I walked. Past the body. The brown circle continuing around me, indifferent to the addition of a corpse to the terrain. The blood on my knuckles drying in the air — brown, matte, the residue of an event that was not an event because events required registration and registration required the system and the system was disconnected.

Behind me: the spirit-beast. Motionless. The forest: already accepting the body, the way forests accepted everything — patiently, with insects and decomposition and the slow conversion of dead into soil.

Ahead of me: more forest. More path. More of the same.

The blood dried.
