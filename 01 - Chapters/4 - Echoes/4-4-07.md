# Chapter 32

Morning. The cliff behind us. The specific geography of eight hundred meters of vertical stone receding as we walked — or as I walked and he followed, the dynamic unchanged, the ten paces maintained, the gradient from brown to yellow to green holding its ecological commentary.

But the walking was different.

Not faster — the body walked at the same velocity that it always walked, the specific pace that millennia of locomotion had standardized. Not more purposeful — purpose was still emerging, still forming in the space that the question had opened, still being assembled from the components that the cliff had provided. The difference was: direction.

I chose left.

At a fork in the path — a natural fork, a real fork, a fork that had existed before I arrived and that would exist after I left and that was not the product of frustration or impulse or the reality-editing that the substrate performed — I chose left. Left because left led downhill and downhill led to the lowlands and the lowlands led to the regions where I had lived before and the before-regions were the places where the investigation would begin.

I chose. The specific cognitive act that will performed — the weighing of options (left or right), the assessment of outcomes (downhill or uphill), the selection of one over the other (left). Will. The severed cable — not repaired. Not reconnected in the clean, functional manner that repair implied. Jury-rigged. The specific makeshift connection that occurred when something that was not quite will but was close enough to will performed the function that will had performed and the performance was adequate if not elegant.

Xu Ran noticed the choice. The noticed was visible in his notebook — he wrote as he walked, the pen moving in the specific rhythm that said: she chose. She chose left. She evaluated and selected and the evaluating and selecting were behavioral markers of cognitive restoration and the cognitive restoration was: significant.

He did not comment. He followed left.

The path descended. Through terrain that was terrain — trees, slope, the specific lowland transition that mountains produced when they stopped being mountains. The path had the specific quality of paths that other people had walked — worn, navigated, the communal erosion of regular traffic. A real path. Not mine. Not the substrate's. The world's.

The dust was on my robes. The fine grey particles from the cliff's base, the landing zone, the place where eight hundred meters of falling had concluded in floating and settling and standing. The dust was evidence. I had not cleaned it. The not-cleaning was: deliberate. The dust was the only physical evidence that the fall had happened and the fall was the thing that had changed everything and the everything-changed needed evidence.

I would investigate.

The thought was formed — not the impulse-before-thought, not the pre-verbal substrate-level event that preceded cognition. An actual thought. The specific cognitive product that a mind produced when the mind was engaged and the engagement was directed. I would investigate what I was. I would find the places where I had survived things before — the old sites, the old falls, the old wounds, the old deaths-that-weren't-deaths. I would examine them. I would look for patterns. I would do the thing that minds did when minds were operational: I would think.

The humming accompanied. Beneath the ribs. Low. The second breathing that was the substrate's respiration through my channels. The humming was present the way my own breathing was present — constant, unremarkable in its constancy, the background condition of being alive in the specific manner that I was alive.

The question accompanied. What am I. Not as weight — as compass. The question in the chest where the hand had pressed, in the space where the substrate had said no to the fall, in the location that was neither body nor mind but the thing between.

Xu Ran walked behind me. Ten paces. The gradient. His notebook in his hand, the pen moving. His breathing — the specific respiratory pattern that walking at elevation produced in a cultivator with a broken core, the slight elevation of rate that indicated effort — accompanied.

We were two people walking away from a cliff.

Behind us: eight hundred meters of the thing I had survived and the way I had survived it and the knowledge that survival was not mine.

Ahead: the lowlands. The investigation. The search for what I was.

The path descended. We descended with it. The distance from the cliff increased and the increasing was not away-from but toward — toward the next thing, the first step of the investigation, the beginning of the looking-in that the question demanded.

The shift was done.

Not visible — not in the manner of narrative events that announced themselves with changes in weather or music or the specific environmental markers that stories used to indicate transformation. The shift was internal. The shift was the difference between a compass that spun and a compass that pointed. The compass pointed. The compass pointed in.

I walked. He followed. The humming continued. The gradient held. Two figures descending through mountain terrain toward the lowlands below, the specific image that would become — if anyone were watching from a distance — the template for the next months. One ahead. One behind. Moving.

Not healed. Not recovered. Not the narrative satisfaction of someone who emerged from darkness into light.

Moving. Toward a question. And from the question: the possibility of an answer.

The dust on my robes. The humming in my chest. The ten paces between me and the person who documented everything.

The cliff behind us. The answer ahead.

We walked.
