# Chapter 2

The body stood.

Not a decision. Not the product of wanting or needing or the cascade of internal events that connected a state to an action through the intermediary of will. The body stood because the body had a mechanism that said: enough sitting. And the mechanism was not consciousness. It was older. Deeper. The biomechanical reflex of an organism whose organism-ness included: movement was the default, stillness was the interruption, and the interruption had ended.

I walked.

The path — there was a path. Left of the oak, through the undergrowth, a line worn into the forest floor by repetition. Animal, probably. Deer, or the larger things that deer-size creatures wore into dirt by traveling the same route for generations and whose generations were the path and the path was the inheritance.

I followed it. Not because left was better than right. Because left was where the path was and the path was a direction and direction was the thing that the body required when the mind abdicated and the mind had abdicated.

The brown circle moved with me. Three paces. The specific perimeter of dying that accompanied each step — grass behind me: dead. Grass ahead: alive until I arrived, then dying, then dead. The trail of someone whose trail was the opposite of footprints: not evidence of presence but evidence of absence. Where I walked, the world subtracted.

Trees. Large. Their trunks within the radius: bark drying slightly, leaves losing rigidity. Outside the radius: fine. Normal. Green. The boundary — sharp, specific — moved as I moved and the boundary was the fact and the fact was the border between the livable and the not-livable and the not-livable was my company.

I walked.

Day shifted. The light — filtered, forest-quality — changed angles. Afternoon became something else. The temperature dropped by increments that I registered as data and data was what I received because receiving was the function that remained when processing had left.

A berry. On a branch. Arm's reach. Red, ripe, the specific fruit of a bush that produced food for things that consumed food. My hand remained at my side. The hand did not know about the berry. The hand knew about swinging, about balance, about the mechanical accompaniments of bipedal locomotion. It did not know about reaching because reaching required wanting and wanting was the cable and the cable was disconnected.

I passed the berry. It stayed red. I stayed walking.

Night arrived. Not fell — arrived. The specific transition of forests: gradual, the light withdrawing in layers, the canopy filtering the sunset until the sunset was a rumor and the rumor was darkness and darkness was the environment.

I walked.

Not through the night as an act of endurance. Through the night because stopping required the decision to stop and the decision was the function and the function was absent. My legs operated. The path continued. The mechanics of forward movement continued because the mechanics had not received the instruction to discontinue and the instruction required the will and the will was the thing that was disconnected.

Stars. Visible through the canopy in patches. The specific pinpoints of light that the sky produced at night and that the sky withdrew at day and that the production and withdrawal of was the cycle and the cycle was the time and time was the thing I did not have because having required awareness and awareness was selective and the selection was: not this.

A sound. Close. Not the distant branch-crack of hours ago — close. The specific sound of feathers adjusting. Wings. Small.

A bird. On the branch beside me. Small — a warbler, maybe, or the forest-dwelling variety that occupied the mid-canopy and that came lower at dusk. It had landed. On the branch directly adjacent to my path. Close enough that the normal radius should have prevented it. Close enough that the ants would have diverted.

One second. The bird: there. Present. Its head turning — the specific avian rotation that birds performed when assessing proximity. Small eyes. Bright. Looking at me or looking at the space I occupied without distinguishing between the two.

It twitched. The full-body shudder that birds performed when something changed in their environment and the changing was the signal and the signal was: wrong. Every feather adjusted simultaneously. The bird became smaller, tighter, the posture of exit.

It flew. Away. Fast. The wing-sounds disappearing into the canopy above and beyond and the beyond was the world where birds could land without twitching.

Two seconds. Total.

The first living thing to approach me in — however long this was. And it lasted two seconds. And the two seconds ended with the same conclusion that everything reached: not here.

I walked.

Past the branch where the bird had been. Past the berry that stayed red. Past the trees whose bark dried and recovered in my wake. Into the forest. Into the dark. Into the continuation of a body that continued because continuing was the mechanism and the mechanism was all that remained.

The brown circle, constant. The forest, infinite. The walking, perpetual.

And the bird, gone.
