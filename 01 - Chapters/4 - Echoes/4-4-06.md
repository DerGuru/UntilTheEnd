# Chapter 31

Xu Ran was at the camp. Twenty paces from the cliff's edge. His pack on the ground. His notebook in his hands.

He had seen it.

His face told the story before his mouth could — the specific configuration of features that a human face produced when the processing system behind it had received input that exceeded its framework by a magnitude that required structural revision. The face was pale. Not the pale of fear — the pale of recalibrated understanding. The permanent-pale. The kind that meant: I will never be the same color as before.

"What," he said. Then stopped. The word had been the beginning of a sentence and the sentence had not continued because the sentence's continuation required the selection of language adequate to the phenomenon and the phenomenon had no adequate language.

He tried again.

"What was that?"

Three words. The same three words he had asked at other moments of anomaly — the branches, the path, the pulsing. But the delivery was different. The branches-voice had been curious. The path-voice had been analytical. The pulsing-voice had been watchful.

This voice was shattered.

He had watched a person step off an eight-hundred-meter cliff. He had watched the fall — the descent, the seconds that he could not have counted but that he could estimate from the distance and the duration and the specific visual of a human body diminishing against grey stone. He had watched the fall stop. He had watched the floating. He had watched the settling. He had watched the standing-at-the-bottom that should not be standing at the bottom.

His notebook was open and the pages were — I could see from here — half-filled with writing that was worse than his usual miniature precision. Larger. Uneven. The specific handwriting degradation that occurred when the writer's hands were unsteady and the unsteadiness was not cold or fatigue but the physiological expression of having one's reality revised.

His hand was still shaking. The pen trembled against the page.

"You jumped," he said.

"Yes."

"Eight hundred meters."

"Approximately."

"You're standing here."

"Yes."

The asymmetry was the scene. He was shattered and I was calm and the calm was new and the new-calm was different from the old-calm. The old-calm had been the absence of engagement — the disconnection, the not-caring, the specific stillness that emptiness produced. This calm was the presence of something. The presence of: resolution. The specific internal temperature that a mind achieved when a question had replaced a void and the question was a better occupant than the void.

He wrote. The pen moving in the shaking rhythm. His hand: unsteady. His breathing: the specific irregular pattern that indicated the autonomic nervous system was still processing the threat-response that the cliff-jump had triggered. He was scared. Not for himself — for the specific category of reality in which a person could jump off a cliff and stand at the bottom and the category was: unstable.

"How," he said.

I looked at him. The looking was deliberate — directed, intentional, the specific deployment of attention that I had not practiced since before the forest. I looked at Xu Ran and the looking was: assessment. Not clinical. Honest.

"I don't know," I said. "Not yet."

The not-yet was mine. The same not-yet that he used — the word that contained the assumption of eventual understanding. I had borrowed his word. Or the word had migrated, the way words migrated between people who spent enough time in proximity. Not yet. Currently unresolved but resolvable.

He closed the notebook. His hand was still shaking. He put the notebook in his pack — the specific gesture that indicated he was done writing for now, not because the data was complete but because the data was too large for the hand to hold.

Evening came. He built a fire. He cooked. The standard procedure — the ginger, the rice, the scratched pot on the stones. The routine was his anchor and the anchor was needed because the rest of his reality had been cast adrift by the sight of a woman floating above rocks.

He meditated. Louder than usual — the specific volume increase that indicated the noise-need had intensified, the anti-silence compulsion responding to a day that had been too quiet in its impossibility. The mantras were faster. The humming was more insistent. The breathing was theatrical in the way that desperation made things theatrical.

I sat at six paces. The fire between us. His meditation filling the space with sound, the specific acoustic output that I had complained about and endured and complained about again and that was now —

I knew the rhythm.

The specific sequence of mantras — the rise and fall, the contour that was not melody but resembled it, the succession of syllables that repeated every forty seconds — I knew it. Not from study. From exposure. From the accumulated repetitions that twenty-three nights of the ten-pace distance had installed in my auditory memory without my auditory memory requesting the installation.

I knew when his breathing would deepen. I knew when the mantra would conclude and the humming would bridge. I knew when the humming would accelerate and the next mantra would begin.

The knowing was — precisely — the kind of knowing that familiarity produced. The knowledge that came from proximity. The specific category of learning that occurred without intent, without direction, without the deliberate study that Xu Ran's kind of knowing required. I knew his meditation the way one knew the sound of one's own house — the creaking, the settling, the specific noises that a structure made when it existed long enough to become: known.

I noticed that I knew.

The noticing was the data. The noticing said: something in me still learned. Something in me still absorbed. Something in me still processed the proximity of another person and converted the proximity into knowledge and the knowledge into — what?

Not comfort. Not yet. The word for what it was: familiarity. The specific emotional category that existed one step below attachment and one step above indifference. Familiarity was the knowledge that this sound came next and the knowledge that the sound's coming-next was: expected.

I expected.

Expected. As in: anticipated. As in: the future contained a predictable element and the predictable was: his meditation rhythm. The future contained something I knew about before it happened and the knowing-before was the specific temporal relationship that hope required as its precondition and the precondition was —

Not hope. Not yet. Just: expectation. Just: the first stirring of a mind that had decided the future was a space that contained things rather than a space that was empty.

He meditated. I expected. The rhythm continued. The fire burned. The night was cold and the cold was external and the internal was: one degree warmer than before.

He slept, eventually. The silence returned. The Xu-Ran-shaped hole in the silence that I had noticed before was still there.

I sat in the silence. In the hole. In the one-degree-warmer-than-before.

The humming beneath my ribs continued. The substrate breathing. The echo.
