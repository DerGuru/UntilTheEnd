# Chapter 7

Night again. Or still. The distinction had ceased to operate somewhere in the last several cycles, the body's internal clock maintaining a rhythm that had nothing to do with the body's internal experience. The sky darkened. The sky lightened. The body walked through both states without differentiation.

The clearing was the kind that existed because something had died in it — a large tree, decades ago, the absence creating space and the space filling with grass and low shrubs and the specific secondary growth that colonized gaps. The stump was still there. Massive. The rotting kind that housed insects and fungi and the entire micro-civilization that processed dead wood into soil.

Except near me. The stump's inhabitants — gone. The radius had cleared them. The grass in the clearing: browned in a circle around where I stood, green at the edges, the familiar gradient.

I stood in the center of the dead circle in the center of the clearing. Eyes open. The stars were there, the specific density of mountain-altitude stars that operated without cloud cover, the kind of sky that featured in poems about solitude.

The humming was there too.

Low. Below hearing, almost. A vibration in the chest — not from outside, from inside. The specific resonance that my core produced in moments of ambient stillness, when external input decreased to the point where internal processes became audible. Not audible. Felt. The distinction mattered: this was not sound. This was the physical sensation of qi moving in patterns that had no purpose, the idle cycling of a system that was vast and old and that operated whether I wanted it to or not.

The humming had been there since the hut. Maybe before. The specific timeline was unclear because attention to internal phenomena required the kind of self-directed focus that the disconnection impaired. But it was there now. A low, continuous vibration. The sound of being alive against my will.

The spirit-beast arrived at the clearing's edge.

Different species from the first one. This one: smaller. The size of a large wolf — or the size of a thing that resembled a wolf the way spirit-beasts resembled the animals they had once been. Dark fur. The qi-armor: thinner, less developed. A younger beast, or a weaker one. The kind that operated at the margins of territories controlled by stronger beasts and that scavenged what larger predators left behind.

Its eyes were pale. Reflective in the starlight. They found me across the clearing and they held.

The beast did not enter the dead circle. It stood at the edge — the precise edge, the boundary between brown grass and green, the line that marked the limit of my chronic emission. It tested the boundary the way animals tested invisible barriers: one paw forward, a flinch, a withdrawal. The paw: retreated. The beast: stayed.

Watching me. From the safe side of the radius.

I watched it back.

The watching lasted. Long enough for the kind of mutual assessment that occurred between two organisms determining the threat-level of the other. The beast's assessment: accurate. I was threat. The dead circle confirmed this. The dead grass, the absent insects, the specific silence that surrounded me — all of it confirming that the thing standing in the center of the clearing was the thing that produced death in its environment.

The beast's ears flattened. Its body lowered. The retreat posture — the configuration that preceded backing away, the preliminary geometry of flight.

I walked toward it.

Not from aggression. Not from hunger. Not from any of the categories that produced movement-toward in organisms that operated with functional will. From a different thing. A specific, nameless thing that existed in the gap between the disconnected will and the functional emotional system and the thing was:

Need.

Not want. Want was disconnected. But need — need operated below want, in the older systems, the systems that predated consciousness and choice and the elaborate architecture of decided action. Need was the thing that made the body breathe when the body did not choose to breathe. Need was the thing that produced sleep in animals that were trying to stay awake. Need was involuntary and the involuntary was the category that the disconnection had not reached.

I needed something to respond to me. Something to acknowledge the fact of my presence — not with death, not with dying, not with the curling and stopping and silent departing that everything else performed. Something to respond. Something to react. Something to be alive and near me and remain alive and near me for long enough that the gap between my existence and the world's would narrow for one instant.

The beast, or anything. Anything.

I crossed the dead circle toward the edge. The beast: reversing. Backing away. The specific backwards movement of a quadruped that would not turn its back on a threat. Step. Step. The pale eyes: locked on mine.

I stopped.

It stopped.

The distance between us: six paces. Twice the radius. Safe, from its perspective. Its body: still low, still flattened, the muscles engaged for flight. Its breath: visible in the cold air, the small clouds that formed and dissolved, formed and dissolved.

I stood.

Not advancing. Not retreating. Standing at the edge of the dead circle where the brown grass met the green and the meeting was the boundary and the boundary was the line that separated what I was from what lived.

The beast waited. Thirty seconds. A minute. The specific duration of assessment that animals performed before committing to a decision. Then it lowered a fraction further, turned — not in flight, in the deliberate turning of an animal that had decided the threat was stationary — and moved into the tree line. Slowly. Without panic. The specific departure of a creature that was choosing distance, not fleeing danger.

It disappeared between the trees. The forest absorbed it. The pale eyes: gone.

I stood at the boundary. Brown side and green side. The transition visible on the ground like a border drawn with a compass. My feet on the brown side because my feet were always on the brown side.

The need remained. Unanswered. The specific hunger for contact that existed below the disconnection and that the disconnection could not reach because the disconnection operated on will and the need operated on something older.

The humming in my chest continued. Low. Constant. The sound I made just by being.

I stood in the clearing until morning, eyes open, and the stars moved overhead in the specific arc that indicated the passage of time and the passage of time indicated that I was still here and the still-being-here was the thing that would not stop.

The morning came. Light changed. Temperature shifted. The body registered both without preference. At some point motion replaced stillness because motion was what the body defaulted to when stillness had exhausted its options and stillness always exhausted its options because nothing happened in stillness and nothing was the thing I already had.

I walked.

The radius walked with me. Three paces. The consistent measurement of damage that my existence produced. The continuous arithmetic of proximity: everything within three paces moved toward death and everything beyond three paces was alive and the three paces was the distance between me and everything.

Behind me: the clearing. The dead circle inside it. The stump that no longer housed insects. The specific evidence that I had been there, readable in the grass for weeks, interpretable by anyone who understood what killed vegetation in perfect circles.

Ahead: more forest. More living things arranged in the specific patterns that life produced in the absence of interference. Waiting for the interference to arrive.

The humming continued. Low. Below everything.

I walked into the part that was still alive.
