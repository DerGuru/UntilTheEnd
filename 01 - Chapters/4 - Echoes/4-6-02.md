# Chapter 44

The clearing was adequate.

Morning light arrived through the canopy gap that the clearing provided — the specific illumination of a space that had been cleared by natural means, a fallen tree, a rockslide, the organic processes that created openings in forest structure. The clearing was approximately forty paces across. Flat. The ground was compacted earth with sparse grass. Good visibility. Good footing.

I stood in the center. Xu Ran stood at ten paces.

The phial was in my hand. Ceramic. Warm. The wax seal intact. The specific weight of two mouthfuls of liquid that dissolved immortality in ninety seconds.

I looked at Xu Ran. He was holding his notebook — the first one, the personal one. The brush was wet. His posture was the specific configuration of observation: weight forward, eyes moving, the alignment of someone recording rather than participating.

"Ready?" I asked.

He did not answer with a word. He raised the brush slightly. The specific gesture of: proceed.

I broke the seal. The wax crumbled. Fragments fell to the compacted earth. The phial was open. The lack of smell persisted — the nothing-smell that was the specific characteristic of a substance designed to be undetectable.

I drank.

One motion. The phial to the lips. The tilt. The liquid — thin, the consistency of water, the temperature of ambient — entered my mouth and I swallowed and the ceramic was empty and the action was completed in the specific interval of time that a single swallow required.

The clearing held its features. The light. The trees at thirty paces. Xu Ran at ten. The phial in my hand, empty.

I waited.

The waiting was the experiment. The controlled variable was: how long before the substrate responds. The cliff had been instantaneous — the fall was the threat and the response was the stop and the interval was: none. Zero. The mechanics of reflexive protection. But the poison was different. The poison was chemical, not kinematic. The threat was internal, not external. The threat arrived through the blood, not through gravity.

I waited.

Five seconds. I felt: nothing. The liquid was in my stomach. The absorption process was underway. The pharmacological timeline according to the scroll was: absorption in fifteen seconds, onset at thirty, full meridian dissolution beginning at forty-five, death at ninety.

Ten seconds.

Xu Ran's brush moved. He was writing. The specific speed of someone documenting in real time, the abbreviated shorthand that prioritized capture over legibility.

Fifteen seconds. The absorption should be complete.

Twenty seconds.

I felt it.

The onset was not what I expected. The scroll had described burning — the meridians responding to the compound's approach the way nerve endings responded to acid. Burning. Progressive. Peripheral to central.

What I felt was: cold.

Not the cold of temperature. The cold of absence. The specific cold of something being removed — the way an amputated limb produces cold where there was warmth, not because the temperature changed but because the presence changed. Something was being eaten. The Shadow-Eater was eating. And the eating felt like cold because the thing being eaten had been warm and its absence was: nothing.

The peripheral channels.

I felt them go. The minor meridians in my fingers, my toes, the fine capillary network that cultivation produced in the extremities of Immortal-level practitioners. They went. One by one. Not pain — absence. Cold absence. The specific sensation of a system being dismantled from the edges inward.

Twenty-five seconds.

"Fingers," I said. Flat. Clinical. The observational report that the experiment required. "The peripheral channels are dissolving."

Xu Ran wrote.

Thirty seconds. The secondary channels. The major meridians in my arms and legs. The compound was progressing inward. On schedule. The scroll's timeline was accurate. The pharmaceutical precision of an assassination compound that performed as designed.

I watched myself die. From the edges. The qi-structure that had been part of my body for longer than I could remember was being removed. Layer by layer. Channel by channel. The Shadow-Eater ate, and the eating was silent and cold and systematic.

Cold. So cold. The specific cold of losing something that had been there for so long that its presence was indistinguishable from selfhood.

The primary channels.

Thirty-five seconds. The large meridians. The central architecture. The load-bearing structure that held my immortal body together. The Shadow-Eater reached them and began.

I felt it. The specific sensation of structural failure beginning. Not pain. Worse than pain. The sensation of becoming: less. The architecture was dissolving and the body that depended on the architecture was beginning to follow and the beginning was: this.

Forty seconds.

The dantian.

The compound reached my core. The center. The place where the qi-structure originated, where the entire meridian network converged, where the power that had kept me alive for millennia resided.

The Shadow-Eater began to eat.

And then —
