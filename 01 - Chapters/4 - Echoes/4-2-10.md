# Chapter 17

The path existed because paths existed — the worn lines that animals and water and the persistent pressure of footsteps carved into terrain over time. This one ran east through diminishing forest toward lower ground and toward the kind of open landscape that mountains produced when they tired of being mountains and the tiring was the geography that characterized the foothills.

I walked. Behind me: ten paces. Behind the ten paces: Xu Ran.

We had been walking for three days since the departure. Or four. The number was his department — the specific responsibility that his notebook assumed and that I had silently ceded because the ceding required no effort and the number-tracking required effort that I did not have.

The dynamic had stabilized. Not settled — stabilized. The specific equilibrium that two objects in motion achieved when their velocities matched and their distance remained constant and the constant was the agreement that neither party had articulated. I walked. He followed. The ten paces held. The gradient held: brown, yellow, green. The ecology around me and the ecology around him and the ecology between us.

He cooked at nightfall. I sat six paces from the fire. The ginger smell reached me and I did not eat and he did not offer and the not-offering was the arrangement and the arrangement was the respect that existed between someone who had stopped performing and someone who had stopped expecting.

"You're staring," he said, on the second evening.

"I'm evaluating."

"You said that last time."

"The evaluation is ongoing."

He looked up from the pot. The specific glance of someone processing information that was unexpected — not the words themselves but the quantity. Four words. The longest voluntary response since his arrival, exceeding the previous record by a factor that his notebook would document.

He returned his attention to the pot. He did not smile. Xu Ran, I was learning, did not smile in the conventional sense — his face performed a different operation, a compression of features that looked like concentration but that occupied the same functional category as amusement. The compression happened. He stirred.

"Your technique is wasteful," I said.

This was not evaluating. This was judgment. The specific vocalization of a qualitative assessment regarding his cooking methodology and the methodology was — objectively, from the perspective of someone who had observed cooking across civilizations — wasteful. He used too much water. The ginger was cut too thick. The heat was distributed unevenly because the stone arrangement was a configuration that maximized stability rather than thermal efficiency.

"My technique," he said, with the compression-face, "keeps me alive."

"Barely."

He stopped stirring. The compression-face intensified. He looked at me across six paces of gradient — across the transition zone where life became death became life — and the looking was the specific assessment of someone recalibrating. He was recalibrating. The subject had offered criticism. The subject had engaged.

He wrote something. One line. Then resumed stirring.

We walked. Through the foothills. Through the transition between mountain forest and lowland vegetation, the specific ecological shift that altitude produced and that I had observed in this region approximately twelve times over the centuries and that was always gradual and always unremarkable and always the same.

Except: the pair of us. The two-body system that occupied the landscape differently than a single body. The single body had been a point — a location, a coordinate, a source of death-radius with no relational component. The two-body system was a line. A vector with magnitude and direction. A thing that pointed somewhere even if the somewhere was undetermined.

The path narrowed on the fourth morning. Forest pressed in — denser, older, the kind of growth that indicated a region not recently traversed by humans. The canopy closed. The light diminished. The specific conditions that characterized deep forest in lowland terrain, the conditions that reduced visibility and that reduced awareness and that increased the probability of encounters with things that lived in reduced visibility.

Xu Ran shortened the distance. Not deliberately — the path forced it. The narrowing produced proximity that the standard terrain did not, the specific compression that dense growth imposed on the ten-pace protocol. Eight paces. Seven.

At seven paces, the grass between us yellowed. The transition zone had compressed. He was inside the outer gradient.

"Back up," I said.

"The path doesn't let me."

"Then walk slower."

"Then I lose you."

The logic was accurate. The path was narrow and the narrowness forced proximity and the proximity forced the gradient and the gradient forced the choice between distance and connection and the choice was: which mattered more.

He did not back up. He adjusted — angling to the side, finding the path's margin, the specific extra inches that one body-width of offset provided. Seven and a half paces. The grass: pale yellow. Not brown. Not dead. The specific intermediate state of vegetation under moderate pressure, the state that said: I am stressed but I survive.

He walked in the stress-zone. Not the death-zone. Not the life-zone. The specific intermediate space that existed between the two, the space that characterized everything about his relationship to me — not safe, not lethal, the narrow band of survivable proximity.

We emerged from the dense growth into a clearing. The kind that ridgelines produced — a break in the canopy, a view, the specific vantage point that geography provided at intervals. The lowlands spread below. Rolling. Green. The patchwork of cultivated land and wild land that human settlement produced on fertile terrain.

Ahead: distance. The character of the terrain suggested days of travel. Weeks. The specific scale of landscape that indicated that wherever we were going was not close and that the not-close was the condition and the condition was acceptable because the condition was movement and movement was the thing that the vector had demanded.

"If you want to come," I said, "keep up."

The sentence was the first complete instruction I had issued since the departure. Not a request. Not an invitation. An instruction — the specific speech-act that incorporated authority and direction and that assumed the listener's compliance and that did not negotiate. Keep up. Or don't. The verb is yours.

"Where are we going?" he asked.

I walked.

He followed.

The clearing shrank behind us. The path ahead descended into the lowlands, into the terrain that would produce the encounters and the distances and the time that the next section of existence required. Behind us: the forest. The death-circles. The hut and the clearing and the oak root and the weeks of standing and the weeks of silence and the slow, measurable thaw.

Ahead: the lowlands. Two figures descending. One ahead. One behind. Between them: ten paces restored, the gradient normalized, the specific distance that coexistence required between a desert that breathed and a scholar who feared silence.

The morning air carried the smell of the lowlands — wet earth, grass, the specific humidity that indicated rivers and the proximity of water and the proximity of the kind of world that contained other people and other problems and the other-ness that I had temporarily avoided and that could no longer be avoided.

The path descended. We descended with it. The dynamic of the next months — the years — the next chapter of whatever this existence was: established. One ahead. One behind. Ten paces. Moving.

Not healing. Not recovered. Not the narrative satisfaction of someone who found purpose in the wreckage.

Moving. And from moving, the possibility of more.
