# Chapter 8

He appeared on the fourth day after the clearing. Or the sixth. The specific number was irrelevant because the specific mechanism for caring about numbers had disconnected along with everything else that required preference.

He stood at the edge of the forest.

Not dramatically. Not in the manner of a person making an entrance or establishing presence or performing any of the elaborate social choreography that arrivals usually involved. He stood. At the tree line. Twenty paces from where my trajectory would take me through a gap between two pines. He stood and he waited.

I registered him the way I registered the trees: as an object in the visual field. A vertical shape. Human-shaped. Human-sized. The specific configuration of limbs and torso and head that indicated a male cultivator, mid-twenties, the particular build of someone whose body reflected discipline rather than labor. Dark hair. Dark eyes. A pack on his back — worn, patched, the specific deterioration that indicated weeks of travel.

A notebook in his left hand. Already open.

I walked.

My trajectory did not change. The gap between the pines was where the body walked and the body walked there and the human-shaped object at the edge of the forest was not an obstacle and was not a destination and was therefore irrelevant to the trajectory.

I passed him at twelve paces. Twice the radius. The grass between us — green. Safe distance. His distance, specifically — chosen with the precision of someone who had studied the death-circle and calculated its boundary.

He did not speak. Not immediately. He watched me pass with the specific attention of a researcher observing a phenomenon — no fear, no reverence, no pity, only the concentrated gaze of someone who was seeing something he had traveled a considerable distance to see.

I continued walking. Behind me: his footsteps. Following. The specific rhythm of someone matching pace at a deliberate distance — not closing the gap, not falling behind, maintaining the exact twelve paces that kept him outside the radius.

He followed for hours. Through forest. Through clearings. Through the specific terrain that the body traversed without choosing to traverse it. He followed with the patient endurance of someone who had decided following was the activity and who would perform the activity until the activity was complete.

At nightfall — the specific diminishment of light that indicated the body should stop, would stop, would stand or sit because darkness made walking less efficient — I stopped. In a clearing. The standard clearing: grass, space, sky overhead. I stood.

He sat.

Ten paces from me. At the edge of the radius — no. Beyond the edge. At the specific distance that said: I am near but I am not inside. I am present but I am not imposing. I am here.

He sat on the grass and the grass under him remained green and the grass near me browned and the space between us was the gradient that measured my toxicity: brown to yellow to green.

He opened the notebook. He wrote.

I stood. Eyes on the middle distance. The specific unfocused gaze that indicated the absence of directed attention — not looking at him, not looking away from him, not looking at anything. Standing.

"My name is Xu Ran."

His voice was clear. The specific clarity of someone who spoke to be heard, not to be acknowledged — the distinction between communication and request. He was communicating. He was not requesting.

I said nothing.

"I've been searching for you for three months."

Three months. The information entered the registry the way the beetle had entered the registry, the way the stream had entered the registry — data, received, filed, not processed. Three months was a unit of time and time was a thing that passed and the passing was independent of my participation.

"The withered forests were not difficult to follow."

He said this without accusation. Without judgment. The specific tone of someone reporting a navigational method — I followed the dead zones, the way one follows a river or a ridge or any landmark that persists. He had tracked my toxicity through miles of forest, reading the dead grass and the silent birds and the brown circles the way a tracker read footprints.

I was not difficult to find. I was the easiest thing in the world to find, because everything I touched died and death was the most visible marker in a living landscape.

He continued writing. The pen moved in the specific rhythm of someone for whom notation was compulsive — not deliberate, not chosen, performed. He wrote the way I walked: because the body did it regardless of whether the mind decided it should.

"I'm going to sleep," he said, after a silence that lasted long enough for the stars to appear. "I'll still be here in the morning."

He said this to the clearing, or to me, or to the notebook, or to the specific category of the universe that included all organisms currently registering his presence. He said it and he curled onto his side on the green grass at the safe distance and he closed his eyes.

I stood.

Eyes open. Stars overhead. The humming in my chest: constant, low, the vibration that said alive and the alive-saying was directed at no one and the no one now included a person sleeping ten paces away on grass that remained green because ten paces was outside the radius.

His breathing: even. The specific respiration pattern of someone who slept deeply and quickly, the efficiency of a body that had learned to sleep in any condition because the conditions were rarely ideal. He slept on the ground, in the open, ten paces from something that killed grass and beetles and spiders, and he slept with the specific confidence of someone who had calculated the risk and accepted it.

I did not sleep.

Morning came. He was still there. He had said he would be and he was and the being-there was a fact and the fact was registered.

He opened his eyes. He sat up. He looked at me — still standing, same position, eyes open — and he did not comment on the fact that I had not moved. He opened the notebook. He wrote.

Then he spoke.

"You don't eat."

An observation. Not a question. He had set food near me at some point during the night — rice, from a container, cold, placed six paces from me where the grass was yellow and the food was technically in the transition zone between death and life. I had not eaten it. I had not noticed it. Eating required the detection of hunger and hunger had disconnected.

"You don't sleep."

He was cataloguing me. The way a scholar catalogued a specimen. Methodical. Detached. Without the warmth that characterized concern and without the coldness that characterized indifference — something between. Professional attention. The specific attention of someone who observed because observation was the objective.

"And you don't leave," he said. "So. Neither will I."

He wrote.

I stood.

The grass around me: dead. The grass around him: alive. Between us: the gradient. The ten paces of transition from what I was to what the world was. He occupied the living side. I occupied the other.

He was still there.
