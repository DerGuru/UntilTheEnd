# Chapter 10

He told me about Wei on an evening when the fire was low and the smoke drifted east and the smoke smelled like damp wood.

The smell was the trigger. Not his words — the smoke. The specific aromatic compound that burning green wood produced and that damp wood produced more strongly because the moisture delayed combustion and the delayed combustion released more complex volatile compounds and the compounds entered the olfactory system and the olfactory system connected to the memory system and the memory system —

"I was there," Xu Ran said. "Not close. Half a li. But I saw it."

The words were background. The smell was foreground.

"The boy fought at the front." His voice: level. Factual. The specific tone of someone delivering a report rather than a eulogy. "I'd heard about the settlement — rumors, mostly. A cultivator protecting civilians. Unusual enough to track. I arrived the morning it happened."

He paused. Wrote something. Continued.

"He was good. Better than he should have been, with that core. He moved like someone who had been trained by someone who understood movement at a level that most cultivators never reach. His footwork was — " He stopped. "Efficient. I'll say efficient."

Efficient. Wei's barefoot efficiency. The specific martial grace that I had taught him without teaching him, that he had absorbed the way he absorbed everything — stubbornly, incompletely, with the particular imperfection that made it his rather than mine.

"He killed one of them. Not cleanly — he never would have. His cultivation wasn't at that level. But he killed one, and the other two adjusted, and the adjustment was the beginning of the end."

The smoke drifted. The smell continued. Damp wood. Green wood. The specific combination that existed also in the memory of a different fire, a different season, a hut with a low ceiling where —

"The light came from the west. Something — I didn't understand it then. Something enormous. A presence. It distracted them. Two, maybe three breaths."

The Immortal+ on the western hill. The two-finger salute. The distraction I had manufactured to buy time that wasn't enough.

"Then the attack with three fronts. Fire first. Civilians second. Then a third — a scout, through where the boy had been holding the line. He'd moved to help with the fire. The gap was there."

The specific syntax of military failure. The gap. The sequence. The exploitable absence that existed because Wei was the kind of person who moved toward the fire rather than held the line and the moving-toward was the compassion and the compassion was the vulnerability and the vulnerability was the gap and the gap was —

"I saw. Half a li. Nothing I could do at that distance."

Nothing anyone could do. The sentence was a kindness he didn't intend and that I didn't need. Nothing anyone could do was the category that described most of my history and the most-of was the thing and the thing was Wei standing in a gap because a child was running and a child running was the kind of thing Wei could not not respond to.

Something broke.

Not loudly. Not visibly. Not in the category of dramatic events that produced external signs. Inside. Below. In the specific stratum where the disconnection operated — the layer where wanting had been cut and eating had stopped and sleep had become optional. Below that. In the layer where facts lived.

The fact: Wei died while I was twenty seconds away. The fact: Wei died because he moved toward fire. The fact: Wei's core was already cracked and the crack was old and the old was years and the years were years near me.

The fact: I knew all of this already and hearing it from someone else's mouth — from outside, from the clinical distance that Xu Ran's perspective provided — did not change the data. It changed the data's location. It moved the data from behind glass to in front of glass. It removed the barrier between knowing and feeling and the removal was the break and the break was the thing that happened under the surface of my stillness.

My qi jolted.

Involuntary. The specific discharge that occurred when the emotional system collided with something immovable and the collision produced force. The leaves on the nearest tree — five paces away — curled. Not dramatically. The specific curl of organic material responding to a qi-pressure shift. Like paper near heat.

Xu Ran felt it. His arm hair lifted. He looked at me — the specific look of someone who had detected a change in atmospheric pressure and who understood that the change came from the person standing four body-lengths away. He opened his notebook.

He wrote. While I stood there with the break inside me and the leaves curling and the smoke smelling like the hut where I had sat with Wei and the hut was gone and Wei was gone and the smoke was just smoke —

He wrote.

No comfort. No condolence. He had told what he had seen. That was the offering. The offering was information and information was the currency and the currency was complete. He did not say he was sorry. He did not touch me. He did not perform any of the elaborate rituals that human beings performed when they wanted to indicate that another human being's pain was visible to them.

He wrote.

The break was not healing. Not grief. Not the named category that emotional frameworks provided for the process of absorbing loss. The break was a crack in the glass that the disconnection had installed — the barrier that kept wanting and eating and sleeping on one side and the body on the other. The crack was small. A line. Not enough to shatter. Enough to let sound through.

Wei fighting at the front. Wei moving toward fire. Wei's core cracking in a gap that existed because he moved toward a child. Sound, through the crack. Not words. Not memory. Frequency. The specific vibration of a truth that had been sealed behind glass and that was now audible through the fissure and the truth was:

He deserved to live. More than I did. And whatever I am — the thing that survives, the thing that regenerates, the thing that produces death in a three-pace radius and cannot produce death in itself — that thing should have been his.

The smoke shifted. The fire dimmed. Xu Ran closed his notebook.

The memory came.

Not Wei. Not this time — the connection fired sideways, the way memory connections fired when the direct path was too loaded, when the system rerouted to avoid the overloaded node. The trigger: the smoke. The destination: different.

A woman. Eight hundred years ago. Or close to that — the timeline was approximation, the way all timelines became approximation after the first millennium. A woman who lived in a house near a river in a province that no longer existed under that name. She had taken me in the way people sometimes took in travelers — with the practical hospitality that characterized rural communities, the specific generosity that required nothing in return except the traveler's eventual departure.

She cooked for me. Rice. Vegetables from a garden. The specific meals that reflected seasonal availability and limited resources and the skill of someone who had cooked for decades and who understood what heat did to starch and what salt did to greens and what patience did to both.

I stayed three months. The longest I had stayed anywhere in that century. The specific duration that indicated something beyond convenience — something approaching the category that other people called home, that I called the temporary cessation of movement.

She developed a cough. Week three. The specific cough that indicated respiratory involvement — deep, productive, the kind that worsened at night and that I recognized because I had seen it in populations throughout recorded history. Treatable. Easily. A specific qi-manipulation that directed warmth to the inflamed tissue and that I had performed hundreds of times.

I noticed it. I did not treat it. The reason — I could not reconstruct the reason. The memory provided no reason. Only fact: she coughed. I noticed. I did nothing. The nothing stretched — week three to week five to week seven — and the coughing worsened and the worsening was the specific progression that untreated conditions followed and the progression was predictable and the predictability was the thing I knew and did not act on.

She died at the end of the third month. In her house. Near her river. In the specific manner of someone whose respiratory system had failed gradually and who had been conscious for the failure and who had been hosted by an immortal who could have prevented it and who hadn't.

I did not know why. Then or now. The memory did not include the explanatory framework that justified the inaction. Only the inaction itself, burned into the sequence like a step in a process that I had followed without understanding the process.

The pattern. The specific, recurring pattern: proximity, attachment, failure, loss. The woman eight hundred years ago. Wei, months ago. Others. The same architecture. The same result.

The smoke had died to embers. Xu Ran slept. His breathing: even, the specific rhythm of someone who slept the way he did everything else — efficiently, without waste, in the allocated interval.

I stood. The break inside: still cracked. The sound through the fissure: still audible. The memory: still present, in the space that memory occupied when it was not being suppressed and the suppression had a crack in it and the crack was the thing that Xu Ran's words had produced and the words were just facts and the facts were the most destructive thing available.

Morning would come. He would write. I would stand.

The pattern would continue.
