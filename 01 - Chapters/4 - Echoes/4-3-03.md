# Chapter 20

"That path wasn't there yesterday."

Xu Ran said this the next morning, over the fire, with the specific tone of someone who had spent the night processing and whose processing had produced a conclusion and whose conclusion he was now delivering with the forced calm that characterized his approach to things he didn't understand.

"Then you weren't looking," I said.

The lie was clean. Automatic. The specific shape of a denial that the mouth produced without the mind's approval, the way the body healed without the mind's direction. I lied because the lie was the correct response and the correctness was social rather than factual — the correct response to an observation that threatened the structure of reality was denial, the way the correct response to a crack in a wall was plaster.

He knew I was lying. The specific compression of his features — the not-smile that indicated processing-plus-amusement — told me he knew. He wrote in his notebook. Then he tried something.

"There should be a bridge here," he said.

He said it to the stream we were crossing — a shallow stream, ankle-deep, the kind that did not require a bridge but that a bridge would make more convenient. He said it with the specific intonation of someone performing an experiment, the deliberate application of a hypothesis to a test condition.

Nothing happened. The stream remained a stream. The banks remained bridgeless. The specific absence of a bridge was the same absence that had existed before he spoke and that continued to exist after he spoke and the continuing was the result.

He shrugged. "Worth testing."

I said nothing.

But I was annoyed.

The annoyance was specific — not at his failure but at his attempt. At the presumption that the thing that had happened with the path was replicable by anyone, at the implicit assumption that whatever mechanism had produced the retroactive path was a technique rather than a condition, something to be tested rather than — 

Frustrated. I was frustrated. At his testing and at the stream and at the fact that we were ankle-deep in cold water because there was no bridge and there should have been a bridge because we had been walking for days and the walking produced the specific accumulated irritation that was distinguishable from the background numbness and the irritation was: this should be easier.

Minutes later — we were through the stream, climbing the far bank, Xu Ran wringing water from his lower robes because his broken core didn't deflect moisture the way mine did — a path appeared.

Not where the stream was. Ahead. Through a dense section of undergrowth that should have required detour. A path. Narrow. Old-looking. The specific retroactive presentation — worn edges, compressed earth, growth patterns that indicated years of existence.

On the path: a cairn.

Three flat stones. Stacked. Mossy. The specific kind of trail-marker that travelers built at intersections to indicate direction, the navigational shorthand that had existed for millennia. Three stones. Moss. Old.

The moss was real. I could feel it from here — the specific biological signatures of established growth, of organism-on-stone that had been accumulating for years. The moss was years old. The stones were years old. The cairn was years old.

The path had not existed ten minutes ago.

Xu Ran stopped. He stared at the cairn. His face — I looked at his face, for the first time deliberately since his arrival — was pale. Not afraid. Not confused. Pale in the way of someone whose understanding of the world had just been revised by evidence he could not deny and whose revision was physiological before it was intellectual.

He opened the notebook. The pen moved. Fast. Three pages in four minutes, the specific density of someone capturing an observation before the observation could be questioned, before the mind could intervene with explanations that were more comfortable than the truth.

He wrote because writing was proof. If it was written, it was real. If it was real, it was not imagined. The cairn was written. The cairn was real.

"It's tied to you," he said. Not a question. "The trees. The shadows. The paths. They're tied to your frustration."

I did not confirm. I did not deny. I stood on the path that was years old and minutes old and looked at the cairn that was moss-covered and new and the looking was the confirmation that I did not vocalize.

"Not your wishes," he said, writing. "Your frustration. I wished for a bridge. Nothing. You were frustrated about the walk. Path." He looked up. "Is that correct?"

The analytical precision was — I recognized it. The specific methodology of someone who separated variables, isolated triggers, correlated inputs with outputs. He was doing science. To me. To the reality that I apparently produced when I was sufficiently irritated.

"I don't know what that is," I said.

True. Not a lie. The path, the cairn, the retroactive insertion of geography into a timeline that had already happened — I did not have a framework for this. I had frameworks for most things. Millennia of frameworks. This was outside all of them.

"But it happened," he said.

I said nothing.

He looked at the cairn one more time. Then he touched it — his hand on the mossy surface, the specific tactile verification that confirmed solidity and temperature and the physical reality of an object that should not exist in the timeline it claimed to have existed in.

The moss was real under his fingers. The stone was cold. The path was worn.

"I'm going to document everything from now on," he said. "Every anomaly. Every path. Everything."

"You already document everything."

"More."

He closed the notebook. We walked. On the path that was old and new and that both of us knew was both and neither and the knowing was the shared truth that we did not discuss and the not-discussing was the agreement and the agreement was: this happened. We know. We continue.

The cairn remained behind us. Three stones. Mossy. Years old. Minutes old. Real in a way that expanded the definition of real.

The forest absorbed us. Behind us: the evidence. Ahead: the question of what else was possible when the person doing the walking was the kind of person whose frustration edited geography.

The question was not mine. The question was his. I had the frustration. He had the question. The division of labor was established the way all divisions were established between us — without discussion, without agreement, through the specific natural sorting that occurred when two people with complementary deficiencies walked the same path.

He had questions. I had answers I didn't want.

The path continued.
