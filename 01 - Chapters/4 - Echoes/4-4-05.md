# Chapter 30

The cold was the trigger. In the joints. In the specific deep-tissue locations that the substrate's withdrawal had left temperature-depleted. The cold in the joints and the cold triggered the memory system and the memory system connected and the connection produced:

Wei.

Not a controlled memory. Not the deliberate access of a stored experience that the memory system provided on request. The memory arrived the way memories arrived when the trigger was bodily rather than cognitive — fully formed, sensory-complete, installed in the perception as if the perception were experiencing it now.

Wei, on a night. Cold. The specific cold of the mountain settlement in the wet season, the kind that entered buildings through gaps in the walls and that compressed the living space into the area nearest the fire and that made fire itself seem insufficient.

He had asked a question.

This was characteristic — Wei asked questions the way other children performed tasks: by assignment. He had decided that tonight was a question-night and the question was the kind that fourteen-year-old boys who had been trained by immortals asked when they had accumulated enough observation to formulate something that exceeded their apparent capacity.

"What was the worst thing that ever happened to you?"

His voice. The specific register — deeper than a child's, not quite an adult's. The in-between voice. The voice that had been changing for months and that produced the particular tonal quality that indicated the biological transition from boy to young man. I remembered the voice because the voice was the sensory anchor and the anchor was the thing that the memory attached to.

I had considered the question. The worst thing. The category implied comparison — the ranking of negative experiences on a scale that produced a maximum. The worst. The superlative that required the thing to exceed all other things in its category.

I had responded.

"Waking up tomorrow."

Six syllables. The specific compression that I applied to truths that were large — compressing them into small containers so that the container could be handed to someone without the weight of the content being immediately apparent. Waking up tomorrow. Meaning: every morning, for millennia, the specific act of resuming consciousness after the interval of rest that I occasionally permitted, was the worst thing. Because every morning was the confirmation that it continued. That I continued. That the specific existential condition that I occupied — the un-dying, the perpetual, the structural violation of mortality — resumed.

He laughed.

Not the laugh of someone who found the answer funny. The laugh of someone who had expected something grand — an event, a battle, a catastrophe, a named historical trauma — and who had received instead a domestic observation. He laughed because the scale was wrong. The scale of his expectation and the scale of my answer did not match and the mismatch was the humor and the humor was his.

I did not laugh. The answer was not humorous. The answer was the specific truth that I had compressed and that the compression made portable and the portability made transferable and the transfer did not include the weight. He received the container. He did not feel the content. He laughed.

The memory closed. The cold in the joints warmed. The sensory anchor released.

I was climbing. The cliff wall — grey stone, sedimentary, the specific geology that I had studied during the descent and that I was now studying from the reversed perspective, ascending. My hands on the rock. My feet finding purchase. The body doing the thing the body did — efficiently, without fatigue, without the specific physical limitations that climbing imposed on bodies that operated in the standard configuration.

The memory's content was present. In the climbing. In the joints. In the specific cognitive space that the memory occupied after the memory itself had concluded.

Waking up tomorrow. The worst thing.

And now — at the bottom of an eight-hundred-meter cliff that I had survived because something inside me had decided I would survive — now the answer had a different meaning.

Not different facts. The same facts. Waking up tomorrow was still the worst thing. The specific resumption of consciousness, the daily confirmation of un-dying, the structural perpetuity that the substrate maintained regardless of my participation — all of this was still the worst thing.

But the relationship to the worst thing had changed.

Before the cliff: waking up tomorrow was the worst thing and the worst-thing-ness was the burden and the burden was the passive load that existence placed on the shoulders that carried it. Before the cliff: I woke up because I could not not wake up. The waking was compulsory. The waking was structural.

After the cliff: waking up tomorrow was still the worst thing. But the worst thing was now the thing I chose to investigate rather than the thing I chose to endure.

The difference was: agency.

Not free agency — not the liberation from the structural perpetuity that the substrate imposed. I would still wake up. The substrate would still maintain. The un-dying would continue. But the consciousness that woke up — the mind that resumed, the Yun that opened her eyes to the next morning — that consciousness now had a project. An investigation. A question.

What am I.

The question did not make the worst thing less worst. The question made the worst thing purposeful. And purpose was the thing that the grey weeks had lacked and the lacking had been the condition and the condition was: transformed. Not healed. Transformed. The way a wound that healed wrong was transformed by breaking it again and setting it correctly — the pain was still pain but the direction of the healing was different.

I climbed. The cliff provided handholds. My body used them.

Wei had laughed. The laugh was in the memory and the memory was in me and the in-me-ness of Wei's laugh was a specific kind of pain that the cliff-shift did not address because the cliff-shift addressed the question of what-I-was and not the question of why-he-died and the two questions were related but not identical and the not-identical meant: one answer would not serve both questions.

But one answer was more than zero answers.

And zero was what I had had in the forest. Zero purposes. Zero directions. Zero reasons to wake up tomorrow except the structural compulsion of the substrate.

Now I had one.

One was enough.

The cliff's top was approaching. The eight hundred meters of ascending stone that the body was traversing with the efficient automatism that characterized all physical tasks performed by a body that did not fatigue. The top was up and up was where Xu Ran was and Xu Ran was the thing that I was climbing toward not because I wanted him but because above was the direction and above was where the investigation would require me to go and going required: starting.

My hands reached the edge. The same edge that my toes had extended past. The same edge that I had stepped off with let's see as my only thought.

I pulled myself up.

Standing. At the top. The wind had resumed — the specific atmospheric motion that had ceased during the silence before the fall. The wind was back. The world was back. Sound was back. The specific background audio of an alive landscape — insects, birds, the distant movement of things that moved — was present.

I stood at the edge of the cliff I had jumped off and the standing was the same and different and the difference was inside and the inside was where the answer was.
