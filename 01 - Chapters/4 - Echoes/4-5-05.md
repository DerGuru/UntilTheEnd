# Chapter 37

He wrote faster now.

Not faster in the sense of rushed — faster in the sense of urgent. The specific increase in writing velocity that occurred when the writer understood that the record was no longer optional but necessary, that the documentation was no longer academic but operational, that the notebook was no longer his project but her lifeline.

He wrote before I spoke. He wrote during speech. He wrote after, filling the gaps that the speech had not covered, adding observations that the speech had not included: her posture, her expression, the specific behavioral markers that her words did not contain. He wrote as if he were constructing a second person from text — a backup Yun, a documented Yun, a Yun-on-paper who would exist even if the Yun-in-person forgot.

"Three eggs and the leftover rice," he said, at the fire, on a morning that followed a night that I mostly remembered.

"When did I say that?"

He showed me the notebook. Third entry from the top. The date. The time. My words: three eggs and the leftover rice.

I had asked for breakfast. Specifically. With a preference. Three eggs and the leftover rice — the specific request of someone who detected hunger and articulated it and the articulation was: food-preference. Show-indicator number one: shifting. Not fully restored — not the reliable hunger-detection that functional organisms performed. But present. Intermittent.

I did not remember asking.

This was the pattern. Not consistent erasure — selected erasure. The memories that disappeared were the memories that connected to the investigation, to the substrate, to the specific cognitive territory that the self-protection targeted. Other memories remained: I remembered his meditation from last night (still loud, still irritating, still the specific acoustic warfare that constituted his evening procedure). I remembered the conversation about terrain at dinner. I remembered the argument about ginger.

The investigation-adjacent memories: gone. The substrate had edited them. The substrate edited them with the precision of a surgeon removing specific tissue while leaving the surrounding structures intact.

Xu Ran was my memory now. Not metaphorically — operationally. His notebook contained the record that my mind no longer reliably maintained. His pages contained the thoughts I had thought and forgotten and would think again and might forget again. He was the external hard drive that the failing internal system required.

He adapted.

The notebook entries changed format. Previous entries: observational. His perspective. His analysis. "Subject reports vibration." "Subject spoke eleven words." "Subject shows behavioral markers consistent with —"

New entries: instructional. My perspective. My words, quoted exactly. The format of someone who was writing not for his own reference but for the reader who would need the content to reconstruct herself.

"Read this every morning," he had written. At the top of a new section. In handwriting that was deliberately larger than his usual miniature — readable at first glance, without squinting, without the effort that his normal notation required.

The section contained: what we were doing. What we had found. What I had concluded. The specific summary that a patient might need upon waking from a procedure that had erased short-term memory. The clinical briefing that restored operational awareness.

He had turned his notebook into my morning briefing.

This was — I noticed this, and the noticing was the specific cognitive event that preceded the emotional response that the cognitive event produced — this was careful. Not generous. Not kind. Not the performed-compassion that people offered when they wanted credit for caring. Careful. The precision of someone who recognized a structural problem and implemented a structural solution and the solution was: paper.

He was also paranoid.

This I noticed over days — the specific accumulation of behavioral changes that indicated a shift in his baseline anxiety. He looked behind us. Not often — not the dramatic backward-glancing of someone expecting pursuit. Intermittently. The specific frequency of head-turns that indicated background monitoring, the passive surveillance that someone performed when they were aware of a threat that they were not discussing.

His handwriting, when he noticed me watching, steadied. The deliberate correction that indicated the shake was present when he was unobserved and absent when he was observed and the disparity was control — the visible manifestation of someone managing the visibility of his fear.

Something had happened.

I did not know what. The memory gap covered the relevant period — the crater, the qi-anomaly, the interval in which something had occurred that I could not access. Something had happened to him during my investigation and the something had changed his behavior and the changed behavior was: fear. Not of me. Not of the substrate. Fear of something external. Something he had encountered while I was occupied with the crater and while I was subsequently emptied of the memory of the crater.

"Are you alright?" I asked.

The question surprised us both. Not the content — the asking. The specific social behavior that concern produced in organisms whose concern was functional. I had asked if he was alright. The asking required: the detection of another person's state, the comparison of that state with a baseline, the identification of deviation, and the articulation of inquiry. Four cognitive steps that the disconnection had prevented and that the cliff-shift had partially restored and that the memory gaps had not yet erased.

"Fine," he said. The lie was the same shape as mine: small, necessary, protective. The kind that people told when the truth was large and the largeness would change the conversation and the conversation-changing was something neither party could afford.

He wrote. I watched him write. The watching was the specific observation of someone who understood that the person writing was the only reliable record of her own existence and that the record was being maintained by hands that shook when no one was looking.

We continued. He wrote. I forgot. He reminded. I continued. The cycle had established itself — the specific feedback loop that dependent systems produced when one system's failure was compensated for by another system's function.

He compensated. I failed. He compensated. I failed.

The dependency was not comfortable. The dependency was the specific discomfort of someone whose self-sufficiency had been the organizing principle of ten thousand years and whose self-sufficiency was now conditional on a broken-core researcher with a notebook and a pen and a fear he wouldn't name.

But the dependency was functional.

And functional was more than I had managed alone.
