# Chapter 31

Xu Ran was at the camp. Twenty paces from the cliff's edge. His pack on the ground. His notebook in his hands.

He had seen it.

His face told the story before his mouth could. The face was the wrong color. Not fear-pale — something permanent. The kind that meant: this changes things.

"What," he said. Then stopped. The sentence had not continued because continuing required language adequate to the phenomenon and the phenomenon had no adequate language.

He tried again.

"What was that?"

Three words. The same three words he had asked at other moments of anomaly — the branches, the path, the pulsing. But the delivery was different. The branches-voice had been curious. The path-voice had been analytical. The pulsing-voice had been watchful.

This voice was shattered.

He had watched a person step off an eight-hundred-meter cliff. He had watched the fall — seconds he could not have counted but could estimate from the visual of a human body diminishing against grey stone. He had watched the fall stop. The floating. The settling. The standing-at-the-bottom.

His notebook was open and the pages were — I could see from here — half-filled with writing that was worse than his usual miniature precision. Larger. Uneven. The handwriting of hands that were unsteady because their owner's reality had been revised.

His hand was still shaking. The pen trembled against the page.

"You jumped," he said.

"Yes."

"Eight hundred meters."

"Approximately."

The word hung. I let it.

"You're standing here."

"Yes."

The asymmetry was the scene. He was shattered and I was calm and the calm was new. The old calm had been disconnection — the not-caring, the stillness that emptiness produced. This calm was the presence of something. Resolution. A mind that had found a question to replace a void, and the question was a better occupant.

He wrote. The pen moving in the shaking rhythm. His hand: unsteady. His breathing: irregular, his body still running the threat-response the cliff-jump had triggered.

"How," he said.

I looked at him. The looking was deliberate — directed, intentional. I looked at Xu Ran and the looking was: honest.

"I don't know," I said. "Not yet."

The not-yet was mine. The same not-yet that he used — the word that contained the assumption of eventual understanding. I had borrowed his word. Or the word had migrated, the way words migrated between people who spent enough time in proximity. Not yet. Currently unresolved but resolvable.

He closed the notebook. His hand was still shaking. He put the notebook in his pack — done writing, not because the data was complete but because the data was too large for the hand to hold.

Evening came. He built a fire. He cooked. The standard procedure — the ginger, the rice, the scratched pot on the stones. The routine was his anchor.

He meditated. Louder than usual — the volume increase that indicated the noise-need had intensified. The mantras were faster. The humming more insistent. The breathing was theatrical in the way that desperation made things theatrical.

I sat at six paces. The fire between us. His meditation filling the space with the sound I had complained about and endured and complained about again and that was now —

I knew the rhythm.

The rise and fall. The contour that was not melody but resembled it. The sequence that repeated every forty seconds. I knew it. Not from study. From exposure. From twenty-three nights of the ten-pace distance that had installed the pattern in my memory without my memory requesting the installation.

I knew when his breathing would deepen. I knew when the mantra would conclude and the humming would bridge. I knew when the humming would accelerate and the next mantra would begin.

The immortal who didn't care had accidentally memorized a stranger's meditation schedule. This was either the most pathetic thing that had happened in my existence or the second most pathetic, the first being that I noticed I had done it.

I noticed that I knew.

The noticing said: something in me still learned. Still absorbed. Still converted proximity into knowledge and knowledge into —

Not comfort. Not yet. Familiarity. Not attachment. Not yet. But not indifference either. The knowledge that this sound came next and the knowledge that the sound's coming-next was: expected.

I expected.

Expected. As in: anticipated. The future contained a predictable element and the predictable was: his meditation rhythm. The future contained something I knew about before it happened and the knowing-before was —

Not hope. Not yet. Just: expectation. The first stirring of a mind that had decided the future was a space that contained things rather than a space that was empty.

He meditated. I expected. The rhythm continued. The fire burned. The night was cold and the cold was external and the internal was: one degree warmer than before.

He slept, eventually. The silence returned. The Xu-Ran-shaped hole in the silence that I had noticed before was still there.

I sat in the silence. In the hole. In the one-degree-warmer-than-before.

The humming beneath my ribs continued. The substrate breathing. The echo.
