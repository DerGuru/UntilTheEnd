# Chapter 2

The body stood.

Not a decision. The body stood because the body had something older than will — the reflex that said: enough sitting. Stillness was the interruption. The interruption had ended.

I walked.

The path — there was a path. Left of the oak, through the undergrowth, a line worn into the forest floor by repetition. Animal, probably. Deer, or whatever else had traveled the same route for long enough to leave evidence.

I followed it. Not because left was better than right. Because left was where the path was, and direction was the only thing the body still required.

The brown circle moved with me. Three paces. Grass behind me: dead. Grass ahead: alive until I arrived, then dying, then dead. Not footprints — the opposite of footprints. Where I walked, the world subtracted.

Trees. Large. Their trunks within the radius: bark drying, leaves losing rigidity. Outside: fine. Green. The boundary moved as I moved — sharp, clean, the border between the livable and everything I touched.

I walked.

Day shifted. The light changed angles. Afternoon became something else. The temperature dropped. I noticed.

A berry. On a branch. Different bush than yesterday's, same color. My hand stayed at my side. Not refusal — the hand simply didn't know about the berry. The hand knew about swinging, about balance. Not about reaching.

I passed the berry. It stayed red. I stayed walking.

Night arrived. Not fell — arrived. The forest kind: gradual, the light withdrawing in layers, the canopy filtering sunset into rumor and rumor into dark.

I walked.

Not through the night as an act of endurance. Through the night because stopping required a decision, and decisions were the thing that had left. My legs operated. The path continued.

Stars. Visible through the canopy in patches. I did not count them. Counting was a kind of caring.

A sound. Close. Feathers adjusting. Wings.

A bird. On the branch beside me — small, dark, close enough that the ants would have diverted. Its head turned. Small eyes, bright. Looking at me without deciding what I was.

It twitched. The full-body shudder, every feather at once. Then gone — up, away, fast.

Two seconds. Total.

The first living thing to come close in — however long this was. Two seconds. Same conclusion as everything else: not here.

I walked.

Past the branch where it had been. Past the berry. Past the trees whose bark dried and recovered in my wake.

The brown circle, constant. The forest, infinite.

And the bird, gone.
