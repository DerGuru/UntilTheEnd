# Chapter 26

Xu Ran was afraid of me.

Not the way he'd been afraid before — the intellectual cautiousness of a man who understood power differentials and maintained appropriate respect for natural law. This was new. This was the deeper thing, the thing that lived beneath analysis and reason and the scholarly habit of categorizing danger before experiencing it.

I saw it in the way he handed me the rice bowl at dinner. The pause — fractional, almost invisible, the hesitation of a hand that knew it was reaching toward something that might react. He caught himself. Completed the gesture. The bowl changed hands. Rice. Normal. The most ordinary exchange in the history of traveling together.

But the pause had been there.

And I'd seen it.

"You're afraid," I said.

He ate. Chewed. Swallowed. The deliberateness of someone composing a response.

"Yes."

No deflection. No qualification. No scholarly reframing that turned fear into observation. Just the word, clean and bare, placed between us like the sect woman's paper on the rock.

"Since when?"

"Since the trees." He set his bowl down. "The rain — that was grief. I could stand in that. Standing in someone's grief is not comfortable, but it is comprehensible. Grief is human." He looked at the fire. "Splitting three trees from the inside with a thought is not."

I wanted to argue. The instinct was there — automatically, defensively, the same reflex that made me rub my temples and clench my fists and tell myself that whatever was happening was manageable, controllable, something that could be understood and therefore mastered.

But I'd split three trees with anger I hadn't aimed. Had made it rain from a clear sky. Had made the earth move because I was frustrated about scrolls. Each escalation had been larger, less controlled, more directly tied to the thing inside me that didn't ask permission before it acted.

"I'm afraid of me too," I said.

He looked up. Something shifted in his expression — not relief, not comfort, something more structural. As if my admission had rearranged a calculation he'd been running, had introduced a variable that changed the outcome from *doesn't know* to *knows and it doesn't help.*

Which was worse, probably. But at least it was honest.

We broke camp before dawn. Moving was better than sitting. Sitting invited thinking, and thinking invited the kind of internal pressure that manifested as force.

The trail should have taken us south. We'd studied the map — Xu Ran's map, annotated in his careful hand with the route changes and path corrections that the world kept making. South, toward lower elevations, toward the river valley where other people lived and where the effect I had on things might be diluted by distance and diffusion and the simple arithmetic of being surrounded by enough normal reality to absorb the abnormal.

But the trail didn't go south.

It had, yesterday. He'd checked. I'd watched him check. South, clearly marked, cutting between two ridges toward the valley floor. This morning, the trail went east. Into the mountains. Toward higher ground, thinner air, less life, less buffer, more isolation.

"The path changed," Xu Ran said. Flat. Not surprised. Beyond surprise, now, in the territory where anomaly was simply the operating condition.

I looked at the trail. East. Into the mountains. Into the place where my emotions would have fewer things to break and more empty space to fill.

I hadn't wanted to go east. I hadn't consciously redirected anything. But the part of me that operated without consultation — the part that forgot things, that healed things, that split things, that made weather — had apparently decided that proximity to people was a variable to be minimized.

Self-protection. Again. Always.

"We go south," I said. "Off-trail."

We went south. Off-trail. Through undergrowth that hadn't been walked and over terrain that hadn't been crossed and around obstacles that nobody had bothered to clear because nobody had ever needed this route before.

An hour later, we found a trail.

Going east.

Xu Ran stopped. Looked at the trail. Looked at me. His jaw worked — the motion of someone biting down on something they wanted to say, chewing it, deciding whether to swallow or spit.

"You're doing this," he said.

"I'm not — I don't want to go east."

"What you want and what's happening appear to be different categories."

He was right. And that — the gap between my conscious intention and the world's response — was the thing that scared me more than the trees, more than the rain, more than the earthquake. I could survive being powerful. I could possibly survive being destructive. But surviving being out of control — being a force that acted according to rules I couldn't read and didn't remember writing — that was the thing that sat in my stomach like cold iron and wouldn't dissolve.

We tried south three more times. Each time, the terrain funneled us. Not violently — no walls, no barriers, no dramatic geological intervention. Just the gentle persuasion of a landscape that kept offering east as the path of least resistance and making south increasingly difficult. A ravine here. A landslide there. A thicket of thorn-brush so dense that even qi-enhanced cutting would take hours.

By afternoon, we were going east.

I hadn't decided to go east. The world had decided for me. Or — the part of me that was becoming the world had decided for both of us, and the distinction between me deciding and the world deciding was eroding with every hour, every tremor, every branch that snapped in still air.

"The sect knows," I said. We'd stopped at a stream. The water was cold and clear and tasted of minerals and the metallic aftertaste that mountain water carries when it runs through old stone. "They've been tracking me. They'll know where we are."

"Yes."

"And they'll follow."

"Also yes."

I drank. The water tasted wrong. Not poisoned-wrong, not contaminated-wrong, but wrong in the way that things tasted wrong since the night I'd forgotten three things — slightly off, slightly distant, as if the experience of tasting was being relayed through one too many intermediaries.

"We could separate," I said.

Xu Ran refilled his flask. Capped it. Secured it.

"No," he said.

"You'd be safer."

"Probably."

"You'd be invisible. Mortal. Nobody would—"

"No."

Not angry. Not defiant. Not the dramatic declaration of loyalty that stories are made of. Just refusal. Quiet, absolute, the kind that doesn't need reasons because the reasons are so fundamental they exist below the level of articulation.

I rubbed my temples. The headache was worse. It had been worse every day since the forgetting, a low persistent pressure that spiked when I tried to think about what I'd lost and settled to a dull roar when I stopped trying. My eyes ached. My jaw was tight. The muscles at the base of my skull were knotted into something that would have required professional intervention in a world where professional intervention existed.

"I had a dream last night," I said.

Xu Ran looked at me. Waiting.

"I don't remember it. But I woke up and there was frost on the ground in a circle around me. Just around me. Your bedroll was dry."

"I noticed."

"You didn't mention it."

"You had enough to process."

I looked at the stream. The water ran clear over smooth stones, catching light, breaking it into the kind of scattered brightness that means nothing and contains nothing and is still, somehow, the most honest thing in any landscape. Water going somewhere. Not deciding where. Just going.

"I'm the most dangerous thing in these mountains," I said. It wasn't self-pity. It wasn't drama. It was the same kind of statement that *fire is hot* is — categorical, factual, the kind of truth that exists whether or not anyone acknowledges it.

"I know," Xu Ran said. He put his flask away. Adjusted his pack. "We should keep moving. East, apparently." The corner of his mouth did something that might have been humor if it hadn't been so thin.

We walked east.

The mountains received us the way mountains receive everything — with the patient indifference of things that have existed for longer than the concept of hospitality. The air thinned. The vegetation thinned. The world opened up into the kind of high-altitude emptiness where sound carries too far and shadows fall too sharp and everything feels slightly unreal, slightly provisional, as if the landscape is a draft that hasn't been finalized.

I walked. He walked behind me. The distance between us was three meters — the same distance he'd always maintained, give or take, the natural spacing of two people who trust each other enough to not need proximity and not enough to not need distance.

But three meters felt different now.

Three meters used to be companionship.

Now it was range.
