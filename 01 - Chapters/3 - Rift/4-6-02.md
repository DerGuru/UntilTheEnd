# Chapter 44

The clearing was adequate.

Morning light arrived through the canopy gap — the kind of light that found open ground wherever trees had fallen. The clearing was forty paces across. Flat. Compacted earth, sparse grass. Good visibility. Good footing.

I stood in the center. Xu Ran stood at ten paces.

The phial was in my hand. Ceramic. Warm. The wax seal intact. The weight of two mouthfuls. Ninety seconds to dissolve immortality.

I looked at Xu Ran. He was holding his notebook — the first one, the personal one. The brush was wet. Weight forward, eyes moving — the posture of someone recording, not participating.

"Ready?" I asked.

He did not answer with a word. He raised the brush slightly. The gesture meant: proceed.

I broke the seal. The wax crumbled. Fragments fell to the compacted earth. The phial was open. No smell. The nothing-smell of something designed to go unnoticed.

I drank.

One motion. The phial to the lips. The tilt. The liquid — thin, the consistency of water, the temperature of ambient — entered my mouth and I swallowed and the ceramic was empty.

The clearing held its features. The light. The trees at thirty paces. Xu Ran at ten. The phial in my hand, empty.

I waited.

The waiting was the experiment. The question was: how long before it responds. The cliff had been instantaneous — the fall was the threat and the response was the stop and the interval was: none. Zero. The mechanics of reflexive protection. But the poison was different. The poison was chemical, not physical. The threat was internal, not external. The threat arrived through the blood, not through gravity.

I waited.

Five seconds. I felt: nothing. The liquid was in my stomach. The absorption process was underway. According to the scroll: absorption in fifteen seconds, onset at thirty, full meridian dissolution at forty-five, death at ninety. Efficient. Someone had put real craftsmanship into this.

Ten seconds.

Xu Ran's brush moved. He was writing. Fast. The shorthand of someone writing against a clock.

Fifteen seconds. The absorption should be complete.

Twenty seconds.

I felt it.

The onset was not what I expected. The scroll had described burning — the meridians responding to the compound's approach the way nerve endings responded to acid. Burning. Progressive. Peripheral to central.

What I felt was: cold.

Not the cold of temperature. The cold of absence. The cold of something being taken. The way a missing limb feels cold — not because the temperature dropped, but because the warmth left with it. Something was being eaten. The Shadow-Eater was eating. And the eating felt like cold because the thing being eaten had been warm and its absence was: nothing.

The peripheral channels.

I felt them go. The minor meridians in my fingers, my toes, the fine capillary network that cultivation produced in the extremities of Immortal-level practitioners. They went. One by one. Not pain — absence. Cold absence. Something being dismantled from the edges inward.

Twenty-five seconds.

"Fingers," I said. Flat. Clinical. The observational report that the experiment required. "The peripheral channels are dissolving."

Xu Ran wrote.

Thirty seconds. The secondary channels. The major meridians in my arms and legs. The compound was progressing inward. On schedule. The scroll's timeline was accurate. The poison performed as designed.

I watched myself die. From the edges. The qi-structure that had been part of my body for longer than I could remember was being removed. Layer by layer. Channel by channel. The Shadow-Eater ate, and the eating was silent and cold and systematic.

Cold. So cold. The cold of losing something so old it had become indistinguishable from self.

The primary channels.

Thirty-five seconds. The large meridians. The central architecture. The load-bearing structure that held my immortal body together. The Shadow-Eater reached them and began.

I felt it. The beginning of structural failure. Not pain. Worse. The sensation of becoming: less. The architecture was dissolving and the body that depended on the architecture was beginning to follow and the beginning was: this.

Forty seconds.

The dantian.

The compound reached my core. The center. The place where the qi-structure originated, where the entire meridian network converged, where the power that had kept me alive for millennia resided.

The Shadow-Eater began to eat.

And then —
