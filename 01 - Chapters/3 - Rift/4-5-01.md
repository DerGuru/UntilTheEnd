# Chapter 33

The search had a direction.

Not a map. A direction. Internal. The compass that the cliff had calibrated pointing inward, and the inward producing a trajectory that expressed itself geographically as: there. And there. And there.

Old places. The places where I had died without dying. The places where the substrate had intervened before I knew it existed, before the question had a name.

"What are we looking for?" Xu Ran asked, on the second day of the search.

"Traces."

He wrote it down. The notebook: always open. The pen: always moving.

I walked faster.

Xu Ran noticed. His broken core limited his physical capacity in ways mine was not limited. The ten paces sometimes stretched to twelve. To fifteen. He did not complain. He walked.

The terrain shifted. We descended from the mountain foothills into the river provinces — lowland, cultivated, terrain that human civilization had domesticated over centuries. Roads replaced paths. Settlements became visible in the distance.

We avoided the settlements. The death-radius — three paces, constant — was not compatible with populated areas.

"We could resupply," Xu Ran said. He was looking at a village below the ridge. Smoke from cook-fires. The sound of a market bell.

"Not with me standing next to the rice merchant."

He adjusted his pack straps. Said nothing else.

A pass road, worn by commerce. We walked it because the pass road was the direction.

Near a small marketplace I saw someone.

A man. Walking the opposite direction. Alone. Ordinary clothing, ordinary stride. Cultivation base: immense. He walked south. I walked north. Neither of us slowed down.

I did not think about him again.

The direction continued. The crater was three days south.

I would think about this later, though. The man on the pass road. Not because he mattered then — he didn't. Because later he would. And I had walked right past him.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Cut 3 post-show analytical cascades — cartographic-precision definition after "direction," "this was the visible change" walking analysis, "I knew the type. I was the type" after immense cultivation base
- Added dialog: Xu Ran resupply exchange near settlements (replaces zero-dialog stretch; establishes death-radius constraint through character interaction rather than narration)
- Applied Global Patterns: Compressed "the kind of X that Y" construction on pass road; removed redundant em-dash definition
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The resupply dialog shows the death-radius cost through a concrete human moment instead of the narrator stating it as fact.
