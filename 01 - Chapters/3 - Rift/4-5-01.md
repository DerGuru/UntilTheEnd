# Chapter 33

The search had a direction.

Not a map — not the cartographic precision that Xu Ran's documents provided, with their neat lines and cardinal markers. A direction. Internal. The compass that the cliff had calibrated pointing inward, and the inward producing a trajectory that expressed itself geographically as: there. And there. And there.

Old places. The places where I had died without dying. The places where the substrate had intervened before I knew it existed, before the question had a name.

"What are we looking for?" Xu Ran asked, on the second day of the search.

"Traces."

He wrote it down. The notebook: always open. The pen: always moving.

I walked faster.

This was the visible change. Not running. The faster walking of someone who had somewhere to be. Xu Ran noticed.

His broken core limited his physical capacity in ways mine was not limited. He walked faster because I walked faster. The ten paces sometimes stretched to twelve. To fifteen. He did not complain. He walked.

The terrain shifted. We descended from the mountain foothills into the river provinces — lowland, cultivated, terrain that human civilization had domesticated over centuries. Roads replaced paths. Settlements became visible in the distance.

We avoided the settlements. The death-radius — three paces, constant — was not compatible with populated areas.

A pass road. The kind that connected provinces through mountain corridors, worn by commerce. We walked the pass road because the pass road was the direction.

Near a small marketplace I saw someone.

A man. Walking the opposite direction. Alone. Ordinary clothing, ordinary stride. Cultivation base: immense — the kind that didn't announce itself. I knew the type. I was the type. He walked south. I walked north. Neither of us slowed down.

I did not think about him again.

The direction continued. The crater was three days south.

I would think about this later, though. The man on the pass road. Not because he mattered then — he didn't. Because later he would. And I had walked right past him.
