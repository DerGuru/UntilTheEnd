# Chapter 4

The path should have led through a valley. It led through a plateau.

Not a dramatic difference — the elevation was similar, the vegetation matched, the general direction held true. But a valley is a valley. It has walls. It channels wind and water and sound in exact ways, creates its own microclimate, its own acoustic signature. A plateau does none of those things.

I stood at the edge of what should have been a descent and looked at flat ground instead.

Xu Ran stood beside me, breathing easily, doing nothing wrong. He had no memory of this place. For him, this was just terrain — another stretch of land between where we'd been and where we were going. He couldn't feel the absence of the valley the way I could, couldn't sense the ghost of topography that should have been there.

"Nice view," he said.

"Mm."

We crossed the plateau in silence. The afternoon sun was warm — too warm for this altitude, another tick on the list — and the air smelled of wild thyme crushed under our boots. A pleasant smell. A correct smell, actually. Thyme grew at this elevation. Some things were right.

I counted them because it helped. Right things, wrong things. Two columns in a ledger I kept behind my eyes. The right column was longer, which should have been comforting. A world that's mostly right is a world that's mostly functional. But a ledger with any entries in the wrong column is a ledger that should worry you.

Four days later, we reached the library.

It was exactly where I remembered it.

This surprised me more than the shifted path, more than the missing valley, more than any of the anomalies I'd catalogued so far. The library sat in its fold of the hills like a body in a coffin — precisely placed, intentionally positioned, exactly as I'd seen it last. The walls. The courtyard. The shape of the main hall's roofline, which I could trace from memory.

The roof was gone, of course. Time takes roofs before it takes walls. But the absence was the right shape — the gap where wooden beams had surrendered to rot was proportional, expected, an honest accounting of centuries passed.

I stood at the entrance and tasted chalk. Finer here — not the coarse grit of the shrine but something almost powdery, like the page-dust of books that had been crumbling in place for longer than anyone had been alive to read them. The metal fittings on the doorframe — hinges, mostly, and a latch mechanism rusted past all function — were cold. Winter-cold.

And the incense. Fainter than at the shrine, but present. Musty. Sweet. Sourceless.

"Same smell," Xu Ran said quietly. He'd noticed it at the shrine too. He didn't know what it was any more than I did, but he'd noted it in his book and apparently been waiting for a recurrence. The recurrence seemed to please him in the way that confirmed hypotheses please scholars — as evidence that the world is patterned, not arbitrary.

"Same smell," I agreed.

The library's interior was a ruin's ruin — the skeleton of a skeleton, shelves collapsed into heaps of grey wood, stone tablets cracked and scattered like oversized playing cards. Whatever texts had been stored here on perishable materials were gone. Paper doesn't survive centuries. Neither does bamboo, or silk, or skin.

Stone survives.

I spent two days there.

The first day was physical. Clearing debris, lifting fallen shelves — carefully, because the wood was brittle and the stone beneath uncertain — cataloguing what remained. Xu Ran helped. He was better at it than he would have been six months ago; the months of traveling had hardened his hands and softened his expectations of comfort. He lifted without complaining, sorted without asking why, and made notes with the systematic attention of someone who understood that understanding comes after observation, not before.

We made camp in the courtyard. Xu Ran cooked. Rice and dried vegetables, simple, competent. He'd picked up herbs along the road — I hadn't noticed, which meant he'd done it while I was walking ahead, lost in my own calculations. The food was adequate. Better than adequate. I didn't tell him that.

"The shrine had qi anomalies," he said over dinner. "This place?"

"Different."

"Different how?"

I considered how to answer. The truth was large and unwieldy, the kind of thing that doesn't fit in a sentence. The library's qi wasn't anomalous — it was layered. Strata of different ages, different characters, laid down over centuries like sediment. Most of it was normal. Historical residue from the cultivators who'd used this place, studied here, meditated in these rooms. But underneath the layers, at the very bottom, pressed into the foundation stones like fingerprints in wet clay—

Old qi. Very old. Older than the building. Older than the hill.

Similar to the shrine.

Similar to mine.

"The qi here predates the structure," I said. "Same as the shrine."

He set down his chopsticks. Carefully. "By how much?"

"Significantly."

"Can you be more exact?"

"At least twelve hundred years."

He picked up his chopsticks again. Set them down again. "The qi was here before the library was built."

"Yes."

"As if the library was built on top of it."

"Or as if the qi was placed here, and the library grew around it later. Like a pearl grows around grit."

"Placed." He tasted the word. "By whom?"

I ate a piece of radish. It was overcooked. "That's the question."

The second day was worse.

I found inscriptions on the foundation stones — not carved, not painted, but etched into the rock by qi itself. Permanent. The characters were old, a script that had been dead for longer than most civilizations had been alive, and I could read them.

One character stood apart from the rest. Cut deeper. Wider strokes, pressed with force that cracked the surrounding grain. A single word, written in the first person:

*Me.*

My qi surged — involuntary, a pulse from my dantian I hadn't willed. It spread through my palms into the stone, and the stone hummed back. Recognition, low and persistent, like a bell still ringing long after being struck.

I pulled my hands away.

That was the problem. The problem from the shrine, magnified. I could read a dead language I had never studied, recognize patterns I had never been taught, follow logic I had never encountered. The knowledge was there, fully formed, waiting patiently in the back of my mind like a servant who'd been standing in a doorway for years, unnoticed, ready to be useful.

The inscriptions were fragments. Observations. Someone — a researcher, a scholar, a cultivator-academic — had recorded anomalies. Qi flow deviations. Spatial inconsistencies. Things that didn't match their maps, their memories, their expectations.

The list I was building.

Someone had been here before. Centuries ago. Doing exactly what I was doing — measuring the wrongness, cataloguing the gaps, trying to find the pattern in the noise.

They had built this library to house their research. They had stood where I was standing — tasted chalk dust, felt cold metal under their palms, caught the ghost-scent of incense. They had asked my questions.

I sat on the floor of the main hall and pressed my palms against the stone. The inscriptions hummed under my skin — not sound, but vibration, the deep bass note of qi that has been settled into rock for so long that rock and qi have become indistinguishable.

*Who were you?*

No answer. Stone doesn't answer. But it holds. It keeps. It remembers in the way that only things without minds can remember — perfectly, without interpretation, without the editorial hand of consciousness deciding what matters and what doesn't.

The inscriptions went on. Down the walls, into the floor, beneath the rubble. More than I could catalogue in a week. A lifetime's work, compressed into stone, left here by someone who had been — like me — searching.

Unlike me, they had stopped.

The inscriptions ended. Not gradually — abruptly. Mid-sentence, mid-observation, mid-thought. Whatever had interrupted them had interrupted completely.

I stared at the final character. Half-formed. The brush-equivalent of a voice cut short.

"What happened to them?" Xu Ran asked. He was reading over my shoulder — he couldn't parse the script, but he could read my face, and whatever was on it had brought him close.

"I don't know."

"But you can guess."

I could. I didn't want to.

The chalk dust settled deeper between my teeth. The cold metal fittings watched from the doorframe like patient eyes.

I stood up.

"We need to find more sites," I said. "As many as we can."
