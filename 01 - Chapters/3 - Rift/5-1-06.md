# Chapter 6

The caves were where I remembered them.

The entrance, at least. A dark mouth in the cliff face at the end of a trail that zigzagged up from the valley floor, marked by two stone pillars that had been carved to look like hands pressed together in meditation. The left hand's smallest finger had broken off sometime in the last three centuries. The right hand was intact. I remembered that too — the right hand had always been intact, as if the sculptor had been right-handed and put more care into the mirror of his dominant hand.

Small things. I remembered small things with a precision that frightened me more than the large things. Because the large things — the valley that was now a plateau, the path that had shifted — those could be argued away. Memory distorts. Time edits. The mind fills gaps with convenience rather than truth.

But the sculptor's right-handedness. The specific finger that had broken. The exact angle of the trail's switchbacks, eleven of them, each one cutting back at slightly less than forty-five degrees.

That kind of memory isn't normal. I knew that. I'd known it for a long time. I just hadn't had a reason to care until the things I remembered started disagreeing with the things that existed.

Xu Ran stood at the base of the cliff and looked up.

"How far?" he asked.

"The entrance is about sixty meters up. The trail is manageable."

"Manageable." He studied the trail. The switchbacks were narrow — barely a person's width, carved into the cliff face by someone who'd valued efficiency over comfort. There were no railings. The drop was sheer.

"You could wait here," I said.

"I could." He shouldered his pack. "I won't."

We climbed.

Xu Ran climbed the way a man crosses a frozen lake — each step deliberate, weight distributed, eyes fixed forward with the aggressive focus of someone who is absolutely not looking down. His knuckles were white around the pack straps. His breathing was controlled, which was a tell — natural breathing isn't controlled, and the effort of controlling it meant there was something to control.

He never said a word. Never admitted what those white knuckles cost him. I respected that. Honesty is overrated; the willingness to do something despite the truth that your body is screaming — that has weight.

The entrance was cooler inside. The temperature dropped five degrees within the first ten steps, and the chalk taste arrived immediately — sharper here, almost metallic, as if the stone itself was oxidizing. The fittings on the walls — brackets for torches, hooks for equipment, iron rings set into the rock at regular intervals — were cold. That dead, drinking cold.

And the incense. Stronger here. Not faint — actual. As if someone had lit a stick somewhere deep inside and the smoke was drifting toward us through tunnels we couldn't see.

"Someone's here?" Xu Ran whispered.

"No."

"But the smell — "

"There's no one."

He accepted that with the particular quality of silence that meant he was filing it under *things she says that I don't understand yet.*

The complex was extensive. I'd been here once, centuries ago, when a cultivation sect had used these caves for meditation retreats. They'd carved chambers into the rock — round rooms of various sizes, connected by narrow passages, designed to isolate practitioners from each other and from the world. Good acoustics for qi meditation. Good darkness for introspection.

The sect was long gone. The caves remained.

I moved through them methodically. Room by room. My hands on the walls, palms flat, fingers spread, reading the stone the way a blind person reads a face. The qi here was layered, like the library — centuries of cultivators pressing their energy into the rock, each layer distinct, each one telling its own story of practice and patience and the slow accumulation of power through discipline.

But underneath.

Underneath all of it.

That foundation again. The impossibly old qi, pressed into the bedrock, integrated with the mineral structure of the stone itself. Not laid on top. Not added later. Woven into the rock as if the rock had grown around it, as if the qi had been there when the stone was still magma, still liquid, still becoming itself.

My qi. My signature.

Not exactly. Similar. The way your handwriting at twenty is similar to your handwriting at forty — the essential shapes are the same, the individuality is preserved, but the hand that made it has changed. Aged. Learned. Forgotten.

I sat in the largest chamber — the one that had been the sect leader's meditation room, based on its size and the quality of its carved ceiling (ornate, ambitious, slightly pretentious) — and pressed both palms flat against the floor.

The foundation qi responded. Not with movement — with recognition. A warmth that started in the stone and crept into my palms and up my arms. Slow. Patient. Not welcoming — recognizing.

I pulled away.

The warmth lingered. My palms tingled. The headache pulsed — a single beat, like a drum struck once and left to resonate.

"Yun." Xu Ran's voice, from the passage. "You should see this."

I found him in one of the smaller chambers. He was standing in front of a wall that had been carved more recently than the others — the stone was cleaner, the edges sharper, the technique different. Someone had been here after the sect had left. Someone had used this room as a study.

The wall was covered in inscriptions.

Different script from the library. More recent — perhaps five hundred years old, based on the character forms. But the content matched. Anomaly reports. Qi flow deviations. Spatial inconsistencies. Terrain that didn't match records. Phenomena that defied established understanding.

Another researcher. Another catalogue of wrongness.

"Same thing as the library," Xu Ran said. He couldn't read the script — it was old, but not as old, and he recognized the structural similarity to the library inscriptions through pattern, not translation. "Isn't it?"

"Similar."

"Similar content? Or similar — "

"Both."

I read. The writing was dense, academic, the voice of someone who approached mystery the way an accountant approaches a ledger — with method, with skepticism, with the dogged insistence that numbers must eventually balance. The researcher had documented seventeen anomalies over a period of four years. Qi surges. Terrain shifts. Phenomenon they called *retroactive adjustment* — things that changed, then appeared to have always been that way.

Seventeen anomalies. Four years.

I had seven in twelve days.

The pace was different. But the pattern held.

And at the end — that abrupt stop. Mid-sentence. Mid-thought. A character half-formed, the chisel still visible in the stone where it had paused and never continued.

Two researchers. Two catalogues. Two identical endings.

I ran my thumb over the final, unfinished character. The stone was smooth where the chisel had rested. No scratches. No damage. Just — stoppage. As if the hand had simply opened and the tool had fallen.

"They stopped," Xu Ran said.

"They forgot."

He was quiet for a long moment. The incense smell drifted through the passage, sourceless, sweet and wrong.

"You know that," he said. "You don't guess it. You know it."

"I know it."

"How?"

Because I could feel it in the stone. Because the qi told me. Because the foundation layer — my foundation layer, or something so close to mine that the difference was academic — carried an imprint of what had happened in these rooms, and what had happened was forgetting. Not dying. Not choosing. Not walking away. Simple, total, unannounced forgetting. The thought that had been forming — the connection that had been building — had been severed. Cleanly. Completely. As if a hand had reached into the researcher's mind and folded the page shut.

I thought of my own list. Seven anomalies. My hands in my pockets, where I kept no folded pages, where I held no dangerous knowledge.

Not yet.

"We keep going," I said. "There will be more sites. More researchers. More endings."

"And you think they all end the same way."

I looked at him. His face was steady, his eyes clear. He wasn't frightened. He should have been. The fact that he wasn't told me something about either his courage or his inability to grasp what we were looking at.

"I think," I said, "that the question isn't how they end. It's why they started. What drew them here. What made them look for the exact thing I'm looking for."

"And?"

I turned back to the wall. The unfinished character stared back at me — the half-formed thought of someone who had been, like me, very close to something true.

"And whether what stopped them will stop me."
