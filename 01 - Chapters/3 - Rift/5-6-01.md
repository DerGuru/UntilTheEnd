# Chapter 33

Meditation had become a performance of futility.

I sat cross-legged on the rock shelf above our camp, eyes closed, breathing regulated, doing everything that the cultivation texts said to do when seeking internal clarity. Breathe. Center. Focus. Turn awareness inward. Find the point where consciousness meets the deeper architecture. Observe.

I observed nothing.

Not nothing as in silence — the peaceful, expansive nothing that advanced practitioners described, the void that contained seeds, the darkness that was actually light waiting. This was actual nothing. An absence. A wall dressed as emptiness, a closed door painted to look like an open field.

I tried anyway. Every morning, for the past three days, I'd sat here and tried. The rational approach: reconstruct what Xu Ran had told me three times. What had been said. What it meant. What truths had been offered and taken. If I thought hard enough, carefully enough, approached from the right angle with the right technique, maybe the wall would thin. Maybe a crack would appear. Maybe some fragment of what had been erased would surface.

Think. Remember — briefly, a flicker, like a word on the tip of the tongue, present for a fraction of a second before it dissolved. Forget. The frustration of losing it. The ground tension, the seismic whisper beneath my feet that said the frustration was translating again. Breathe. Suppress. Try again.

Think. Remember. Forget. Frustrate. Try again.

The cycle was perfect. Closed. Self-reinforcing. Each attempt ended exactly where the last one had, with the same nothing, the same wall, the same gap that pulsed behind my eyes like a second heartbeat.

I didn't know Xu Ran was watching.

He was good at that — at being present without registering, at occupying space without demanding attention. He sat thirty meters below, at the base of the slope, ostensibly reading. His notebook was open. His eyes weren't on it.

He was studying me.

Not the way he studied texts or maps or the tactical details of terrain. He was studying me the way a sculptor studies cracked stone — with the patient attention of someone searching for the fault line, the flaw, the place where pressure had done its hidden work.

I didn't see any of this. I was on the rock shelf, eyes closed, cycling through think-remember-forget-frustrate with the stubborn persistence of someone who has no other strategy and therefore commits fully to the one that doesn't work.

Here is what I know now, from what he told me later and what I've pieced together from his notes:

He watched for two hours. Two hours of me sitting still, breathing, trying, failing. He recorded the cycle — timed it, even. Eighty-seven seconds, on average. Eighty-seven seconds from attempt to failure, a neat package of intention and erasure that repeated with the regularity of tides.

Then he opened his notebook to the pages from the past weeks. His observations. His records. The careful documentation of everything I'd done, everything I'd said, everything that had happened to and around and because of me since we'd entered these mountains.

He was looking for a pattern. Not in the events — he had those mapped, cross-referenced, annotated. He was looking for a pattern in what survived.

The trees I'd split — I didn't remember splitting them, but I knew I'd been angry. The anger remained.

The rain — I didn't remember making rain, but I knew I'd been sad. The sadness remained.

The tremor — I didn't remember the tremor, but I knew I'd been frustrated. The frustration remained.

The field — I remembered the field, mostly, in the way you remember a fever dream, but the mechanics, the raw sensation of locking reality, the understanding of what I'd done — those were fading. Blurring. The edges softening every day, the details dissolving. But the horror of it remained. The feeling of being something I didn't want to be remained.

Content erased. Feeling preserved.

He circled this in his notebook — I found the circle later, precise and dark, pressed hard into the page as if the pen had been driven by realization rather than ink.

The thoughts were deleted. The emotions were not.

Whatever governed the erasure — whatever architecture lay below my awareness, whatever guardian operated beneath my consent — it deleted content but not affect. It erased what I knew but not what I felt. Every experience was being stripped of its meaning while the emotional residue was left intact, like removing the text of a book but leaving the stains where tears had fallen on the pages.

This was not random. This was design.

And if the design preserved emotions while deleting thoughts, then the path to reaching me — to getting truth past the wall, past the erasure, past the guardian that stood between me and understanding — was not through thinking.

It was through feeling.

I know, from his notes, that he sat with this realization for forty minutes. Forty minutes of staring at a circled word in a notebook, understanding what it meant, understanding what he would have to do, and hating every implication.

Because making someone feel something — deeply, viscerally, below the threshold of thought — is not a kindness. Making someone feel the thing that Xu Ran needed me to feel was an act that required cruelty, and cruelty was not in his repertoire, and adding it to his repertoire was a cost he would pay for years.

He closed his notebook.

He didn't tell me. Not yet. He stood, stretched, walked back to camp with the casual gait of someone who had not just decided to do the worst thing he would ever do to someone he cared about. He boiled water. He prepared rice. He performed the routine of evening with the precise movements of a man who needed his hands busy while his mind worked.

I came down from the rock shelf at dusk. Tired. Headache pounding. The exhaustion of failed meditation — not physical, not even mental, but something deeper, something that felt like having pushed against a locked door for hours and having nothing to show for it except sore shoulders and the knowledge that the door was still locked.

"Anything?" he asked.

"No."

He handed me rice. I ate. The food was warm and tasted of nothing in particular and served its purpose, which was to keep my body functional while my mind ran the same failing pattern.

"The cycle doesn't work," I said. Not news. Not even an observation. Just the verbal equivalent of pressing a bruise — confirming the pain was still there, confirming nothing had changed, confirming the cycle.

"No," he agreed. "It doesn't."

Something in his voice. A color I hadn't heard before — underneath the agreement, beneath the careful confirmation. Not deception. Xu Ran didn't do deception, not well, not willingly. But withholding. The sound of someone who knows more than he's saying and has decided that the timing isn't right.

I almost asked. Almost pushed. The question was right there — *what aren't you telling me* — formed and ready and loaded with the accusatory weight of a person who has learned that the people around her keep saying things she forgets.

I didn't ask. I ate my rice. The headache throbbed. The night came down like a curtain, and behind it, somewhere in the space between Xu Ran's silence and my exhaustion, a plan was forming that I didn't know about and wouldn't have approved of and would, when it arrived, shatter something that had needed shattering since before either of us had understood what the word meant.
