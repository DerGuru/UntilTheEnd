# Chapter 16

Xu Ran marked a stone with chalk.

At the time, I didn't think anything of it. We were resting at a narrow pass between two ridges — a natural bottleneck where the trail squeezed between rock walls close enough to touch with outstretched arms. A good place to rest. Shade, a trickle of water from a crack in the south wall, a flat stone for sitting.

He drew a circle on the north wall. Inside it, his initials. Below, the date. His handwriting — loose, confident, the script of someone who writes more than he speaks and trusts the record to outlast the moment.

"What's that for?" I asked.

"Experiment."

"What kind?"

He smiled. It was the smile of someone who has learned something and is waiting — not to be clever, not to prove a point, but to test whether the thing they've learned is real.

"We'll see," he said.

We walked for two hours. South, following the trail as it descended from the pass into a valley thick with old-growth forest. The air changed — cooler, wetter, heavy with the smell of rotting leaves and mushrooms and the deep, organic breath of soil that has been accumulating life for centuries without interruption.

Then Xu Ran stopped.

"Back," he said.

"Back?"

"To the pass. I want to check something."

I didn't argue. Arguments with Xu Ran about his investigations had become a waste of energy — he would check what he wanted to check with the patient determination of water finding its level, and opposing him was like opposing hydrology.

We walked back. The trail was the same — exactly the same, each switchback and stone and root and shadow in the same position. I checked. I checked everything now, reflexively, the way a locksmith checks doors or a doctor checks pulses.

The pass was the same. The shade, the trickle of water, the flat stone.

The chalk mark was not.

It was three meters to the left. On a different stone. A stone that sat at the base of the south wall instead of on the north wall, embedded in the scree like something that had been there for five hundred years. The chalk circle. The initials. The date.

But the handwriting was wrong.

Not wrong in the way that copies are wrong — not blurred, not imprecise, not the product of someone trying to reproduce another person's script. Wrong in the way that translations are wrong. Same meaning, different hand. Same circle, same initials, same date.

My handwriting.

Xu Ran stood in front of the stone and pointed. His finger was steady. His hand was not.

"That," he said, "is your handwriting."

I looked at the chalk marks. He was right. The characters were mine — the angles, the pressure, the particular way I form the stroke of the year character with a slight leftward lean that comes from millennia of writing in a script that no longer exists.

"I didn't write that," I said.

"I know."

"I was with you. Both ways. I didn't stop. I didn't touch the wall."

"I know."

Silence. The water trickled. A bird sang — wrong species again, the same off-range bird from weeks ago, and I noted it and set it aside because there was a larger wrongness demanding attention.

The stone. The chalk. My handwriting.

I crouched. Touched the stone. It was cold in that familiar way — the dead cold, the drinking cold. The surface was rough under my fingertips, weathered, ancient. This stone had been here for centuries. The chalk on it was hours old.

"The original mark," I said. "Your mark. On the north wall."

"Gone."

I checked. The north wall was bare. Unmarked. No circle, no initials, no date. No sign that chalk had ever touched it. The surface was clean — not wiped clean, but naturally clean, as if nothing had ever been there.

"It moved," Xu Ran said. "Your — whatever does this — it moved my mark. Relocated it. Changed the handwriting. Put it on a different stone that's been sitting here for centuries."

"Retroactively."

"Retroactively." He let the word drop. It landed heavy, the way all true things land when you finally say them. "The mark was on the north wall. Now it was never on the north wall. It was always on the south wall. On this stone. In your handwriting."

I stood. My knees protested — the phantom creak again, the body remembering what it's supposed to be.

"That's impossible," he said. Not as an objection — as evidence. He was cataloguing his own disbelief the way he catalogued everything else.

"It's not impossible. It's happening."

"How?"

"I don't know how. I know that it correlates with me. I know that the corrections are retroactive. I know that the qi signature matches mine. And I know —" The headache pulsed. Once. A warning. "— that every correction generates anomalies that radiate outward. The wrong winds. The wrong birds. The reversed qi flows. Every edit creates noise. And the noise is getting louder."

He looked at me. Really looked, the way you look at a map when you realize you've been reading it upside down and everything you thought was north was actually south.

"The sect," he said. "The talismans."

"They're harvesting the noise."

"The noise that YOU generate."

"Without wanting to. Without being able to stop."

He turned back to the chalk mark. My handwriting on his stone. Evidence of something that shouldn't exist, recorded in letters I never wrote on a surface I never touched.

"You're feeding them," he said.

"Yes."

We stood in the pass and looked at the evidence and neither of us said the thing that needed to be said, which was that the evidence was not just proof of what I did to the world — it was proof of what I couldn't control. The corrections weren't a choice. They weren't a technique. They were as involuntary as breathing, as unstoppable as blood, as fundamental to my existence as weight is to stone.

I was the source. And being the source wasn't something I did.

It was something I was.

The headache receded. As if the realization — that exact realization, in that precise form — was acceptable. As if the truth was allowed, as long as it stopped at the edge of understanding and didn't push into the territory of *why.*

I could know what I was. I couldn't know why.

"We need to move," I said.

"Where?"

"Away from here. Every hour we stay increases the disturbances. Every site I investigate, every question I ask, every time I push — it gets worse."

"So stop investigating."

I looked at him.

"You can't," he said. Not a question.

"No."

"Why not?"

Because stopping was the same as forgetting. Because the seven researchers had stopped — not by choice, but by erasure. Because the distance between "I choose to stop" and "I am made to stop" was the distance between freedom and the thing that waited at the center of every thread I was pulling, and I was not willing to be pulled there yet but I was less willing to let go.

"Because the alternative is worse," I said.

He shouldered his pack. Checked the straps. Adjusted the angle of the notebook under his arm.

"Then we move," he said. And we did.
