# Chapter 31

We saw it the next morning.

The sunrise came from the east — as sunrises do, as this one always had, as every sunrise on this mountain had for however many thousands of years this mountain had existed. Xu Ran was already awake, already moving, already performing the routine of breaking camp that had become ritual. I was sitting with my back against a boulder, pressing my thumbs into my temples, waiting for the headache to decide whether today would be a burning day or a throbbing day.

The light hit the landscape. The valley below us opened up in the way that mountain valleys do when viewed from altitude — the slow revelation of depth and distance and the layered greens of forest meeting the browns of exposed rock meeting the blues of sky.

Except the landscape wasn't right.

The mountain — the one opposite us, the one that should have been there, the one that had been there yesterday when we'd looked east and seen its western flank rising above the tree line like a wall — was missing a piece.

Not destroyed. Not damaged. Not collapsed or crumbled or broken apart by earthquake or erosion or any of the geological forces that mountains are subject to. A section of the western flank — roughly three hundred meters wide, roughly four hundred meters tall — was absent.

Gone. As if it had never been.

The word *missing* is wrong. Missing implies that something was taken — implies removal, implies a before and an after, implies that the landscape used to look one way and now looked another. But the landscape didn't look changed. It looked complete. The edge where the mountain should have continued was smooth. Grass grew to the boundary — not the raw, disturbed grass of a fresh scar, but established grass, the kind that takes months to root and years to thicken, growing right up to the line where stone became air.

Wildflowers. Yellow ones. Growing along the edge in the casual abundance of things that had always been there.

Butterflies. Two of them, moving between the flowers with the lazy purposelessness of insects that exist in settled places, that have no reason to be anywhere other than where they are.

The mountain hadn't been destroyed. The mountain had been forgotten.

I stood up. The headache was irrelevant. The headache was a whisper in a room where someone had just screamed.

"Xu Ran."

He was already looking. He'd seen it before me — his vantage point had been slightly different, slightly higher, the angle that caught the missing section first. He stood with his pack in one hand and his notebook in the other and his face was the face of a man looking at something he had spent his entire life believing was impossible.

Mountains don't disappear. Mountains are the one thing — the absolute, fundamental, irrefutable thing — that doesn't disappear. Rivers shift. Forests burn. Cities crumble. But mountains are the benchmark. Mountains are what permanence means.

"What—" he started.

"That was me."

The words came out even and flat. No trembling. No drama. No the-weight-of-it-all inflection that a different kind of person might have given them. Just a statement. Factual. Categorical. Like saying *It's raining* or *The fire is out* or any of the other simple declarations that describe reality as it is rather than as you wish it were.

That was me.

The field. The field had done this. During those eight minutes — or after, during the collapse, during the shattering of the boundary, during the moment when my locked reality had released and the world had rushed back in — something had happened. The field had taken something with it when it broke. Had consumed something. Had erased a portion of the mountain the way my mind erased memories — completely, seamlessly, without leaving evidence that anything had been there.

The world had forgotten the mountain existed. The grass and flowers and butterflies and insects were not growing over a wound. They were growing on ground that had always been ground, that had never been mountain, that existed in a reality where the mountain's flank had simply never happened.

The parallel was precise enough to hurt.

This was what I did to myself. This was what the forgetting looked like from the outside — not damage, not destruction, but the total, retroactive removal of something that had been real. The memories I lost didn't leave scars. They left smooth grass and yellow flowers and butterflies that had no reason to know that something had been there before them.

Xu Ran wrote. His hand moved across the page with the mechanical persistence of someone who has decided that documentation is the only response that doesn't involve screaming. He sketched the outline — the mountain's shape, the missing section, the smooth boundary where absence began. He annotated the flowers. The grass depth. The butterflies.

Evidence of nothing. Evidence of nothing having always been nothing.

"How far is that?" I asked.

"Three hundred meters across. Maybe more. The depth—" He squinted. "I can't tell the depth from here. But the flank was at least two hundred meters thick at that elevation."

Hundreds of thousands of tons of rock. Of stone and mineral and the compressed history of geological time. Gone. Not scattered across the valley — there was no debris. Not disintegrated — there was no dust. Not transported — there was no indication that the material existed anywhere else.

Just gone.

As if it had never been.

"I need to—" I started, and then stopped, because I didn't know what I needed. There was no precedent for this. No map for standing on a mountainside and looking at the absence you created and trying to figure out what to do with the knowledge that you can unmake geography.

"The field," Xu Ran said. "When it collapsed. The energy had to go somewhere."

"It went here."

"It went nowhere. That's the point." He closed his notebook. Opened it again. Closed it. The indecision was jarring — Xu Ran didn't fidget, didn't hesitate, didn't perform the small motor anxieties of uncertainty. "It didn't break the mountain. It removed it. The way—"

He stopped.

"Say it."

"The way you forget things." He looked at me. "Wholesale. Complete. With no trace that there was anything to forget."

The morning was beautiful. That was the cruelest part. The sky was clear, the light was golden, the air was cool and clean and smelled of pine resin and the mineral sharpness of high altitude. Birds sang. Wind moved through the pines with the gentle constancy of wind that has no opinion about the landscape it moves through. Everything was exactly as it should be.

Except for the hole in the mountain where the mountain should have been.

I sat down. Not because my legs were weak — they weren't. Because standing seemed presumptuous. Standing implied a right to be vertical, a right to occupy the landscape eye-to-eye, and I had just removed part of that landscape without meaning to, without knowing how, without being able to reverse it.

A stone shifted beneath my foot as I sat. A small thing — a loose stone on a slope, the kind of minor geological event that happens a thousand times a day on any mountain. My foot slipped. I caught myself. No harm. No consequence.

But the stone shouldn't have shifted. It had been stable. I'd checked the ground before I sat — an automatic habit, the baseline assessment that anyone who lives in mountains performs without thinking. The ground had been solid.

The stone had simply decided to move.

Later — minutes, hours, the timeline of that morning was compressed by the weight of what we were looking at — Xu Ran noticed the water.

"Your flask," he said.

I looked down. The water flask at my belt was wet on the outside — a thin film of moisture seeping through the seam where the leather was stitched. Not much. A few drops. But the flask was new, well-made, the kind of quality equipment that doesn't leak unless it's been damaged.

It hadn't been damaged.

It was just leaking. For no reason.

A loose stone that shouldn't have shifted. A flask that shouldn't have leaked.

I thought about the field. About the cost. About the principle that had been operating since the beginning of whatever I was becoming — that nothing was free, that everything had a price, that the balance kept its accounts with the precision of a scale that valued equilibrium above all.

I'd spent something enormous. The field. The mountain. Hundreds of thousands of tons of reality, erased, consumed, burned as fuel for something I hadn't asked for.

The bill was arriving.

Not in dramatic payments. Not in the grand currency of mountains and weather and locked reality. In small ones. A loose stone. A leaking flask. The trivial, accumulating math of things going slightly wrong.

I didn't name it. I didn't have a name for it. I still don't. But I felt it — the shift in probability, the subtle rebalancing of fortune, the universe's polite insistence that what had been given would be taken back, in installments, with interest.

"We should go," I said.

Xu Ran looked at the mountain one more time. The missing flank. The flowers. The butterflies that moved between them with the serene indifference of creatures that existed in a world where mountains had always looked like this.

"Yes," he said.

We went.
