# Chapter 8

The library was buried in the side of a mountain like a secret someone had tried to tell and then thought better of.

The entrance was high — a narrow gap between rock faces at the top of a scree slope that shifted under our feet like something alive. Xu Ran climbed it with the particular rigidity of a man who was absolutely fine, completely at ease, not at all bothered by the loose stone sliding away beneath his boots or the drop opening behind him with every step.

His hand found the rock wall. Gripped. Didn't let go until we were inside.

I didn't comment.

The air hit us like a wall of age. Thick. Dry. Tasting of chalk so fine it was more like flour — the residue of centuries of stone slowly grinding itself into powder, of plaster crumbling, of walls exhaling their own substance into the dark. My teeth grit against it immediately. The metal fixtures on the collapsed shelving — iron brackets, hinges, the remains of a locking clasp — radiated cold. And underneath the dust, threading through the stale air like a living thing: incense. Musty. Sweet. No source.

Three for three.

The interior was more intact than I'd expected. The ceiling had given way in the main hall — stone and timber splayed across the floor in a pattern that spoke of one catastrophic moment rather than gradual decay — but the side rooms still held. Shelves, mostly collapsed, their contents scattered. Stone tablets, cracked but legible. And scrolls.

Hundreds of scrolls.

Most were ruined — moisture had seeped through rock fissures at some point, turning paper to pulp, turning ink to ghosts. But some had been stored in sealed containers, stone cylinders with wax caps, and those had survived. A dozen. Maybe twenty. Enough.

Xu Ran sneezed. Three times in quick succession, each one louder than the last, the kind of sneeze chain that builds momentum and leaves the victim blinking and slightly offended.

I was already working.

Systematic. Row by row. Shelf by collapsed shelf. Each scroll removed, examined, set aside or discarded. The motion was mechanical — lift, unroll, check, decide. My fingers moved through the work with the efficiency of someone who has searched ruins before, who knows that patience is cheaper than haste and that the thing you're looking for is never in the first place you look.

Xu Ran recovered, wiped his nose with his sleeve, and joined me. He took the left side of the room. I took the right. We worked in silence punctuated only by the sound of stone on stone, paper unfurling, and occasional muttered cursing when a scroll crumbled at the touch.

The light came through cracks in the ceiling — narrow beams that cut through the dust-thick air like blades, illuminating whatever they touched with the ruthless clarity of noon and leaving everything else in shadow. I held scrolls up to those beams one by one, reading through the grit and age.

Most were records. Sect business — rosters, inventories, technique manuals. The administrative skeleton of an organization that had once been alive with purpose and had died of whatever kills organizations: time, infighting, irrelevance.

I found what I was looking for in the third hour.
