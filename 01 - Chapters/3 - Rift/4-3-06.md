# Chapter 23

Something woke me.

Not from sleep — I did not sleep. From the state that occupied the interval between wakefulness and something else — not sleep, but not the full engagement of consciousness either. The state where the body was still, the eyes open, the seeing unfocused — the closest approximation of rest available.

Something had changed.

Xu Ran: asleep. Ten paces away. His breathing even, deep, efficient. The fire: embers. The clearing: dark. The stars in their late-hour positions, confirmed by the temperature dropping and the moisture thickening and the quality of the darkness that said: three hours before dawn.

Everything external: unchanged.

Internal: different.

The impulse was there. The same pre-verbal, pre-thought event from the bramble wall — the one that existed before language, before decision. The one that said: *should*.

I had been listening to the river. Not looking — the river was beyond our clearing, forty paces east, audible as water-over-stone, the sound that rivers made when the bed was shallow and the current was persistent. The river smelled of mud and mineral and the coldness that moving water released at night.

The river was in the wrong place.

Not wrong the way the branches or shadows had been wrong. Wrong in the way only millennia of traversing geography could detect — rivers in this terrain followed north-south valleys. This one flowed east-west. Geographically inconsistent.

The impulse said: move it.

The impulse was physical. In the fingertips. The tingling-pressure that preceded qi deployment — warmth in the hands, charge building in the channels, power waiting for direction. But the direction was not martial. Not defensive. The direction was: shift. Reshape. Edit.

The impulse said: move the river to where the river should be and the should-be is the reality and the reality is the thing I can make.

I caught myself.

Like waking inside a dream. Like the jolt that interrupted falling. I caught the impulse mid-formation, in the space between the want and the action — the only space where catching was possible.

What was the action? If I had not caught the impulse — if the qi had moved, if the direction had been followed — would the river have moved? Would I wake tomorrow to a river that had always flowed north-south, with riverbanks showing decades of erosion in the new direction, with stones polished by centuries of current that had existed for one night?

The question was not theoretical. The paths had happened. The cairn had happened. Reality had been edited and the editing was tied to my frustration and the frustration was a close neighbor of the impulse and the impulse —

Had felt right.

Not the impossibility — I had abandoned impossibility as a category long ago. Not the power — I had power in quantities that exceeded any framework for measuring it. The worst part was: the impulse to reshape reality had felt correct. Natural. The way breathing felt natural. An extension of something already operating.

It felt like remembering how.

Not learning. Remembering. Learning was acquisition. Remembering was recovery — capability that had been present and had been sealed behind a barrier now cracking. The cracks were letting through not just feelings but capabilities.

I had enough of those already. The last thing the world needed was more of what I could do.

I clenched my fists. The qi receded. The tingling stopped. The impulse dissolved. Like a sound fading.

The river continued flowing east-west. Wrong. Real.

I did not sleep for the rest of the night. This not-sleeping was different — vigilant. Watching myself. Monitoring the internal terrain for the return of the impulse that had felt right —. Their rightness was the most frightening thing I had encountered in centuries.

The river murmured its wrong direction. The frogs upstream had stopped when I noticed the wrongness. They hadn't started again.

Morning came. Xu Ran woke. He opened the notebook.

I watched him write the date, the weather, the first observations.

"Something happened," he said, without looking up. The perception of someone who had learned to read shifts in the subject's baseline without requiring the subject's cooperation. "You're different this morning."

"Nothing happened."

"Mm." He wrote that down.

"Your handwriting is getting smaller," I said.

He looked up. The compression-face — surprised, recalibrating. "That's — observational."

"I've been staring at your notebook for weeks. It was inevitable."

Both of us knew which category my earlier denial belonged to: the same category as "Then you weren't looking." Lies that were transparent because the liar did not have enough investment to make them opaque.

We walked. I walked ahead. He followed. The ten paces. The arrangement.

Inside me, the space where the impulse had been: empty. Watchful. Waiting for the next time the fingertips would tingle and the *should-be* would arrive and the arriving would feel like remembering.

The river remained wrong behind us. The river remained real.

So did I.
