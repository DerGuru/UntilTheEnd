# Chapter 3

I practiced the technique again the next morning. Xu Ran was still asleep — or pretending to be, which amounted to the same thing — and the air held that grey, pre-dawn stillness that makes the world feel like a held breath.

I stood in the clearing behind the shrine and raised my arms.

The channels opened before I'd finished the stance. Not gradually — all at once, like floodgates that had been straining against pressure for a very long time. The qi didn't flow so much as pour, and it moved with a certainty that had nothing to do with me. My body knew. My hands knew. My feet shifted to positions I'd never held, and each one felt less like learning and more like coming home to a house I'd never lived in.

The technique was complex. Seventeen distinct forms, each building on the last, each one opening meridians I hadn't known existed. By the fifth form, my breathing had synchronized with patterns I couldn't have described if asked. By the ninth, the qi in my surroundings had begun to respond — the grass bending inward, the air thickening, the morning dew lifting off the leaves in a fine mist that hung at waist height like a ghost's hem.

I stopped at the twelfth form.

Not because I couldn't continue. Because continuing felt like falling — that forward lurch when your foot finds air instead of ground, and your body knows you're going somewhere you can't come back from.

I dropped my arms. The mist settled. The grass straightened. The morning continued as though nothing had happened.

My pulse was steady. My breathing was even. The only sign that anything unusual had occurred was a faint tremor in my right hand — not from exertion, but from the specific kind of wrongness that comes from doing something impossibly well on the first attempt.

"Twelve," Xu Ran said.

I turned. He was sitting in the doorframe of the shrine, legs crossed, notebook open. His hair was flattened on one side from sleep. The pen in his hand was already moving.

"You stopped at twelve. The panel shows seventeen."

"I'm aware."

"You could do all seventeen."

"Probably."

"Why stop?"

Because the thirteenth form felt like a door. Because I could sense what was behind it — not clearly, not specifically, but with the gut-level certainty of someone who smells smoke and knows there's fire. Because some doors are better left closed until you know what you're doing.

"Warming up," I said.

He didn't believe me. He wrote something in his notebook anyway. The scratch of his pen on paper was the loudest sound in the morning.

We left the shrine that afternoon. There was nothing more to find — I'd catalogued every panel, mapped the qi anomalies, taken measurements in the only way I knew how: by feeling, by standing in different spots and letting the currents tell me what geography couldn't. The shrine was one marker. One of several I needed.

The road south was narrow and laced with roots that made walking an exercise in attention. Xu Ran walked behind me, which he did when the path was too narrow for side-by-side and he was thinking about something he wasn't ready to say. I could hear his thoughts in the rhythm of his steps — quick when he was forming an argument, slow when he was discarding one.

"The technique," he said eventually. "It's not in any manual I've seen."

"It's Pre-Consolidated. Most techniques from that era were lost."

"Lost or destroyed?"

"Both usually mean the same thing."

"Not always." He caught up to me where the path widened. "Some things are lost because nobody cared to preserve them. Some are lost because someone specifically wanted them gone."

I said nothing. He was right, and the distinction mattered, and I didn't want to think about which category this technique fell into.

"You've never seen it before," he said. It wasn't a question.

"No."

"But you can do it."

"Apparently."

"Apparently." He let the word sit between us for a few steps. "You did twelve forms of a technique you've never seen, on your first attempt, at dawn, in a ruin you found three days ago." A pause. "And your explanation is 'apparently.'"

"It's the most accurate word I have."

He let it go. Xu Ran was learning — slowly, grudgingly — when to push and when to stop. The pushing came naturally to him; the stopping was a skill he was acquiring the way you acquire calluses, through repeated friction.

We walked for the rest of the day. The landscape changed — less forest, more scrubland, the kind of terrain that happens when mountains get tired of being mountains and start flattening into something more manageable. The qi here was thin, spread across the earth like butter scraped over too much bread. Normal. Boring. I almost enjoyed it.

Almost, because the path was wrong.

I'd walked this route before. Years ago — decades, perhaps, the timeline blurred — but the geography hadn't. This path should have curved east after the third ridge. It didn't. It went straight, cutting through land that I remembered as dense forest. The forest was gone. Or it had never been there. Or my memory was wrong.

My memory was not wrong.

I stopped. Looked back. The ridge behind us sat where it should, the shape familiar, the treeline unchanged. But the path — the path was different. A gentle deviation. If I hadn't known what it used to look like, I would never have noticed. If I were anyone else, walking this for the first time, it would feel completely natural.

That was the thing about wrongness, I was learning. It didn't announce itself. It didn't crash through the door. It was already inside when you got there, sitting in a chair, wearing the room's face, telling you everything was fine.

Xu Ran walked past me. Stopped. Looked back.

"What?"

"Nothing." I started walking again.

Two hundred paces further, Xu Ran stopped by a pine that grew at an angle against the path's edge. He crouched. Ran his thumb along the bark where it compressed against the trail's stone border.

"This tree is sixty years old at least," he said. "But the roots grew around the path. As if the path was here before the tree."

He looked at me.

I kept walking.

Three anomalies. The qi at the shrine. The morning wind. The path. Three in five days. Too many for coincidence. Too few for certainty.

I needed more.

The next ruin was two days south. A library, according to the old maps — or what was left of one. I'd been there once, centuries ago, when it still had a roof and a custodian who brewed terrible tea and told worse stories. The custodian was long dead. The roof, probably, too.

The chalk grit lingered at the back of my tongue, and for a moment it wasn't chalk — it was tea. The custodian's tea had been genuinely terrible. I remembered that clearly — the bitter, over-steeped taste of leaves that had been picked too late in the season and dried too fast. Some things you remember because they matter. Some things you remember because they're the only anchor you have in a sea of forgetting.

I wondered if the library was where I remembered it.

I wondered if I'd find it changed too, shifted by inches or miles, reality quietly rearranging itself when nobody was looking.

I wondered who was doing the rearranging.

That thought — that specific thought — produced a headache. Sharp. Sudden. A spike behind my left eye that came and went in the space of a breath, leaving behind an afterimage of pain like a flashbulb in the dark.

I rubbed my temple. Kept walking.

Xu Ran's pen scratched in his notebook.
