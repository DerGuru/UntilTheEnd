# Chapter 43

The poison was called Yinshi — Shadow-Eater. The name was accurate because the substance was accurate. Not a metaphor. Not a cultivator's dramatic branding. The name described the mechanism: it consumed the qi-channels from within, eating the meridian structure the way shadow eats light — by replacing it with nothing.

I had found it through observation. Not questions. Not investigation in the traditional sense. I had walked through three cities, two abandoned sect libraries, and a ruined apothecary. I had read scrolls that crumbled at my touch, their age exceeding their structural capacity. The information existed in the gaps between official records, the absences that indicated: this subject was suppressed.

Yinshi killed Immortal-level cultivators. Reliably. Completely. In approximately ninety seconds.

The poison's work was documented in a scroll I had found beneath a collapsed shelf in the ruins of the Qinzhou Apothecary — a sect that had been destroyed four hundred years ago for possessing, among other things, this knowledge. The scroll described the mechanism in precise, clinical language: the compound entered the bloodstream, identified the qi-meridian structure, and dissolved it. From the periphery inward. The peripheral channels first, then the secondary, then the primary. The dantian last.

For an Immortal-level cultivator, the dissolution of the meridian structure was fatal. Not because the body couldn't survive without qi — mortal bodies survived without qi permanently. Because at Immortal level, what held the body together had been rebuilt around the qi-channels. The channels were load-bearing. Remove them, and the body: collapsed.

Ninety seconds. Complete dissolution. Unrecoverable.

I knew all of this. I had researched it. The knowledge the controlled experiment required. Not the cliff — the cliff had been impulse, accident, discovery through falling. This was different. This was method.

Xu Ran had the poison.

That fact was itself significant. He had carried it — in his pack, in a small ceramic phial wrapped in oil-cloth, positioned against his hip where the body heat would keep the compound liquid. He had carried it since before he found me. He had acquired it through contacts that I did not ask about and he did not explain. He had calculated the possibility — the scenario in which an Immortal-level cultivator required termination, and the standard methods would be insufficient.

He had carried it for me. Or against me. The distinction was unclear, and the unclarity was: honest.

I found the phial on the third morning after I tore the page from his notebook. He was at the stream, washing. His pack was open — deliberately, I understood later. He had left it open. He had positioned the phial at the top, visible, accessible. He had made the discovery: easy.

The arrangement of someone who had understood my intention before I articulated it and who had chosen to provide the means rather than prevent the action.

I took the phial. I held it. Ceramic, warm from his body heat. Small — the volume of two swallowed mouthfuls. The oil-cloth wrapping was stained with years of proximity to skin and sweat and the faint chemical residue that the compound produced through its container.

I examined it. Turned it. Removed the wax seal. Smelled it.

Nothing. Yinshi was odorless. The absence of smell was itself a design feature — the compound had been engineered for assassination. The craft of people who understood that killing had quality standards.

I replaced the seal.

"How long have you carried this?"

He looked at the phial in my hand.

"Since before I found you."

"For me."

"For whatever was necessary."

The distinction he maintained. Not *for-you*, not *against-you*. For-whatever-was-necessary. The pragmatism of a man who had searched for three months with a poison in his pack and a notebook against his chest.

I put the phial on the flat stone between us. The transition zone. The cooking-and-negotiation space.

"Tomorrow," I said.

He looked at the phial. He looked at me. He nodded.

He did not argue. He did not warn. He did not protect. He reached for his notebook — the first one, the personal one — and wrote something that I could not read from this distance and that I did not try to read.

I spent the rest of the day preparing. I selected a location — a clearing south of our camp, open ground, no structures within the range I had estimated from the cliff data. The cliff-jump had produced the substrate response at approximately the moment of lethal threat. The poison would produce the lethal threat chemically rather than kinetically. The response — if it came — would be observable.

The clearing was sufficient. Flat. Open. The nearest trees at thirty paces. Xu Ran would stand at ten.

Ten paces. The distance he always maintained. The observational distance. Close enough for detail, far enough for — I calculated — safety.

The calculation was wrong.

But I did not know that yet.

The folded page was against my skin. The question — *Why* — pressed into me by belt and cloth and the specific physical persistence of paper against flesh. The question waited. Tomorrow would begin the answer.

Not the whole answer. But the beginning of the mechanism that would produce the answer.

I did not sleep that night. Not from forgetting — from anticipation. The wakefulness that meant the patched-together will was holding. The will was anticipating. The will was planning. The will was alive.

Tomorrow.
