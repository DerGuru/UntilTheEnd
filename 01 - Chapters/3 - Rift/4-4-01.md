# Chapter 26

The cliff existed because the mountain ended.

Not gradually — not the diminishing slope that mountain faces typically performed. This mountain ended. A fault line had sheared the face clean. Erosion hadn't argued. The result was a wall that dropped from the top to the bottom without intermediary stages.

Eight hundred meters. I estimated this from the size of the rocks below, the scale of sparse vegetation at the bottom. Eight hundred meters of air between where I stood and where the ground resumed.

Below: rock. Flat, grey. The kind that shattered what it caught. No water. No scrub. No surface that might convert vertical motion into something less terminal. Rock. The honest kind. The kind that made no promises about what would happen upon contact.

I stood at the edge.

This was not planned. Not in the sense that plans were formulated — the deliberative process, the weighing of options, the assessment of outcomes. The edge was where the path led and the path was the thing I walked and the walking brought me here and here was the edge and the edge was eight hundred meters of vertical nothing above flat grey rock.

My toes — the front third of my feet — extended past the edge. Balance was automatic. The body knew edges. I had stood at edges before. A thousand years of edges — fortress walls, canyon rims, temple rooftops at the periphery of dynasties I could no longer name. The body remembered all of them. The toes held.

Wind. There had been wind — the mountain-edge updraft, the consistent horizontal pressure of operating at this altitude. The wind had been present during the approach, during the last hundred meters where the terrain announced what it was about to do by becoming thinner and more exposed.

The wind stopped.

Not gradually. A cessation. The air that had been moving was no longer moving and the stillness was absolute.

Silence.

Not the forest silence — not the one I carried. This was different. The world pausing. Everything at once: wind, insects, birds, the hum of air itself. Gone.

My own breathing was the only sound. In that silence, my breathing was loud. Too loud. Foreign. My breath sounded like someone else's breath heard from close proximity — the respiration of an organism standing at the edge of eight hundred meters of nothing.

I looked down.

The looking was not vertiginous. Not fear-producing. I looked down the way one looked down from any elevation — with spatial awareness. The distance was eight hundred meters and the awareness was: that is a long way to fall.

Xu Ran was not here. Behind me — at the camp, or on the path, or wherever his trajectory had taken him. He would not see me standing here with my toes past the edge and the silence around me and the rock below.

Or he would. Later. The timeline was not my concern.

I looked down at the rock. Eight hundred meters. Grey. Patient. Stone waited because waiting was all it could do, and stone was good at it.

I didn't know then that patience was the wrong word for what the rock was doing. I would learn. Soon.

The silence held. My breathing continued. The world was a held breath and I was standing on the edge of the breath and the edge was the place where the breath could be released.

I stood.
