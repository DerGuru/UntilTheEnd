# Chapter 1

Forest. Silence.

Not the silence of absence — the silence of exclusion. The forest had sound: wind in canopy, water over stone somewhere to the west, insects in the undergrowth, the low hum of things that lived by living. The forest had all of this. It had it over there, and there, and beyond there. Not here.

Here was the circle.

Three meters. Precisely three. Brown for three meters in every direction — dead grass, dried leaves, the coloration of things that had been alive yesterday. Mine.

I sat on the exposed root of an oak. Old tree. Centuries old, not years — the kind that had outlived its context. Its bark: thick, ridged, the armor of something that had survived by not moving. My back against the trunk. My hands on my knees. My eyes open.

The brown circle extended from my position in every direction. Dead grass. Brittle. Not drought — proximity. To me, to whatever I carried, to the condition that I was.

At the edge of the circle: an ant trail. A line of organized insects moving from somewhere to somewhere else, direct, purposeful. Until it reached my radius.

It bent. The ants — each one, individually, without conference or discussion — turned. Not gradually. Abruptly. As if encountering a wall. They continued parallel to the edge, rebuilding their path around the obstruction.

The obstruction was me.

I had been sitting here. How long — the duration was not available. Time required markers: sunrise, sunset, meals, sleep, the sequential events that converted the continuous experience of existing into the discrete experience of living. I had none of these. The sun had moved. That was information. It was not time.

I did not eat. A berry hung on a branch within arm's reach — red, ripe, close enough to touch. My hand did not move toward it. Not refusal. Eating simply did not occur. The berry was there. I was here. The two facts did not interact.

I did not sleep. The eyes stayed open because closing them was an action and actions required impulse. The impulse was absent. Whatever connected "night" to "close eyes" had disconnected. Not broken — disconnected. Clean.

The smell of leaf rot rose from the circle. Sweet, thick, the scent of things decomposing faster than they should.

Overhead: a bird. Moving through the canopy, east to west. It did not land. It adjusted — mid-flight, a banking of wings, the instinctive kind. Not here. Not near this.

Even the air. Thinner. Something about this space displaced habitability — not visibly, not dramatically, but in the register that living things sensed and fled.

I sat.

Hands on knees. Back against oak. Eyes open. The circle of brown extending from my position like a fact.

A shift in the light. The angle of sun through canopy — late afternoon, or early evening. Hours had passed. I had not counted them.

I sat.

Something — a sound. Distant. The crack of a branch under weight. An animal, probably. Large enough to break wood. Moving through the forest at a distance that was outside my radius and therefore inside the world.

The sound arrived. The sound departed.

I sat.

The oak held me. The bark pressed against my back. The circle of brown. The ants at the edge. The bird that didn't land. The berry I hadn't touched.

Somewhere close, another branch cracked.
