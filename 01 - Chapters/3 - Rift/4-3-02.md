# Chapter 19

The path wasn't there.

We had been walking east — or the direction that Xu Ran's map suggested was east, the map being the cartographic reference he carried and consulted and that I did not consult because consulting required the kind of directed engagement that the disconnection impaired. East, through forest that thickened as the terrain changed from foothills to the lowland density that old growth produced near rivers.

The thickening terminated. Not gradually — abruptly. A wall of vegetation where competing growth reached equilibrium and the equilibrium produced a boundary: impenetrable. Bramble. Thorn-bush. The layered defense of a forest that had decided this direction was unavailable.

"Dead end," Xu Ran said, studying the wall. "We need to go around."

Around was north or south. North was uphill. South was — I didn't know what south was. South was the direction I would have to look to assess and looking required the kind of evaluative attention that was available but expensive and the expense was not justified by the outcome because north and south were equivalent in the absence of preference.

The frustration was not about direction.

The frustration — and it was frustration, a categorical emotion that operated on the axis the disconnection had not severed — was about obstruction. About the reality of a wall between me and forward. About the fact that forward was the only direction the departure-vector recognized, and the wanting was present. Not the full wanting, not the deliberate kind. The involuntary wanting. The need-based wanting that lived below the severed line.

I wanted forward. Forward was blocked. The block was frustrating.

Here should be a path.

Not a thought. An impulse. The thing that preceded thoughts and lived in the space between perception and language, in the pre-verbal stratum where the brain processed reality before the mind commented on it. An impulse that was also a statement: here should be a path.

The bramble opened.

Not visibly. Not in the manner of branches retracting or thorns withdrawing or the dramatic rearrangement that mythological barriers performed when heroes spoke the correct words. The bramble did not move. The bramble had not moved. The path was there.

The path had always been there.

A gap in the vegetation — narrow, leaf-littered, wide enough for one person at a time. Old. Established. The edges worn by use that had accumulated over years, the ground compressed by the weight of feet. The path was old and used and present and real in every measurable way.

Except it hadn't been there thirty seconds ago.

I stood. At the entrance to the path. The path that existed. The path that existed the way the tree exists that you turn to look at — it was there when you looked, and the question of whether it had been there before you looked was the question that could not be answered because looking was the only method of verification.

The path looked old. The path looked permanent. The path looked like a feature of the landscape that had been here since the bramble grew and that the bramble had grown around because paths were older than bramble and the path had precedence.

The path had not been here thirty seconds ago.

I walked onto it. The ground was firm. The leaf litter: years' worth. The accumulation of organic material that forests produced on surfaces exposed to canopy-drop for extended periods. Years. On a path that existed for thirty seconds.

Retroactive.

The word surfaced from the part of me that still analyzed — cold, separate, behind glass — from the category of things I understood because I had encountered them in different forms across different centuries. Retroactive: applied after the fact. Back-dated. The path had not been created — the path had been inserted into the timeline at a point that predated the present, and the insertion had been comprehensive enough that the evidence was genuine. The leaf litter was real. The wear was real. Everything was real in the way that reality was real when reality had been edited.

I would spend years wondering about that word. Edited. Not broken. Not wrong. Edited. As if someone had a draft.

I did not stop walking. I did not examine the path. I did not perform any analysis. I walked through the gap in the bramble on the path that had always existed and that had existed for thirty seconds and that was both things simultaneously.

Behind me, at ten paces, Xu Ran followed. His footsteps on the leaf litter: the sound of boots on compressed organic material. He walked where I walked. He followed the path that hadn't been there.

He was quiet. Not the quiet of someone who hadn't noticed — the quiet of someone processing. The processing was visible in the absence of his usual commentary, in the closed notebook, in the silence that Xu Ran produced when the data exceeded his framework and the framework needed expansion.

The path continued for forty paces. Through the bramble wall. Into the forest beyond — open, navigable, the terrain that the bramble had blocked and that was now accessible.

We emerged. The forest ahead was normal. The path behind was — 

Was.

I did not look back. Looking back would be checking whether the impossible thing was still there. I was not ready for that particular confirmation.

Almost. Almost severed. Almost disconnected. Almost — but not completely. The frustration had produced the path and the path was evidence that the cable was not completely cut, and in that gap, impossible things happened.

The forest opened ahead. I walked into it. Behind me: Xu Ran. Behind Xu Ran: the path.

The path that had always been there.
