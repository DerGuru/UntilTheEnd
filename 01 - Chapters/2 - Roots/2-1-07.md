# Chapter 7

The fire was small. Wei had learned that in the village — one of the things I'd taught him without teaching him, the way proximity teaches, the way watching someone exist carefully for six months teaches you to exist carefully too. Small fires. No extra light. Draw no attention.

He'd tried to cook rice. The result was edible in the way that survival food is edible — it existed, it contained calories, and if you ate it with enough determination you could ignore the texture. I ate my portion without comment. He ate his with the particular focus of someone who is refusing to acknowledge that the food is bad because acknowledging it would mean admitting that his cooking hadn't improved in six months of practice.

The mountains were cold. Colder than the village, which had been sheltered in its valley — here the altitude stole warmth with an efficiency that felt personal. Wei had pulled his collar up. Not enough. His breath made clouds. His fingers, when they weren't occupied with chopsticks or fire-poking, shook with something that was partly cold and partly the other thing — the tremor that I'd first noticed that morning and had been tracking since.

The other thing. The overpressure. The qi that moved through his channels like water through pipes that were too new and too wide and hadn't yet developed the friction coefficients that come with use and age and the gradual accumulation of scar tissue that normal cultivation deposits in normal timescales.

I watched the fire and thought about places I'd left.

Not intentionally. The thoughts came the way they sometimes did — unbidden, unprovoked, surfacing from the sediment of a memory that had four thousand years of depth and occasionally released bubbles of the past into the present without warning or permission.

A village. Not this one — an older one, older by centuries, in a valley that no longer existed in any geography I could reconstruct. I'd stayed there for — how long? Months? A year? Long enough that the people had given me a name. Not my name — a name they invented, the way all my names were invented, provisional titles assigned by communities that needed to call me something and "the woman on the hill" eventually felt insufficient.

I'd left that village too. In the morning. Without explanation. Without farewell. I'd packed — less than Wei had packed, even then — and walked out through whatever gate they'd had and gone north or south or in whatever direction was away, and the village had continued behind me the way villages continue, and the name they'd given me had persisted for a generation, maybe two, before dissolving into the ordinary forgetfulness of human succession.

The first step had been easy. Always easy. One foot, then the other. The earth carried me.

After that it got harder. Not the walking — the walking was just mechanics, and mechanics didn't change. The weight. The accumulation of specific sensory details that attached themselves to the act of departure and refused to dissolve: the smell of cooking fires. The sound of a door closing. Morning light through windows that were no longer mine.

She'd lived there. The woman with — no. Not her. Not now. The memory was too specific, too sharp, and I'd learned centuries ago that the sharp ones were the ones you needed to handle carefully, the way you handle blades — gripping by the handle, never the edge, always aware of which direction the cut would go.

I'd stopped sleeping under roofs after a while. Not a decision — an adaptation. No roof, no attachment. No attachment, no departure. No departure, no weight.

It had worked. More or less. In the particular way that avoidance always works: completely, until it doesn't.

"Yun?"

I looked up. Wei was watching me across the fire. His face was lit from below — shadows upward, the hollows of his eyes dark, his jaw sharp.

"You were somewhere else."

"No."

"You were. Your eyes went—" He made a gesture. Distant. Gone.

"Eat your rice."

He ate his rice. Badly. With the stubborn focus of a boy who knew he was being deflected and was choosing to allow it because the alternative — pressing the woman who'd just left everything behind for him — felt like a debt he wasn't willing to incur.

The fire crackled. The mountain night pressed down. The stars appeared, one by one, in a sky that was clearer than the village's sky had ever been — the altitude stripping away the particulate haze that lowland air accumulated, revealing a depth of starfield that made the universe feel larger and more indifferent than usual.

I'd seen these stars from other mountains. Other camps. Other fires that were small because I'd taught other people — no. Not other people. I hadn't taught anyone. Not for centuries. Not since—

"Yun."

"What."

"Are you going to tell me where we're going?"

"No."

"Okay."

He lay down. Pulled his thin jacket tighter. Closed his eyes. Within minutes, his breathing had shifted to the third-step pattern — automatic now, the body's default mode — and he was asleep.

I sat by the fire. Watched the embers. Watched the boy.

Didn't sleep. Hadn't planned to.

The mountain was dark and cold and empty and exactly the kind of place where I functioned best — without comfort, without company, without the specific warmth of human proximity that I'd spent millennia learning to avoid and that was currently sleeping three meters away and breathing in counts of four, two, six.
