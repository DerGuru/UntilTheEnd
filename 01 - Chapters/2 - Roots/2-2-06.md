# Chapter 15

I took Wei and stepped.

There was no other word for it. Not teleportation — that implied vanishing from one point and appearing at another, the theatrical magic of empty space and sudden presence. This was simpler and more absolute: I took the distance between us and the scouts and compressed it into a single motion and on the other side of that motion was somewhere else.

One step.

The world blurred. Not visually — Wei's eyes couldn't process the transition fast enough to register blur. For him, reality hiccupped. The forest was there, the clearing behind them, three kneeling scouts — and then the forest was different, the air was colder, the altitude was higher, and thirty li of mountain terrain existed between him and the place he'd been standing a heartbeat ago.

Wei buckled.

His hands went to his knees. His stomach revolted — the body's honest response to acceleration that exceeded every parameter that human physiology considered acceptable. His face went pale. Then green. The color transition was rapid enough to be almost interesting.

He breathed. Hard. Fast. His qi-channels were screaming — the sudden displacement had disrupted his circulation pattern and the energy was sloshing through his system like water in a shaken bottle, seeking equilibrium and finding none.

"How—"

"Don't ask."

"How did—"

"Don't. Ask."

His mouth opened. Closed. He breathed again. Slower. The third-step pattern reasserting itself through sheer muscle memory, the body defaulting to the rhythm I'd built into his nervous system when the mind was too overwhelmed to choose an alternative.

"...okay."

The word. Again. But smaller this time. Quieter. Delivered from a crouch on a mountain ridge with his face the color of old paper and his hands gripping his own knees to stop them from shaking.

We were on a ridge. A different range — the geography had shifted, the rock formation older, the trees shorter and hardier, the particular landscape that develops when altitude and latitude conspire to make beauty an act of stubbornness. The valley below was unfamiliar. The scout signatures were gone — not suppressed, not hidden. Gone. Thirty li was beyond their sensing range.

Behind us: nothing. The clearing existed somewhere in the distance, and in it three men were kneeling before empty air, their jade tablet held aloft to an audience that had ceased to exist between one breath and the next.

I felt — nothing. The step had cost nothing. It was the cultivation equivalent of a deep breath — an action so far below my capacity that it didn't register as exertion, didn't create fatigue, didn't even produce the brief satisfaction that comes from deploying a skill well. It was as natural as blinking. As memorable as exhaling.

That was the problem. Not the doing — the ease. The reminder, embedded in every casual miracle, that the gap between me and the world I moved through was not a gap but an ocean, and the ocean was so deep that even standing at its edge made everything on the other side look small.

Wei sat on the ridge. Looked at the valley. His hands were steady now — the tremor suppressed by the qi-regulation that his body was learning to perform automatically, the channel management that his system was developing in response to repeated stress.

He was adapting. To everything. To altitude and cold and displacement that should have rupturing his channels. To the casual impossibility of traveling thirty li in one step with a woman who treated the laws of physics as suggestions.

"You could do that anytime."

"Yes."

"You could have done that when the scouts appeared."

"Yes."

"You waited."

I looked at him. He was doing the thing — the analytical construction, the piece-by-piece assembly of a picture from data points — and he was getting better at it, and the picture he was assembling was uncomfortable.

"I wanted to see the tablet."

He considered that. "What did you see?"

"Organization."

He nodded. Slowly. The nod that meant he understood the word and the weight behind it and the difference between three random scouts and three scouts with a jade tablet and an institutional mandate.

"That's worse than strong enemies."

"Yes."

"Okay."

He stood. His knees held. He looked north — the direction that had become our default, the direction that meant away, farther, more — and started walking.

I followed.

Thirty li behind us, three scouts stood in an empty clearing and reported, via sealed qi-message, that the target had vanished. The message reached a sect hall in a city Wei had never heard of. A functionary read it. Added it to a file. The file grew.
