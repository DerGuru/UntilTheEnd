# Chapter 21

The mountain was necessary.

Steep terrain shed pursuers the way angled rooflines shed rain — passively, through geometry. A searcher with Spirit Gathering cultivation could track on flat ground indefinitely, but vertical gain cost energy, and energy cost time, and time was the distance between us and the three qi-signatures that had appeared at our previous campsite yesterday morning.

So: mountains. The path — a charitable word for the scratch of exposed stone and twisted root that game animals had carved into the cliff face — rose at an angle that made progress a negotiation between gravity and stubbornness. Mist wrapped everything above the treeline in gauze.

Wei climbed below me. His hands found holds with increasing competence — roots, ledges, cracks in the stone. Six months ago he wouldn't have attempted this grade. Three months ago he'd have managed it slowly, painfully, with the inefficiency of a body operating at capacity. Now he climbed with a fluid economy that belonged on someone with years of conditioning, not months.

His qi was doing most of the work. I could see it — routing to his arms when he pulled, to his legs when he pushed, adjusting the load distribution across muscle groups with an efficiency that was sophisticated for any cultivator and absurd for a thirteen-year-old. The channels that had been raw and new after the flood were smoothing out. Not gradually — rapidly. Three degrees of refinement in the past week alone, the equivalent of months of careful development compressed into days.

Too fast.

The thought came reflexively. Not for the first time and not with any confidence that noting it would produce a useful response.

He stopped on a ledge. Breathing hard. Sweat on his face despite the cold. His hands on his knees in the posture that boys adopt when they've pushed themselves past reasonable limits and are waiting for their bodies to forgive them.

The air around his hands shimmered.

I saw it from four meters above. The visual distortion of qi venting through his skin — the overflow of channels running at capacity and leaking excess through the nearest exit. Like heat above summer stone. Barely visible, barely there, the kind of thing that a passing observer would blame on altitude and mist and the tricks that thin air plays on vision.

He flexed his fingers. The shimmer intensified. He relaxed — it faded.

Then the fatigue hit him. Sudden, total — his knees buckling, his body dropping from vertical to seated in the graceless collapse of a system that had been running on credit and had exhausted the account. One moment climbing. The next sitting on stone with his mouth open and his chest heaving.

"Why am I so tired? I was just breathing."

I climbed down to his ledge. Sat on the rock beside him.

"Stop practicing while you climb."

"I wasn't—" He stopped. His face changed — the particular expression of someone who has performed an action unconsciously and is only now realizing it. His qi-circulation had been running a full cycle the entire climb. Double-tasking. Something he couldn't manage three weeks ago. Something he apparently couldn't stop doing now.

The involuntary nature of it was the problem. Not the skill — the automaticity. His body was training itself without his permission, the channels pulling qi through their circuitry the way a river pulls water through a gorge: because the path exists. Because the gradient demands flow. Because the infrastructure, once built, doesn't wait for authorization.

"I wasn't doing it on purpose."

I looked at him. At his hands — rubbing together, hiding the tremor in the friction. At his face — tired, confused, the particular confusion of a boy whose body is doing things his mind hasn't sanctioned and the gap between them is widening.

"I know."

I knew. I knew because I'd seen the phenomenon before — not often, not in this exact configuration, but the pattern was recognizable. A body enhanced beyond its training. Channels that operated autonomously. Qi that moved because it could, not because the cultivator directed it. The signs of a system that had been accelerated past the control mechanisms designed to regulate it.

The signs. But not the cause.

I turned. Kept climbing. Below me, Wei followed, rubbing warmth into hands that weren't cold.
