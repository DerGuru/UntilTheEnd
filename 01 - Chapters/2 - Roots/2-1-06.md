# Chapter 6

The tree was Wei's fault.

First day out. Afternoon. We'd been walking since dawn through forested hills that climbed steadily northward, the path narrowing from road to trail to something that might once have been a deer track and was now barely distinguishable from the undergrowth. Wei hadn't complained. His legs were shorter than mine and his conditioning was the conditioning of a village boy, not a traveler, but he kept pace with the particular stubbornness that I'd learned to recognize as his most reliable characteristic.

We stopped at a clearing. A stream ran through it — cold, clear, the kind of mountain water that tasted like stone and iron. Wei drank, washed his face, sat on a rock.

"I want to try something."

I didn't respond. I was refilling the water container, my back to him, my attention split between the task and the ambient qi-signatures in a two-li radius that were, at this point, entirely wildlife.

"I'm going to try the circulation."

The exercise. The basic one — qi routed through the primary channels, a closed loop, the cultivation equivalent of stretching before a run. He'd done it hundreds of times. In the village, on the hill, in the hut, in every posture and position and state of mind that I'd prescribed.

But that was before. Before his channels had been torn open and rebuilt and widened and strengthened by a flood of qi that had been intended for a tribulation and had ended up in a thirteen-year-old boy who had been in the wrong place at the exactly right time.

I should have said no. Or wait. Or "let me watch your channels first and assess the structural integrity of the rebuilding before you route energy through a system that was fundamentally redesigned four days ago."

I said nothing. Because — and this is the part that's difficult to explain without sounding negligent — I wanted to see. Wanted to know what those channels could do now. The professional curiosity of four millennia of observing cultivators in every stage of development had produced a question, and the question was louder than the caution.

Wei closed his eyes. Breathed. Four counts in. Two held. Six out.

The qi moved.

It moved wrong.

Not broken-wrong, not dangerous-wrong — fast-wrong. The circulation that used to take him thirty seconds to complete one cycle finished in four. The qi hit the end of the primary loop and came back to start before he'd exhaled. Then again. Then again. Each cycle faster, the energy building on itself, the channels conducting with an efficiency that hadn't existed a week ago and that his control mechanisms hadn't been calibrated to handle.

I turned. "Wei—"

The tree.

One arm-thick pine, four meters to his left. The excess qi that his channels couldn't contain had been venting — unconsciously, directionlessly — and the tree had caught. Not fire. Not heat. Something worse: the wood itself failed. Cellular structure disrupted from the inside. The bark split. The heartwood splintered. The entire trunk came apart in a sound like three bones breaking simultaneously.

Wei fell off the rock.

Silence.

Wood fragments settled. Dust motes drifted. A bird, previously unnoticed, departed with an irritated scream.

Wei sat on the ground, staring at the remains of the tree. Then at his hands. Then at the tree. Then at his hands.

"I didn't mean to do that."

I knew. His face told me — the mix of pride and horror that someone produces when they've demonstrated capability that exceeds their expectation and the gap between capability and control has manifested as property damage. Half impressed with himself. Half terrified.

He stood up. Brushed dirt from his pants. Looked at the tree again — really looked, this time — and the pride faded. What replaced it was something quieter, something I recognized from other faces in other centuries: the dawning awareness that power without control isn't power. It's weather.

Then: stillness.

He stood in the clearing, in the afternoon light, with the destroyed pine behind him and the stream running beside him and his hands began to shake. The tremor started at his fingertips and climbed to his wrists and settled in with the particular persistence of a symptom that intended to stay.

He made fists. The shaking stopped. He let go. Back.

He shoved his hands into his pockets. Started walking. Didn't look at me.

I looked at the tree. At the clean rupture lines in the wood. At the way the bark had peeled away — not burned, not rotted. Disaggregated. As if the molecular bonds that held wood together had been informed that their services were no longer required.

A standard qi-circulation exercise. A thirteen-year-old with four months of training. An arm-thick tree, dead.

The math didn't work. His talent was real but not exceptional — solid fundamentals, good discipline, the kind of cultivator who reached respectable heights through effort rather than genius. What I'd just seen wasn't effort. It was output that exceeded input by a margin that didn't have a natural explanation.

I filed the observation. Added it to the growing list of things about Wei that didn't quite add up — the speed of his improvement, the depth of his channels, the way his qi flowed as though it had been flowing for years rather than months.

The list was getting long. The explanations were getting short.
