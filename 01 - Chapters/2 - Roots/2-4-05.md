# Chapter 35

The memory didn't leave.

It settled. The way sediment settles — not vanishing, but sinking to the bottom of whatever container held it, present and permanent, changing the shape of the floor it rested on. I carried it for the rest of the day. Carried it into the evening. Carried it the way I carried everything: silently, internally, with the practiced efficiency of someone who had been the sole custodian of her own grief for longer than most civilizations lasted.

We camped in a hollow between two hills. Sheltered, windless, the kind of location that demanded no effort to occupy and therefore left all effort available for the things that actually required it. Which, tonight, was not moving.

Wei built the fire. He'd gotten good at this — efficient, precise, the technique I'd shown him in the first weeks adapted and refined by repetition into something that was recognizably his. He didn't use qi to start it anymore. Hadn't for weeks. He used his hands and a flint and the friction of physical effort applied to physical material, and I knew — without him saying it — that the choice was deliberate. That the flint was his way of staying human in a process that was making him less human by the day.

Fire caught. Flames climbed. Light spread through the hollow with the democratic indifference of light, illuminating everything equally, revealing nothing preferentially.

I sat across from him. Far enough. Never far enough.

"Yun."

"What."

"What happened earlier? On the trail."

I looked at the fire. The flames moved the way flames always move: upward, reaching, consuming, transforming the material beneath them into light and ash with the indiscriminate efficiency of a process that doesn't distinguish between fuel and artifact.

"Nothing."

"Your eyes looked like— like you were somewhere else. For a while."

"I was thinking."

"About what?"

I looked at him. At his face — lit on one side by the fire, dark on the other, the chiaroscuro of firelight that made every face look older and more honest than daylight permitted. He wasn't pushing. He was asking. The distinction was subtle and absolute and he navigated it with the instinct of someone who had learned, early and completely, that the difference between pushing and asking was the difference between a door opening and a wall going up.

"Old things," I said.

He accepted it. Nodded. Turned back to the fire. Poked it with a stick — an unnecessary gesture, a filler action, the physical equivalent of the conversational silence that meant *I heard you, I'm not satisfied, and I'm choosing to let it go because you need me to.*

The fire crackled. Sparks rose. The night pressed in around us with the patient totality of darkness that has nowhere to be and all the time to get there.

"You know," he said, "when I was little, my father used to — he'd get this look. When he was thinking about before-the-village. Before my mother. I don't know what happened to him before. He never said. But he'd get this look, and it was the same one you had. Exactly."

He paused. Stared at the fire.

"I used to think it meant he was sad. But it wasn't sad. It was — heavy. Like he was carrying something that didn't weigh anything but took up all his strength."

I said nothing. The accuracy of the description didn't require acknowledgment. Some observations are so precise that confirming them would diminish them.

"I never asked him what it was," Wei said. "I figured if he wanted to tell me, he would. And if he didn't, then asking would just make him carry it louder."

He looked at me. Direct. The look of a boy who was offering something — not a question, not a demand, not even empathy, exactly, but something rarer. The offer of being seen without being examined. The gift of a witness who doesn't require testimony.

"I'm not asking," he said.

"I know."

The fire burned. I sat with it. With him. With the memory of a girl under a cherry tree and the reality of a boy by a fire and the through-line that connected them — the stream, my stream, the qi that flowed whether I permitted it or not and that was doing to him what it had done to her and that I could not stop and could not explain and could not address because addressing it required saying the words and the words were:

*I am the reason you are breaking.*

Six words. They lived in the back of my throat — not suppressed, not swallowed, but paused. Held at the gate between thought and speech, waiting for the permission that I would not give because giving it would change what existed between us in ways that could not be unchunged and the thing that existed between us was the only thing I was not willing to risk.

I looked at him. At the boy who fished and failed and tried again and carved to hide his tremors and trusted without demanding and didn't ask.

The Jade Phoenix had not looked like him. Had not talked like him. Had not sat by fires and offered silence like a gift and called small fish a "START" and refused to let me carry his pack and asked "Where next?" as though the destination mattered and the direction was an adventure and the person choosing was worth following.

The Jade Phoenix had been talented and pure and doomed and she had died under a tree whose blossoms were beautiful and whose beauty was the cruelest thing I could remember, and she had died because of me, because my proximity was poison, because my existence was excess, because I — I — I—

"Want rice?"

Wei. Holding a bowl out. Steam rising. The mundane intrusion of a boy who had just offered not-asking as a form of love and was now offering rice as a form of the same thing.

I took the bowl.

"Thank you."

He nodded. Ate his own. The fire burned between us and the night was dark and the stream flowed and the pattern repeated and I ate the rice because eating was the only response I could give that didn't cost me the words I was holding behind my teeth.

The rice was warm. The night was cold. The differential felt like something.

I finished the bowl. Set it down. Looked at the sky.

Stars. The same ones. Indifferent.

Useful.
