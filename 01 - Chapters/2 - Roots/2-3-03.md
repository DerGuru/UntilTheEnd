# Chapter 23

The breakthrough happened at a river.

We'd descended from the mountain range into a valley — warmer, greener. Terrain that existed between ranges like the spaces between sentences, providing the pause that made the next climb bearable. A river ran through it, clean and cold, wide enough to be impressive and shallow enough to be crossable.

Wei meditated at the bank. Standard morning routine — the sequence I'd prescribed weeks ago, integrated into his day automatically, daily, without question.

He sat cross-legged. Eyes closed. Hands on his knees. Spine straight, shoulders relaxed, chin slightly down. Breathing: four, two, six. The qi moved through his channels in the circulation pattern I'd taught him.

Then the click.

I heard it from ten meters away. Not with my ears — with my qi-perception. A sharp, definitive shift. Wei's qi compressed, cohered, tightened into a denser pattern that reorganized his entire channel architecture in a single contraction.

Foundation Establishment — middle phase. The stage that standard cultivators reached after three to six months of intensive work from foundation entry.

Wei had been at Foundation Establishment early phase for nine days.

He opened his eyes. Bright. He grinned.

The full grin. Unreserved, unmodulated. A boy who has just experienced success and wants the world to know.

"I'm getting better."

He leaped up. Qi-steps across the river — faster than before, lighter, the movement's relationship to gravity fundamentally renegotiated. He cleared the width in two bounds, landed on the opposite bank, and laughed.

Laughed. The first real laugh since the village. Full-bodied, unself-conscious.

"Did you see that? Two steps!"

"I saw."

"Two STEPS, Yun. Across a river."

"I was present, yes."

He bounded back. Grinning. Dripping. His landing had been less precise than his takeoff — one foot in the shallows, water sloshing over his ankle.

"Hm."

The universal Yun syllable. Applicable to breakthrough and breakfast and bad weather, carrying whatever meaning the listener needed to hear and none of the meanings I couldn't afford to express.

A nine-day advancement through a three-to-six-month phase was not fast. It was not impressive. It was wrong. It works, until it doesn't, and the failure mode is not gradual.

He bounded back across the river. Grinning. Alive.

Joy wasn't a warning sign. Not always.

But in cultivators, joy sometimes lied.
