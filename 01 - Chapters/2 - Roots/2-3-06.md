# Chapter 26

The explosion happened at two in the morning.

I wasn't sleeping. I hadn't been sleeping — hadn't needed to, hadn't wanted to, had instead been sitting in the dark beside a dead fire and a sleeping boy and running calculations that I ran every night and that produced results I ignored every morning.

Wei had left the camp. I'd let him go — felt his weight shift, heard the careful placement of each foot on the ground, tracked his qi-signature moving northeast through the trees with the deliberate stealth of someone who believes they are being discreet and is correct about everyone in the world except the person they're trying to be discreet around.

He wanted to train alone. Without the "hm." Without the corrections. Without my eyes measuring him and finding the measurements concerning. He wanted the private space of solo practice — the freedom to push and fail and recover without audience.

I understood. The understanding didn't make me comfortable, but comfort had never been a prerequisite for my decisions.

I tracked him through the trees. Not visually — through the ambient qi-field, his signature bright and warm against the forest's cold background. He was two hundred meters northeast. A clearing, probably. Flat ground. He'd chosen well — the terrain equivalent of a practice room, away from anything that could be damaged.

He sat. Breathed. Circulated. The pattern was correct — the pattern was always correct now, his body having memorized the sequence so thoroughly that deviation would have required conscious effort. The qi flowed through his primary channels with the polished efficiency that had been increasing daily, each cycle slightly faster, slightly denser, slightly more than the cycle before.

Then he pushed.

More qi. Faster. Denser. The cultivation equivalent of pressing an accelerator — not gradually, not with the measured increase that I'd prescribed, but fully. The accumulated frustration of weeks of "slow down" and "basics" and "you're bleeding" channeled into a single decision: I want to know what I can do.

The answer arrived explosively.

The qi-pressure in his channels exceeded containment. The excess vented — not through his hands, not through the controlled leak of fingertip qi. Through everything. Through his entire body simultaneously, a spherical discharge that expanded from his center and struck the ground and the air and the trees within a three-meter radius with the force of a localized concussion.

The earth ripped. Not a crack — a rupture. Soil, stone, root systems — torn upward and outward, the ground itself failing under the energy load. A young pine — two arm-widths — uprooted. Stones displaced. A crater, shallow but definitive, centered on the spot where a thirteen-year-old boy had decided to find out what "more" felt like.

Silence.

I was there in three seconds. Not running — moving. The particular quality of movement that covered distance without the intervening mechanics of foot-ground-foot that humans employ. I arrived at the clearing's edge and saw him.

He was standing. Upright, in the center of his own destruction, covered in dirt and leaf matter and the fine dust that violent qi-discharge produces when it disaggregates organic material at the molecular level.

He was grinning.

"Happens to everyone."

It did not happen to everyone. It happened to cultivators who exceeded their control envelope by factors that responsible teachers prevented and irresponsible talent ignored. It happened to prodigies and fools and the particular category of person who occupies the overlap between the two.

His hands were shaking. Badly — not the subtle tremor of overpressure but the visible, rhythmic vibration of a nervous system that had been overloaded and was still processing the excess. He reached for his carving stick — his anchor, his distraction, the tool he'd weaponized against his own instability — and began to whittle. Fast, precise strokes that channeled the excess through fine motor control. The tremor migrated from his hands into the motion of the blade. Hidden. Functional.

Tag 1.

His internal counter. I knew about it because I knew about him — the way I knew about everything within my sphere of attention, whether invited or not. Three days without an outburst. That was his self-imposed rule. His measure of stability. His proof to himself that the power was manageable and the management was improving.

Tag 1 again. Reset.

The carving stick became smaller. He whittled it toward nothing — an animal shape emerging and dissolving as each pass of the blade took more than it should, the over-vigorous cutting of someone bleeding emotional excess through physical motion.

I looked at the crater. At the displaced earth, the uprooted pine, the three-meter circle of evidence that screamed, to anyone with qi-perception within twenty li, that something extraordinary had occurred here.

I looked at the boy. At the grin that was fading into something more complex — pride, yes, but underneath it the particular anxiety of someone who has demonstrated to themselves that the gap between what they can do and what they can control is not closing. Is widening.

---

A memory. Rising. Unbidden.

A young cultivator. Not Wei — older, or younger, or both. Memory doesn't preserve age reliably across millennia, and the boy in my recollection could have been fifteen or could have been twelve and the difference was irrelevant because what mattered was the other details. The ones that persisted.

Brilliant. Obsessive. The particular combination of talent and ambition that produces results at a rate that exceeds every natural parameter and impresses every observer and concerns absolutely no one because brilliance is celebrated and caution is unfashionable.

I'd watched him. Not taught — watched. He wasn't mine. Not my student, not my responsibility, not my concern. A cultivator in a sect that had existed for three centuries and would exist for another two before dissolving into the usual combination of politics and entropy and the failure of institutions to outlast the individuals who gave them meaning.

His core glowed. Literally — visible through his skin the way a lamp is visible through paper. Not the subtle shimmer that Wei produced but the frank, undeniable luminescence of a core that was generating energy faster than the body could regulate. It was beautiful. The way overloaded circuits are beautiful — bright, intense, doomed.

Three days. The glow persisted. His footsteps left qi-traces on the ground. The air around him vibrated. The other students maintained distance — not from instruction but from instinct, the mammalian recognition of something that is generating too much energy to be stable.

On the fourth day, the glow stopped.

On the fifth day, they found his body.

The core had imploded. Collapsed inward, consuming the energy it had been producing, converting output to input in a feedback loop that lasted perhaps a second and left behind a body that looked intact from outside and was empty from within. Skin like porcelain — beautiful. Hollow.

I'd watched. From a distance appropriate to my status, which was no status, which was the woman on the periphery who existed at the edges of things and observed them the way a horizon observes a sunset: present, uninvolved, permanent.

I hadn't intervened. He wasn't mine.

*His core glowed three days. On the fourth, it was cold.*

I looked at Wei. At his hands — still trembling, still carving, still hiding. At his core — vibrating, always vibrating, the hum that I monitored nightly and that hadn't yet reached the point of visible glow but was trending. Trending in a direction that the memory illuminated with the particular cruelty of historical precedent.

He wasn't that boy. Different circumstances. Different training. Different foundation — a foundation I'd built, deliberately, with the patience and precision of four thousand years of knowing what happened when foundations were hasty.

Different. Probably.

I stepped into the clearing. Took the carving stick from his hands. His fingers kept moving for a moment — the ghost-motion of interrupted habit.

"Sleep."

He looked at me. At the crater. At his hands, which were finally beginning to still without the carving to channel them.

"It really does happen to everyone."

"Sleep."

He slept. Or pretended to. I sat beside the crater and watched his core vibrate and counted the frequency and compared it to baselines and told myself that the numbers were fine.

The numbers were not fine. But the alternative to telling myself they were fine was telling him, and telling him would require explaining what I feared, and explaining what I feared would require admitting that I was afraid, and admitting that I was afraid would break something in the architecture of our relationship that I had spent months constructing and that depended, fundamentally, on the fiction that I was not afraid of anything.
