# Chapter 9

Morning.

The path wound through the mountains like a scar — narrow, ancient, carved by feet that had walked it for centuries before abandoning it to gravity and undergrowth. Mist hung at waist height, cold and wet, turning the forest into something half-dissolved, the trees emerging from whiteness like objects remembered rather than seen.

Wei walked ahead. Two steps in front. His pace was steady, his footing sure — the qi in his channels was working with his body now rather than against it, the raw overflow of the first day settling into something that resembled integration. He still stumbled occasionally, when a root caught him wrong or the ground shifted under a loose stone, but the stumbles were smaller. His recovery was faster.

He'd stopped talking. Not sullen — focused. His jaw set, muscles tight, eyes forward. A boy walking into an unknown and putting one foot in front of the other because stopping was not an option.

He didn't look back.

I walked behind him. My steps made no sound — not intentionally, not through any application of qi or technique, but through the accumulated habit of four millennia of movement. My body had forgotten how to announce itself. The forest accepted my passage as something that happened without consequence.

A bird called. Wei's head turned — quick, instinctive. A flicker crossed his face. Not quite a smile. The corner of his mouth lifted, a reflex he didn't control and probably didn't notice.

I saw it. The almost-smile. The boy who was frightened and displaced and walking away from everything he'd known, who could still hear a bird and find in it something worth the muscles required to lift the corner of his mouth.

A stream crossed the path. Wei jumped — qi-enhanced, automatic, his legs pushing off with force that carried him three meters when gravity said one. He landed, caught himself, kept walking.

"You could just step through it," he said without turning.

"Where's the fun in that?"

He glanced back. Half a grin. "You don't have fun."

"I have fun. You just can't tell."

"Nobody can tell."

He kept walking. The grin stayed a moment longer than he'd intended.

I stepped through the stream. The water touched my ankles. I didn't feel it. Not because I was suppressing sensation — because sensation, at my level of existence, was a choose-to-notice system rather than an automatic one. I could feel the water if I decided to. I didn't decide to.

The path climbed. The mist thinned. The trees changed — broadleaf giving way to pine, the forest's acknowledgment of altitude, everything pressing toward efficiency and stripping away anything ornamental.

Wei was ahead. Two steps. Always two.

He didn't know where we were going. I hadn't told him and he hadn't asked again — after "everyone" and "further" and "okay," the subject had been filed. He walked because walking was the available action. He went north because north was the available direction. He followed me by walking ahead of me, a paradox he maintained without noticing — his direction the right one because I was steering with the subtlety of a current, a degree here, a suggestion there.

I watched his back. His thin shoulders, his hands hanging loose at his sides now, the tremor subsided, the fingers still. Temporarily. I knew that. He was beginning to know it too.

The mountain rose ahead. The forest thinned. The sky above was enormous — clear, depthless blue, the color altitude produces when there's nothing between you and the emptiness except diminishing air.

Then I felt it.

Faint. Distant enough that I almost dismissed it — a qi-signature, south-southeast, at the very edge of what a cultivator at Foundation level might detect. Not strong. Not threatening. But organized. Deliberate. Moving in a pattern that wasn't travel. It was search.

I said nothing. Adjusted our bearing three degrees west. Wei didn't notice.

"Yun?"

"Hm."

"How far is north?"

"As far as it needs to be."

He accepted that. Kept walking.

Two people. One path. No destination. And somewhere behind us, the first thread of the net beginning to move.

Wei didn't look back. I didn't either — but for different reasons. He didn't look back because he was choosing forward. I didn't look back because I already knew what was there.

The path continued. We continued with it.
