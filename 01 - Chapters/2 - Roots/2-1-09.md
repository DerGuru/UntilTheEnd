# Chapter 9

Morning.

The path wound through the mountains like a scar — narrow, ancient, carved by feet that had walked it for centuries before abandoning it to gravity and undergrowth. Mist hung at waist height, cold and wet, turning the forest into something half-dissolved, the trees emerging from whiteness like objects remembered rather than seen.

Wei walked ahead. Two steps in front. His pace was steady, his footing sure — the qi in his channels was working with his body now rather than against it, the raw overflow of the first day settling into something that resembled integration. He still stumbled occasionally, when a root caught him wrong or the ground shifted under a loose stone, but the stumbles were smaller. His recovery was faster. The new awareness that let him feel the world's qi was also letting him feel the ground beneath his feet, the air resistance against his body, the micro-adjustments that experienced cultivators made unconsciously and that he was learning to make through the blunt force repetition of walking for three straight days.

He'd stopped talking. Not the sullen silence of anger — the focused silence of someone who was processing. His jaw was set the way it set when he was working through something internal, the muscles tight, the eyes forward, the posture of a boy who had accepted that he was walking into an unknown and was putting one foot in front of the other because stopping was not an option and looking back was not a choice.

He didn't look back.

I walked behind him. My steps made no sound — not intentionally, not through any application of qi or technique, but through the accumulated habit of four millennia of movement. My body had forgotten how to announce itself. Footfalls that should have crunched on gravel were silent. Branches that should have snapped under my weight yielded. The forest accepted my passage the way it accepted wind — as something that happened without consequence.

A bird called. Wei's head turned — quick, instinctive, the response of a boy who still noticed birds. A flicker of something crossed his face. Not quite a smile. The corner of his mouth lifted, a reflex he didn't control and probably didn't notice, the involuntary response to a natural sound after three days of nothing but footsteps and his own breathing.

I saw it. The almost-smile. The turn of his head. The boy who was frightened and displaced and walking away from everything he'd known, who could still hear a bird and find in it something worth the muscles required to lift the corner of his mouth.

I said nothing. Watched him walk. Watched his back — thin, straight, the spine of a boy who had decided that posture was a form of dignity and was maintaining it through altitude and cold and uncertainty.

A stream crossed the path. Wei jumped — qi-enhanced, automatic, the kind of reflexive power application that happened without thought or decision, his legs pushing off with force that carried him three meters when gravity said one was plenty. He landed, caught himself, kept walking. Didn't look back. Didn't comment.

I stepped through the stream. The water touched my ankles. I didn't feel it. Not because I was suppressing sensation — because sensation, at my level of existence, was a choose-to-notice system rather than an automatic one. I could feel the water if I decided to. I didn't decide to.

The path climbed. The mist thinned. The trees changed — broadleaf giving way to pine, the forest's acknowledgment of altitude, the biological response to conditions that pressed everything toward efficiency and stripped away anything ornamental.

Wei was ahead. Two steps. Always two.

He didn't know where we were going. I hadn't told him and he hadn't asked again — after that first night, after "everywhere" and "further" and "okay," the subject had been filed in whatever internal system he used for storing things that were true and unsolvable and therefore didn't benefit from repeated examination. He walked because walking was the available action. He went north because north was the available direction. He followed me by walking ahead of me, the particular paradox of a boy who was leading because the woman behind him had made him believe that his direction was the right one when in fact she was steering with the subtlety of a current — a degree here, a suggestion there, never visible, always effective.

I watched him walk. Watched his back. Watched his hands — hanging loose at his sides now, the tremor subsided, the fingers still. Temporarily. The stillness was temporary. I knew that. He was beginning to know it too.

The mountain rose ahead of us. The forest thinned. The sky above was enormous — clear, depthless blue, the particular color that altitude produces when there's nothing between you and the stratosphere except diminishing air.

Two people. One path. No destination.

Wei didn't look back. I didn't either — but for different reasons. He didn't look back because he was choosing forward. I didn't look back because I'd learned, across centuries and departures and villages that grew smaller in memory until they were nothing, that there was never anything behind me that wasn't already gone.

The path continued. We continued with it.
