# Chapter 17

The western route gave us a week.

Seven days of walking through country that resembled what villages called "pleasant" — rolling hills, streams that ran clear, forests where the undergrowth had thinned enough to allow passage without the continuous negotiation of branches, roots, and the particular category of vines that seemed to grow specifically to inconvenience travelers.

Wei improved. The cough receded. His color stabilized. The altitude change — lower, warmer, wetter — suited a body that was still thirteen and still operated, despite the qi-enhancement, under the fundamental constraints of biology.

His training continued in the margins. Morning breathing at camp. Qi-circulation while walking. The exercises I'd prescribed: channel maintenance, flow regulation, the basic housekeeping of a cultivation system that required daily attention the way a garden required daily watering. He was diligent. The stubbornness that had driven him through six months of village training was proving equally effective on the road — possibly more so, because the road provided no distractions, no routine, no comfortable inertia. There was only the walking and the training and the woman who walked behind him and corrected his form when it drifted, which was often, and said nothing when it was good, which was always.

He was getting used to that. The silence as approval. The particular Yun-dialect in which criticism was verbal and praise was its absence.

On the fifth day, he caught a fish.

This requires context. Wei had been attempting to fish since the second day of the journey. The results had been — educational. He'd lost two hooks, broken a line, fallen into a stream (once), and on one memorable occasion had succeeded in hooking a rock with sufficient force that the resultant tension had launched the rock from the water and struck him in the chest, leaving a bruise and a grudge that he carried for three days.

On the fifth day, the mechanics aligned. A mountain stream, knee-deep, cold enough to numb his fingers in minutes. He stood. He waited. He cast — a primitive rig, handmade from cord and a bent nail, the kind of fishing equipment that belonged in a comedy rather than a survival scenario.

The fish took. A modest thing — three hand-widths, silver-sided, the kind of mountain fish that existed because mountain streams were too cold for anything larger and too remote for anyone to bother depleting the stock.

He held it up. Grinning. The full grin — unreserved, unembarrassed, the expression of a boy who had achieved something measurable and wanted it witnessed.

"Dinner."

I looked at the fish. At the boy. At the grin that hadn't been calibrated for audience and was therefore entirely honest.

"It's small."

"It's MINE."

He cooked it that evening. Over the fire, on a stick, with herbs from his bundle — the technique improving incrementally, the way everything about Wei improved: through repetition, stubbornness, and the refusal to acknowledge that failure was anything other than a preliminary report.

The fish was good. I ate my portion. Didn't say so.

He noticed. The absence of criticism. The Yun-dialect speaking in its native tongue.

He grinned again. Smaller. Private. The grin of someone who has been heard in a language that most people can't speak and appreciates the translation.

I watched the fire and pretended I hadn't noticed the grin.

But I had.
