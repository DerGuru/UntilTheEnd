# Chapter 34

The memory came three days later.

I'd been holding it at arm's length — the recognition, the pattern, the fact that this had happened before and that I knew what it meant and that knowing changed nothing the way it had changed nothing the last time and the time before that and every time before that stretching back across centuries in a chain of identical mistakes linked by identical outcomes.

We walked. The hills were gentle — low, forested, the kind of terrain that didn't demand attention and therefore left the mind free to do what free minds do, which was go to the places you'd told them not to go.

Wei talked. About the road, about the hills, about the fish he was going to catch when we found the next river ("a real one this time, not a practice fish"). About the merchant in the last village who'd tried to sell him a jade pendant that was obviously glass. About the stone he'd found that looked like a cat. About anything. Everything. The continuous monologue of a boy who understood silence better than most adults and chose noise anyway because noise was his way of being present and presence was his gift to the person walking beside him who couldn't reciprocate.

I heard him. The way I always heard him — peripherally, attentively, the dual-channel processing that allowed me to monitor his words for content while tracking his body for indicators and his qi for fluctuation and the ambient field for threats and my own internal state for the collapse that I could feel approaching the way you feel a storm approaching: not by seeing it, but by the pressure change.

"—and the cat-stone has these little lines that look like whiskers, see—"

I didn't see. I was four thousand years away. Standing in a different garden, in a different season, watching a different person bloom too fast for their roots to hold.

*The cherry tree.*

The memory didn't ask permission. It arrived the way memories arrive when they've been held down too long — not gently, not in pieces, not with the courtesy of a guest entering a house. It kicked the door in.

A garden. Southwest. The sect whose name I had stopped saying because saying it made it specific and specific things could be looked up and verified and I preferred the anonymity of loss. The garden had cherry trees — old ones, planted by a generation that had believed in aesthetics as a form of spiritual practice and that had been right in ways they hadn't understood.

The girl was seventeen when I found her. Or she found me — the direction of finding was debatable, because I hadn't been looking and she hadn't been seeking and the encounter had been the kind of accident that, in retrospect, had the precise geometry of intention. She was meditating. Under the largest tree. Her eyes closed. Her qi — pure. Unallocated. The energetic equivalent of fresh snowfall: undisturbed, unreferenced, waiting for the first foot to mark it.

I'd stopped. Not to watch — to listen. Her qi had a sound. Not literal sound — the perceptual analog that experienced cultivators develop, the synesthetic translation of energy into something the mind can categorize. Her qi sounded like water. Clean water, moving slowly, through channels that were so perfectly formed that the flow was laminar rather than turbulent.

I'd stayed. One day became three. Three became a week. A week became a pattern. I told myself I was resting. I told myself the sect's location was convenient. I told myself the garden was pleasant and the cherry blossoms were beautiful and the air was clean and none of these things were lies and all of them were incomplete and the incompleteness was the space where the truth lived that I was refusing to occupy.

She grew. The way a tree grows in sunlight — visibly, daily, in ways that anyone watching could measure. Her cultivation advanced. Foundation to Core Formation in four months. Core Formation through its phases in another six. Breakthroughs arrived like springtime: predictable, inevitable, one after another, each building on the last with a momentum that her sectmates called genius and her elders called blessed and I, sitting in the garden with cherry blossoms falling on my shoulders, called familiar.

Because I'd seen it before. Not with her — before her. Others. Rare, scattered, across centuries — the pattern of someone too close to me growing too fast for too long and the growth looking like talent and the talent looking like destiny and the destiny ending the same way every time.

But I hadn't connected it. The pattern was there, but the cause — the mechanism — the physics — I hadn't understood. I'd thought it was coincidence. I'd thought it was them. Their potential, their will, their unique and specific genius that happened to express itself during the window of my proximity.

I hadn't thought it was me.

The sect named her Jade Phoenix. The elders knelt. The young cultivators looked at her the way pilgrims look at icons — with a reverence that is nine parts admiration and one part fear and the fear is the part that's accurate.

Three years.

I gave her three years of my proximity and in those three years she became what a normal cultivator would become in thirty and the sect celebrated and the elders planned and the region talked about the prodigy in the cherry garden and I sat beneath the tree and watched the blossoms fall and didn't understand that I was the cause until it was too late to be the cure.

The fourth year. Spring. The cherry trees bloomed. She stood beneath them — taller now, thinner, her features sharpened by the cultivation that had refined her body the way fire refines metal, burning away the excess until only the essential remained. She reached for the next breakthrough. The last one. The one that would confirm everything the sect believed about her.

Her core was full. Too full. Grown too fast, fed too much, expanded beyond the structural tolerance that her body — her human, seventeen-year-old, three-and-a-half-year cultivator body — could sustain.

She reached. The core opened. The breakthrough began.

And the core broke.

Not violently. Not with the explosive force that Wei's outbursts carried. Quietly. A sigh. An exhale. The sound of something giving way not because it was struck but because it was overfull and the fullness itself was the destruction.

She sank. Slowly. To her knees, then to the ground. Under the cherry tree. The blossoms fell on her — pink on white, the colors of a celebration that had arrived for the wrong occasion.

I stood three steps away. I could have caught her. Could have intervened. Could have flooded her system with stabilizing qi and held the core together with force and bought her time and maybe — maybe — saved what was breaking.

But I didn't know. Not then. Not in that moment. I didn't know that my qi was the poison, didn't know that more of me was the last thing her system needed, didn't know that the cure I was about to apply was the same substance that had caused the disease.

I stepped forward. Reached out. My qi met her shattered core and—

It didn't help. It was like pouring water into a cup that was already made of water. There was nothing to fill. Nothing to hold. The structure was gone and my energy passed through the space where it had been and dissipated and she lay on the ground and the blossoms fell and I knelt beside her and I didn't understand.

She died three days later. Or: the cultivation died, and the girl survived, and the difference between surviving and living is a distinction that the living understand and the surviving don't.

The sect mourned for a year. Then forgot. People forget.

*I thought strength was a gift. I was wrong. Strength that isn't earned is a debt. And the interest is paid by the body that carries it.*

Wei's voice cut through the memory.

"—Yun? Yun. You stopped."

I had stopped. In the middle of the trail. My feet planted. My body still. The past and the present occupying the same space the way they sometimes did when the memory was too heavy to exist in only one time and overflowed into whatever moment was available.

"I'm fine."

"You were — your eyes went weird."

"Fine, Wei."

He watched me. The look that was too observant for thirteen. The look that said *I see you not being fine and I'm choosing not to push and the choosing costs me something and I'm paying it because I trust you.*

I started walking. He followed. The cherry tree stayed. The blossoms fell. And somewhere, beneath the layers of suppression and denial and four thousand years of practice at not feeling, a girl sank to the ground under a tree whose flowers were the color of something I didn't have a word for anymore.

Pink on white. Pink on white.

The stream kept flowing.
