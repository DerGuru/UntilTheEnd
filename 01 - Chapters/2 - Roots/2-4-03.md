# Chapter 33

I didn't sleep that night.

This was not unusual — I rarely slept, and when I did it was a concession to habit rather than biology. But this was the first time in centuries that I didn't sleep because I couldn't. Because the thing in my head was too heavy to put down and too sharp to hold and every time I tried to set it aside it cut me.

*I'm breaking him.*

The sentence repeated. Not as thought — as fact. The way gravity repeats. The way erosion repeats. The way a river cuts through stone by being the same thing, in the same place, doing the same damage, for long enough that the stone stops being stone and becomes a valley.

I sat by the dead fire. Wei slept four meters away. His core glowed — faint, warm, the soft luminescence of a system that was running hot and didn't know it. My qi flowed to him. I could see it now — couldn't unsee it. The stream was constant. Unchanged by my awareness. Unchanged by my horror. Autonomous.

I'd tried to stop it. In the afternoon, after the discovery. I'd pulled my energy inward — the same way I'd compressed it in moments of combat, the same deliberate contraction that could reduce my qi-signature to functionally zero. The technique was four thousand years refined. It had hidden me from sect elders, from divine-sense sweeps, from entities whose perception operated on scales that I preferred not to think about.

It held for twelve seconds.

Twelve seconds during which no qi left my body. Twelve seconds during which Wei's core dimmed, fractionally, the way a fire dims when you block the draft. Twelve seconds of success.

Then: breakthrough. Not his — mine. My qi punched through the compression like water through a paper dam. Not gradually. Not leaking. Punching. An explosion of outward energy that was stronger than the baseline by a factor that I found personally offensive, as though the act of suppressing it had not reduced it but concentrated it, loaded it, turned a steady drip into a pressurized burst.

Wei had flinched in his sleep. His channels absorbed the burst with the reflexive efficiency of a system that had been absorbing my overflow for so long that it had adapted. Evolved. Built itself around the input the way a tree grows around a stake — incorporating the foreign object into its own structure until removal becomes indistinguishable from damage.

*I can't stop it.*

The fact sat in my chest like a stone. Not the metaphorical kind — the physical kind. Heavy, inert, occupying space that other things needed for function. Breathing felt harder. Not because my body required breath, but because the habit of breathing responded to emotional weight the way all habits do: by becoming difficult when difficulty is what the moment demands.

I couldn't stop the flow. I couldn't control it. I couldn't suppress it, contain it, redirect it, or modulate it. My qi — my ancient, impossible, millennia-dense qi — had found a target and was feeding it with the blind persistence of a force of nature, and I, who could flatten mountains and redirect rivers and hold a tribulation in my hands, could not prevent my own energy from streaming into a sleeping boy whose core was eating itself alive on the nutrients I was providing.

The irony was architectural. The most powerful being in this world, and the one thing she couldn't control was herself.

Morning. Wei woke. Sat up. Rubbed his eyes with the back of his hands — a childish gesture that he hadn't outgrown and that I hoped he wouldn't because the list of things he hadn't outgrown was the list of things about him that were still his and not mine and not the cultivation's and not the qi's.

"Morning," he said.

"Morning."

"Did you sleep?"

"Yes."

A lie. Small. The kind that doesn't count because it serves no purpose except the avoidance of a conversation that the liar can't afford to have.

He ate. Cold rice. The portion was adequate — he'd been eating better since the descent from the mountains, since the air had thickened and the altitude had released the compression on his appetite and the food had started staying down instead of coming back up.

I watched him eat and saw the stream. My qi, flowing. His channels, receiving. The exchange that had been happening in plain sight — my sight, specifically — for months, possibly longer, and that I had not seen because I had not looked and had not looked because I had not wanted to and had not wanted to because some part of me, deeper than analysis, deeper than four thousand years of accumulated wisdom, had known what looking would reveal.

"We should move," I said.

"Where?"

Northwest. Away from the river. Away from the valley that was too exposed and the road that was too traveled and the scouts whose search radius I could feel at the edge of my perception, contracting.

"Into the hills."

"More hills?"

"Different hills."

He packed. Efficient — the routine was muscle memory now, the practiced economy of someone who had been living in transit long enough that transit was no longer preparation for living but living itself. He tied his bedroll. Checked his pack. Stood.

"Ready."

I stood. Walked. He followed. The distance between us was three meters — the habitual gap, the geometry of travel that we'd settled into without negotiation. Three meters. Close enough for conversation. Close enough for intervention.

Close enough for the stream. My qi, crossing the gap with the ease of something that found three meters laughably insufficient as a barrier. Three meters was nothing. The stream operated at ranges that made three meters look like standing on each other's feet.

I walked faster. Not to escape — you can't escape yourself. Because motion required focus and focus displaced thinking and thinking was the enemy and the enemy was winning and the only weapon I had against it was the deliberate occupation of attention with logistics, with terrain, with the thousand small decisions that travel demanded and that I welcomed because each decision was a second of not-thinking and each second was a mercy.

Wei matched my pace. Didn't comment on the speed. He'd learned — early, completely — that my pace was information. When I walked slowly, we were safe. When I walked fast, we weren't. Or I wasn't. Or the distinction had ceased to matter.

We entered the hills. The trees closed around us. The river sound faded.

The stream didn't.
