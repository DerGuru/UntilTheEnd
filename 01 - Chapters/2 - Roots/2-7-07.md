# Chapter 68

He didn't know.

Morning came with the efficiency of mornings — light, temperature differential, the operational restart of a world that had spent eight hours in standby mode. Wei woke. Stretched. Made the particular sound of a boy whose body was simultaneously fourteen years of growth and four thousand years of cultivation spillover and whose sound was therefore somewhere between a yawn and a structural assessment.

"Sleep well?" I asked.

"Better than lately. No dreams."

No dreams. No awareness of the light, the hum, the shadowless minutes. No memory of the core's midnight broadcast, the autonomic expression of a power that his conscious mind spent its waking hours suppressing and that his unconscious mind released with the casual indifference of a container that didn't know it had a lid.

"Good," I said.

He ate. Rice from yesterday, cold, augmented with dried herbs and the mountain water that tasted of minerals and altitude. He ate quickly — the eating habits of someone who had learned that meals were fuel rather than events and that the transition from eating to training was a distance that could be shortened through velocity.

"Your hands," I said.

He looked at them. Held them out. The tremor was — present. Both hands. The right: consistent, small-amplitude, the oscillation of muscles receiving contradictory instructions from a nervous system that was being overridden by a qi-system that wasn't technically supposed to interact with the nervous system but that did because Wei's qi didn't follow technical specifications. The left: intermittent, the secondary tremor that appeared under stress and that was now appearing without stress, which meant that the baseline had shifted and the shift was permanent.

"Same as yesterday," he said.

"Worse than yesterday."

He shrugged. The shrug of — I'd been cataloguing his shrugs. They had evolved. The early shrugs were dismissive, the casual gesture of a boy who hadn't yet understood what was being dismissed. The recent shrugs were administrative — the acknowledgment of a fact and its simultaneous filing under "known" and "managed" and "not currently actionable." This shrug was the latter. An administrative shrug. The gesture of someone who had added "worsening tremor" to a list and whose list was organized and whose organization was his defense.

He trained. I watched. The compression exercises were improving — five-breath holds now, consistent. The qi-suppression was clean. His signature virtually disappeared during the holds, the cultivator equivalent of holding one's breath in a room full of predators.

But the rebounds. After each compression, the release produced a qi-flare that was larger than the previous day's. The signal that was being suppressed wasn't diminishing — it was growing. The compression was — I searched for the accurate metaphor — pressing on a spring. The spring was getting stronger. The pressing was getting harder. The moment when pressing became insufficient was not theoretical.

"Again," he said. To himself. His voice: focused. The focus of someone who had identified a problem and was applying the only solution available and whose application was disciplined and thorough and would have been admirable if the solution were viable and whose viability was—

I watched him train for two hours. Then stopped him. Not because he was doing it wrong — because he was doing it right. Too right. Too well. The proficiency was itself the danger, because proficiency enabled more compression and more compression enabled more rebound and more rebound was the thing that would, eventually—

"Enough," I said.

"I can do more."

"That's the problem."

He looked at me. The look of someone who had been told that their competence was a liability and who was trying to process a concept that contradicted every previous instruction and whose contradiction was not confusion but revelation and whose revelation was unwelcome.

"Rest," I said.

He rested. Sat on a rock. Drank water. His hands: trembling. He put them between his knees — the gesture of concealment, the hiding of the visible symptom in the space between body parts, the physical equivalent of the conversational deflection I'd taught him without teaching him.

"Yun."

"What?"

"The boy at the inn. His tremor. Was it like this?"

I considered the answer. Weighed it. Measured the space between truth and utility and found the space smaller than I wanted and larger than I needed.

"Similar."

"How similar?"

"Same mechanism. Different stage."

"What stage am I?"

Silence. The silence of calculation — not of what to say, but of how much. The dosimetry of truth. How many rads of honesty could he absorb without the honesty becoming damage and the damage becoming the thing I was trying to prevent.

"Earlier," I said. "Earlier than he was."

"How much earlier?"

"Enough."

The non-answer. Delivered in the register of competence that disguised the register of evasion. He heard it. I could see the hearing — the micro-expression that indicated recognition of the technique, the brief assessent of whether to challenge and the decision not to, and the decision was not acceptance but tabling, the placement of the question on the growing pile of questions whose pile had become a monument.

He stood. Picked up his pack.

"More walking," he said.

"More walking," I said.

We walked. The mountains accepted us — not warmly, not with invitation, but with the indifference that was itself a form of welcome. The mountains didn't care about stability counts or qi-luminescence. The mountains cared about geology and weather and the slow project of erosion and the slower project of uplift and the slowest project of being present while everything else moved.

I envied the mountains.

Not for the first time. Not for the last.
