# Chapter 2

He spoke before he woke.

It was the fourth morning. Grey light through the window, the air still holding the night's chill. His mother had fallen asleep in her corner — exhaustion winning the argument against vigilance — and I was alone with him. Alone with the sound of his breathing and the slow pulse of his qi and the creaking of the hut's walls in a wind that smelled like aftermath.

His lips moved.

Not the random twitching of dreams — deliberate, shaped, the mechanics of speech operating without the consciousness to authorize them. Sounds first, then syllables, then words.

"...tried before..."

I leaned closer. Not because I needed to — I could hear a sparrow's heartbeat at fifty meters — but because the words had texture. Weight. Something beneath them pressing upward.

"...the stopping never worked..."

My hands went still on my knees.

"...she kept going back. Every time. She said she wouldn't and she did and she did and she—"

He trailed off. A murmur, fading. His face was smooth — no distress, no nightmare. Just a boy talking in his sleep. Saying things a thirteen-year-old boy could not know. Things about me. About the pattern that had defined every century of my existence — the leaving and the returning and the leaving again, the endless recursion of a woman who told herself each departure was the last and knew, with the certainty of someone who has broken the same promise four thousand times, that it never was.

*She kept going back.*

I sat very still. Three seconds. Five. The kind of stillness that isn't calm — the kind that is the exact opposite of calm, the rigid absence of motion that a body produces when the mind behind it has been struck by something it did not expect and cannot immediately process.

He murmured something else. Softer. Lost in the transition between wherever he'd been and the surface of sleep. The words dissolved before they reached coherence.

Then silence. His breathing settled. The third-step pattern resumed — four, two, six — and he was back in the steady rhythm of reconstruction.

I let it go.

Not slowly, not reluctantly, not with the theatrical resistance of someone who wants to be seen struggling. I let it go the way I let everything go — quickly, completely, with the practiced efficiency of a mind that had been burying inconvenient truths since before this province had a name. I took the words and I folded them and I put them in the place where I put things that couldn't be examined and shouldn't be remembered and wouldn't be discussed.

He wouldn't remember. They never did — the half-conscious, the dreaming, the sleepwalking prophets who occasionally whispered truths they'd pulled from somewhere I didn't want to think about. It happened. It meant nothing. It meant nothing because I decided it meant nothing and my decision was final.

The lie tasted exactly like the last one.

He woke up two hours later.

His eyes opened and the world shifted.

Not metaphorically — his eyes were different. The same brown, the same shape, the same stubborn architecture of a face that I'd been watching for months. But behind them, now, something moved. Qi, present and visible, a shimmer like heat above summer stone. Not constant — flickering. Irregular. The signature of channels that were full for the first time and hadn't yet learned what full felt like.

He blinked. Looked at the ceiling. Looked at his hands. Raised them, turned them over, examined his palms as if they belonged to someone else and he was trying to decide whether to keep them.

"What happened to me?"

His voice was rough. Four days of silence had dried it.

"You lived."

"That's not an answer."

"Yes it is."

He sat up. Slowly, with the careful movements of someone testing whether their body was going to cooperate. It cooperated — reluctantly, stiffly, but it cooperated. He swung his legs off the mat, placed his feet on the floor, pushed himself upright.

And stood.

His mother woke up. Saw him standing. Made a sound — not a word, not a cry, something between the two that mothers produce when relief and fear occupy the same space and neither is willing to yield.

Wei looked at her. Looked at me. His jaw was harder than I remembered. Not physically — the bone structure hadn't changed in four days. But something behind his face had tightened. The specific hardening that occurs when a child absorbs an experience that ages them and the aging settles into the architecture of their expression and stays.

"I feel..." He searched for the word. Couldn't find it.

"Different," I said.

"Yes."

He walked to the door. Opened it. The morning light hit him and he stood there, framed in the doorway, a boy who had been carried inside unconscious and was now standing in sunlight that he could probably feel differently than he'd ever felt it before — the qi in the air, the energy in the light, the subtle vibration of a world that had always been there and that he was now equipped to perceive.

Then he stopped. The animation drained from his posture. He went still — perfectly, completely still — and his hands began to shake.

Not weakness. Overpressure. Qi that was pushing through channels that were wide enough to carry it and strong enough to hold it but new enough that the flow hadn't smoothed into routine. Energy looking for an exit. Finding his hands.

He looked down. Made fists. The shaking stopped. He released them — back.

He looked at me.

"Is this normal?"

"It'll get better."

I didn't know if that was true.
