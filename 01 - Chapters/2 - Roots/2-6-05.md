# Chapter 55

Wei approached Xu Ran at noon.

I didn't stop him. I could have — a word, a look, the particular arrangement of my silence that communicated prohibition without requiring the syllables. I could have deployed any of the mechanisms that eighteen months of proximity had established as our shorthand for "don't." I didn't. Because stopping him would have required a reason, and the reason was a truth I couldn't share, and the truth was that the boy across the room was a casualty of the same force that was currently flowing from my body into Wei's channels, and the similarity was not coincidence but architecture.

Wei walked to Xu Ran's table. Sat down. Not across from him — beside him. The particular geometry of someone who was making a social decision and choosing the configuration that communicated: *I'm not here to face you. I'm here to sit with you.*

Xu Ran looked at him. The look was — complicated. The face of an eighteen-year-old who had been a prodigy and was now a ruin and who was being approached by a thirteen-year-old whose qi-pattern he'd just read as a warning he knew the language of.

"You're the boy," Xu Ran said. "From last night. With the—" He paused. Searched for the word. Found it. "—the woman."

"Yun."

"Is that her name?"

Wei shrugged. The shrug of someone who knew the answer and was choosing not to elaborate and whose choice was a form of loyalty that cost him nothing and gave me everything.

Xu Ran studied him. The study was professional — the assessment of a sect-trained cultivator whose training hadn't dissolved with his core and whose analytical frameworks were still operational even though the power that had backed them was gone.

"Your qi is suppressed," he said. Matter-of-fact. The tone of a doctor observing a symptom rather than a stranger commenting on someone's condition. "You're holding it in. But it leaks."

Wei's jaw set. The muscle. The indicator.

"At your age," Xu Ran continued, "with that density — you shouldn't need to suppress. Suppression at Foundation level means excess. And excess at your age means—" He stopped. The sentence ending itself before the conclusion because the conclusion was the thing he'd lived and the living hadn't been educational.

"Means what?"

"Fast growth."

"Is that bad?"

Xu Ran looked at his own hands. The hands that had once produced qi-output sufficient to challenge a tribulation and that now couldn't light a candle. The hands that were the final exhibit in the case of what fast growth cost when fast growth met structural limits.

"I was the fastest in my generation," Xu Ran said. "Foundation in six months. Core Formation in a year. They called me the Morning Star." The name landed with the particular sound that names make when they belong to someone who no longer exists. "I was going to reach Immortal before thirty."

He turned his hands over. Palm up. Empty.

"Now I can feel the weather through my core crack. That's what's left."

Wei was quiet. The quiet of someone processing information that was too relevant to dismiss and too frightening to internalize and that was therefore being held — suspended, in the space between understanding and feeling, waiting for one to catch up to the other.

"What happened?" Wei asked.

"I tried to ascend. Triggered a natural tribulation. My core was — I thought it was ready." A sound that might have been a laugh if it had contained any of the qualities that laughter required. "It wasn't."

"The sky thing. The wave. The village."

Xu Ran's eyes widened. A fraction — the minimal dilation that indicated surprise in someone who had trained himself to suppress surprise. "You were there?"

"I was there."

Five seconds of silence. The kind that weighs.

"I didn't—" Xu Ran began. Stopped. Started again. "The village wasn't — I didn't know people would—"

"They did."

Two words. Not accusatory. Not forgiving. Factual. The verbal economy of a boy who had watched a tribulation tear his world apart and who was now sitting beside the person who had caused it and who was choosing, actively, consciously, to remain seated.

Xu Ran looked at the table. At the grain of the wood. At the nothing that surfaces provide when looking at someone else becomes too expensive.

"Then why are you sitting here?"

Wei considered this. The consideration was visible — the particular quality of his breathing when he was thinking through something whose answer mattered and whose articulation required more care than his thirteen years of linguistic refinement usually provided.

"Because I wanted to see what you look like."

Not cruel. Not kind. Honest. The specific, brutal honesty of someone who had been wondering about the person behind the catastrophe and who had come to see — not to judge, not to forgive, not to avenge, but to see. To put a face on the event that had changed his life.

Xu Ran met his eyes. Held them. Two boys — one broken, one breaking — looking at each other across a gap that was six years wide and a lifetime deep and that neither of them could cross but both of them could see.

"And?" Xu Ran asked.

Wei stood. Pushed the chair in. The gesture of someone who had completed the task they'd come to perform and who was leaving because staying would require more than he had brought.

"You look tired."

He walked back. To our table. To me. To the woman who was watching everything and saying nothing and whose watching was the thing that connected the two of them — the stream that fed one and the event that had broken the other, both originating from the same source, both products of the same four-thousand-year-old existence that couldn't stop affecting things by being near them.

"Satisfied?" I asked.

"No."

"But?"

"But I saw."

He sat. Ate. The noodles were cold. He ate them anyway.

Across the room, Xu Ran stared at the grain of the wood and saw whatever the grain showed him — the pattern, the history, the growth rings of a tree that had been cut down and made into a table and that existed now as the thing you looked at when looking at anything else was too much.

Two boys. One on each side of the same equation. And the equation was me.
