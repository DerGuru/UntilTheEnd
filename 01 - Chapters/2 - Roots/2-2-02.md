# Chapter 11

The cough got worse on the third morning.

Not dangerous — not yet. The thin, persistent hack of a body protesting cold air and altitude and the insufficient insulation of a jacket that had been adequate for village life and was inadequate for mountain travel. Wei didn't complain. He coughed, wiped his mouth, kept walking. The particular resilience of a boy who had grown up hungry and had learned, before he was old enough to articulate the lesson, that discomfort wasn't a condition to be solved but a baseline to be endured.

I noticed. I didn't say anything. The noticing was automatic — the result of six months of monitoring his physical state with the habitual precision that I applied to everything within my sphere of attention, whether I wanted to or not. Heart rate: slightly elevated. Breathing: shallower than optimal, the cough interrupting the third-step pattern every few minutes. Core temperature: adequate but trending downward. His channels were compensating — routing qi to his lungs, warming the tissue — but the compensation was instinctive rather than controlled, and the energy drain was adding to the general strain of a body operating above its natural parameters.

We walked through high country. The trees were sparse here — scrubby pines that clung to the ridges like things that had been told to leave and refused. Wind came from the north, steady, cold, carrying the smell of stone and ice and the vast emptiness of peaks that nobody climbed because climbing them served no purpose.

Wei's training continued. He couldn't stop — the qi in his channels demanded movement, demanded circulation, demanded the continuous cycle of input and output that kept the energy from pooling and producing the tremors that occurred when he stood still. Walking was training. Breathing was training. Existing, for Wei, had become a full-time exercise in managing a system that was too large for its container.

His hands shook when he rested. He'd developed techniques to hide it — picking up sticks, adjusting his pack, clasping his hands behind his back as if stretching. Small deceptions. Effective enough for an audience of one, and the audience was me, and I saw through them the way I saw through everything: completely, immediately, and without the kindness of pretending otherwise.

I let him hide it. The privacy of his struggle was more valuable than the reassurance of my acknowledgment. Some things needed to be carried alone — not because they were light, but because the carrying was the point.

Afternoon. A ledge overlooking a valley. Wei sat on a rock, legs dangling, his face tipped toward a sun that was warm enough at altitude to feel like generosity. His breathing steadied. The cough receded. His hands, resting on his knees, were still.

Almost still.

The tremor was there — visible in the fine muscles of his fingers, the slight irregularity of the skin's surface where the nerves beneath were firing without authorization. He looked at his hands. Held them up. Studied them the way you study a tool that's developed a fault — not with alarm, but with the practical attention of someone who needs the tool to work and is assessing compatibility between the fault and the function.

He picked up a stick. Started peeling bark. Methodical, precise movements — the knife work that I'd taught him for herb preparation, repurposed for distraction. His hands steadied when they had something to do. The work channeled the excess energy through fine motor control, bleeding the overpressure into the deliberate muscle contractions of carving.

He didn't look at me while he carved. I didn't watch him while he carved. We both maintained the fiction because the fiction was kinder than the alternative and kindness, between us, had always been a matter of what we pretended not to notice rather than what we said.

He whittled the stick into nothing. Picked up another.

By evening, there was a pile of wood shavings at his feet and his hands were steady and neither of us mentioned it.
