# Chapter 61

Night. Forest. Fire.

The arrangement was becoming ritual — the selection of site, the gathering of wood, the construction of flame, the positioning of bodies around it. Wei on one side, me on the other, the fire between us performing its ancient function of providing light to people who used the light to see each other and the seeing to measure the distance that the light couldn't cross.

Wei poked the fire with a stick. The stick was green. The fire objected to the moisture content through the medium of smoke, which rose in the particular gray-white spirals of wood that isn't ready in the service of a fire that doesn't care.

"The boy," he said.

"What boy?"

"From the inn. The one with the broken core."

"What about him?"

"Who was he?"

"Nobody."

Wei looked at me. Through the fire. Through the smoke. Through the careful architecture of the answer I'd constructed, which was load-bearing and insufficient and whose insufficiency was visible to a thirteen-year-old boy who had begun to test walls with the methodical persistence of water.

"You looked at him," Wei said.

"I look at many people."

"No, you don't."

True. Observed accurately. Filed correctly. Deployed now, in the dark, by a fire, with the calm precision of someone presenting evidence.

"He was a cultivator," I said. The minimum. The floor of disclosure beneath which conversation becomes refusal and refusal becomes a different conversation — one about the refusal itself, which was worse, which was the territory I was trying to avoid.

"I know he was a cultivator. His channels were visible to anyone above Foundation Establishment." Wei set the stick down. Carefully. The care of someone who had decided that the next words required both hands free and the absence of props. "He was the one who stopped the sky. Wasn't he?"

The question. Specific. Direct. The question I'd been waiting for since the courtyard, since Wei had seen Xu Ran and the pieces had begun to move toward each other with the gravity of puzzle pieces that belonged together and that only required proximity to make their belonging obvious.

"What makes you think that?"

"His qi-signature. It matched the scar pattern in the stone — the one we saw in Part—" He caught himself. Not Part. He didn't think in those categories. "The one on the cliff. Three weeks ago. The blast mark that felt like lightning and regret."

Lightning and regret. Wei's taxonomy. His classification system for qi-signatures, developed independently, expressed in poetry rather than technical nomenclature, more accurate for the imprecision. The blast mark had felt like lightning and regret. Xu Ran's shattered core had felt like lightning and regret. The matching was — obvious, if you had the sensitivity. And Wei had the sensitivity. Wei had always had the sensitivity.

"Yes," I said. Because the lie would have been too large. Because some lies require engineering that the available materials can't support. Because he'd done the work and the work was correct and denying correct work was a category of cruelty I hadn't yet adopted and didn't plan to adopt tonight.

"He tried to ascend and it broke him."

"Yes."

"And he found us."

"He found us."

Wei was quiet. The fire cracked. Sparks rose — orange, brief, aspiring to the height that their fuel couldn't sustain, the tiny vertical ambitions of burning matter reaching for distance before the physics intervened and the reaching ended and the falling began.

"Who was he? Before?"

"Before what?"

"Before the breaking."

"A prodigy. The strongest of his generation. Core Formation in his twenties. On track for a tribulation before thirty-five."

"And now?"

"Now he walks and pays with fragments."

Wei absorbed this. The absorption had a quality to it — a weight. The density of information settling into a mind that was building something with it, a model, a framework, the internal architecture of understanding that Wei constructed continuously, silently, from the materials that circumstance provided and that he assembled with the patience and persistence that the materials deserved.

"He said the tremor gets worse. Then it breaks."

"He said that."

"You didn't correct him."

No. I hadn't. The observation was precise. Surgically precise. The kind of precision that exposed not the fact but the absence beside the fact — the space where correction should have been and wasn't, the negative space of reassurance withheld, and the withholding was itself an answer and the answer was the shape of the silence and the silence was—

"There's nothing to correct," I said.

Wei looked at me. The look was long. Longer than the fire justified. Longer than the conversation required. The look of someone who was assembling pieces and arriving at a picture and the picture was not the one on the box and the discrepancy was not confusion but clarity and the clarity was worse.

"You always say 'nobody,'" he said. "Whenever I ask. 'Nobody.' 'No one.' 'Just a traveler.' 'Just a merchant.' 'Sleep.'" He listed them. My deflections. Catalogued. Indexed. Stored and now retrieved, presented in sequence, the evidence of a pattern that was not a pattern like weather was a pattern but a pattern like policy was a pattern — deliberate, consistent, designed.

"I don't believe you anymore."

Five words. Not loud. The volume of — I've described it before. The volume of truth. Low. Steady. Delivered with the calm of someone who had arrived at a conclusion through process rather than emotion and whose conclusion was therefore not an opinion but a finding and whose finding was not anger but fact.

Feststellung. Not accusation. Statement. The worst kind.

"Wei—"

"I'm not asking you to tell me. I'm telling you I know you're not."

He lay down. Turned toward the fire. Pulled his blanket up. The sequence of motions that constituted going to sleep, performed with the deliberate normalcy of someone who had said the thing and was done with the saying and whose doneness was not resolution but tabling, the placement of an item on an agenda that would be revisited at a time not of my choosing and in a manner not of my design.

I sat. The fire burned. The forest performed its nighttime operations — insects, wind, the distant commentary of things that moved in the dark and whose movement was the dark's way of reminding itself that it was occupied.

I don't believe you anymore.

The words sat in me. Not dissolving. Not settling. Floating. The way things float that are too heavy for the surface and too light for the bottom: suspended, permanent, the specific weight of a sentence that had been coming for five Parts and that had arrived not with the drama of an event but with the inevitability of a season.

The lie from Part 5. The first one. "Too much qi through immature channels." It had been clean. Clinical. Survivable. It had been the lie that made everything else possible — the continued travel, the continued training, the continued illusion that the arrangement was partnership rather than parasitism and that the parasitism was manageable and that the management was care.

And now the foundation shifted. Not cracked — that would imply damage, and damage implied repair. Shifted. The movement of ground that was still ground but was no longer where you'd placed it, and the building was still standing but the standing was now conditional, and the condition was something I couldn't control because the condition was a thirteen-year-old boy who had stopped believing and whose disbelief was not doubt but data.

The fire went out. I didn't relight it. The dark was appropriate. The dark was honest. The dark said nothing and claimed nothing and concealed nothing because there was nothing to conceal when the concealment itself had been named and the naming had made the concealment visible and the visibility had made it useless.

Wei breathed. Sleep or its imitation. The sound of a boy in a forest at night, by a dead fire, beside a being who had lied to him and whose lies he had catalogued and whose catalogue he had presented without anger and without forgiveness and without the possibility of pretending that the presentation hadn't happened.

I sat in the dark.

It was a long night.
