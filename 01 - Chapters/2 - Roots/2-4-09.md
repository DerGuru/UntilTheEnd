# Chapter 39

I left at dawn.

Wei slept. The fire was ash. The air was cold — lowland chill, the temperature that bodies notice and qi-bodies don't.

I walked east. Away from the camp. Away from him.

Not far. Not permanently. This was a test — hypothesis, method, predicted outcome. Distance: if proximity was the conduit, then distance should reduce the flow.

I walked. Counted paces. My qi-sense remained extended behind me — a thread of awareness connecting me to Wei's sleeping form. I could feel his core. His breathing. His qi-field, warm and oversaturated.

One hundred meters. The stream was unchanged. Full density.

Two hundred meters. Unchanged.

Three hundred meters. The camp was behind a rise — out of sight. The stream thinned. Marginally. Present but reduced.

Five hundred meters. Thinner. The inverse-square law of qi-propagation applying itself with mathematical reliability.

Eight hundred meters. Weak. A fraction of baseline — ten percent, maybe less.

One thousand meters.

Almost nothing. The stream was a whisper. At one thousand meters, my contribution to Wei's cultivation was functionally zero.

*Distance works.*

Clean. Clinical. One kilometer of air, maintained continuously, would slow his acceleration. Would give his core time to consolidate.

One kilometer. In a world that was hunting us. Leaving a thirteen-year-old alone at a distance that would take me seconds to cross at full speed and minutes at any speed that wouldn't level the landscape between us.

I turned back.

At six hundred meters, the stream strengthened. At four hundred, half-baseline. At two hundred, full. At one hundred — stronger than full. The compensation effect: the qi denied during my absence was returning augmented. My system making up for lost output with the overproductive enthusiasm of a mechanism that resented the attempt to stop it.

By the time I reached the camp, the stream was flowing at what felt like a hundred and twenty percent. More than before I'd left. The distance hadn't reduced the net flow. It had deferred it. Created a debt that my qi was paying with interest.

Wei was stirring. Semi-conscious.

"You went somewhere."

"Stretching my legs."

He opened one eye. The look. The one that said *I know that's not true and I'm letting it go.*

"Your qi feels different."

I went still. "Different how?"

"Stronger. Like you... opened something. Or stopped holding something."

His perception. Always his perception. Reading my energy state the way most people read facial expressions — automatically, accurately, without understanding the mechanism.

"Go back to sleep."

"Yun."

"What."

"Whatever it was. It didn't work, did it."

The silence lasted three seconds. Three seconds of a thirteen-year-old boy, half-asleep, diagnosing my failure with the precision of someone whose qi-channels were tuned to my output like a radio to a station.

"Go back to sleep, Wei."

He closed his eye. Slept. Or pretended to.

The stream flowed. Stronger than before. *Hungry.*

The word arrived without permission. As though the qi had a quality that exceeded physics and entered something adjacent to will.

Not my will. The qi's own. Autonomous. Independent. Following instructions given by something other than me.

I sat. The morning came.
