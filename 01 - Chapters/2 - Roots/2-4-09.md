# Chapter 39

I left at dawn.

Wei slept. What remained of the night's fire was ash. The air was cold — not mountain-cold, not dangerous, but the lowland chill of early morning before the sun reaches the ground, the temperature that bodies notice and qi-bodies don't.

I walked east. Away from the camp. Away from him.

Not far. Not permanently. This was scientific. A test with a hypothesis and a method and a predicted outcome, and the fact that the hypothesis made me feel like I was swallowing glass did not disqualify it from being a hypothesis.

Distance. If proximity was the mechanism — if my physical nearness was the conduit through which my qi reached his system — then distance should reduce the flow. Enough distance should stop it. And stopping it, even temporarily, would prove the principle and the principle would indicate the solution and the solution would be—

I stopped thinking about the solution. The solution was a door I hadn't opened and behind it was a room I wasn't ready to enter.

I walked. Counted paces. Converted to li. My qi-sense remained extended behind me — a thread of awareness connecting me to Wei's sleeping form the way a lifeline connects a diver to the surface. I could feel him. His core. His breathing. His qi-field, warm and oversaturated and pulsing with the slow rhythm of deep sleep.

One hundred meters.

The stream was unchanged. Full density. Full flow. My qi reaching from my body to his across one hundred meters of cold air and damp grass as though the distance was an opinion rather than a fact.

Two hundred meters.

Unchanged.

Three hundred meters. The camp was behind a rise now — out of sight, though not out of sense. My perception held him the way cupped hands hold water: completely, intimately, with the constant awareness that the holding was temporary and the water was alive.

At three hundred meters, the stream thinned. Marginally. The reduction was measurable — not significant, not meaningful in any practical sense, but present. The way a candle dims when you move it from a room to a hallway. Still burning. Still bright. Just — less.

Four hundred meters. Thinner. The stream was attenuating — the inverse-square law of qi-propagation applying itself with the mathematical reliability of physics doing what physics does, which is be predictable and impersonal and indifferent to the emotional state of the person conducting the experiment.

I kept walking. Five hundred. Six hundred. The grass was wet. My feet left no marks — a habit, not a choice, the automatic trajectory erasure that my body performed the way other bodies performed heartbeats.

Eight hundred meters. The stream was weak. A fraction of the baseline — ten percent, maybe less. Wei's core was visible to my perception as a distant glow, faint, the way a star is visible from a city: technically present, practically obscured, overwhelmed by the noise of everything between the source and the observer.

One thousand meters.

Almost nothing. The stream was a whisper. A trace. The qi-equivalent of a scent carried on wind — detectable if you knew what to look for, negligible if you didn't. At one thousand meters, my contribution to Wei's cultivation was functionally zero.

*Distance works.*

The fact arrived clean. Clinical. The kind of result that a scientist would write in a notebook with a steady hand and a neutral expression and that a person would receive with the particular sick feeling of confirmation that you'd hoped wouldn't confirm.

One thousand meters. That was the answer. A kilometer of air between my body and his, maintained continuously, would reduce the flow to negligible. Would slow his acceleration. Would give his core time to consolidate, his channels time to adapt, his body time to catch up to the cultivation that my proximity had been force-feeding him since the day he'd refused to leave a porch.

One thousand meters. In a world that was hunting us. In terrain that offered no guarantee of safety beyond the range of my immediate intervention. Leaving a thirteen-year-old boy — talented, accelerating, visible — alone at a distance that would take me seconds to cross at full speed and minutes to cross at the speed that wouldn't level the landscape between us.

Unpractical. The word was sterile and accurate and insufficient.

I turned back.

At six hundred meters, the stream strengthened. At four hundred, it was half-baseline. At two hundred, full. At one hundred — stronger than full. The compensation effect: the qi that had been denied during my absence was returning AUGMENTED, as though my system was making up for lost output with the overproductive enthusiasm of a mechanism that had been told to stop and couldn't and resented the attempt.

By the time I reached the camp, the stream was flowing at what felt like a hundred and twenty percent of normal. More than before I'd left. The suppression — the distance — hadn't reduced the net flow. It had deferred it. Compressed it. Created a debt that my qi was now paying with interest.

Wei was stirring. Not awake — the middle state, the semi-consciousness that registered presence without processing it.

I sat. Where I'd been sitting when I left. The fire's ash hadn't moved. The morning light was the same. Nothing had changed except the data in my head and the weight that the data added to the growing collection and the collection was becoming an architecture and the architecture was becoming a prison and the prison was built entirely of things I knew and couldn't use.

The stream flowed. Stronger than before. Compensating. *Hungry.*

The word arrived without my permission. *Hungry.* As though the qi that connected me to Wei had a quality that exceeded physics and entered something adjacent to will. It pressed. It reached. It *wanted.*

Not my want. Not his want. The qi's own — the autonomous, independent, uncontrolled direction of energy that behaved as though it had been given instructions by something other than me and was following them with the fidelity of a system that couldn't be overridden because the override mechanism didn't exist.

I sat. The morning came. Wei woke.

"Were you up early?"

"No."

Another lie. Added to the collection. Filed beside the others.

The collection was growing. And each lie was a brick, and the bricks were building something, and the something had the shape of a wall, and the wall was between us, and the wall was invisible and he couldn't see it and I could and I was building it and I couldn't stop.

Like the stream.

Like everything.
