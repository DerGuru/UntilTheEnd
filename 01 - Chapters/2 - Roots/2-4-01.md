# Chapter 31

The foothills gave way to river country on the fourth day of descent.

Lower elevation meant warmer air, softer ground, the gradual return of vegetation that didn't need to fight for survival. Willows appeared along the banks — the long-limbed, lazy kind that grew where water was reliable and violence was infrequent. The sky opened. Sunlight hit the water and broke into fragments that moved the way sunlight on water has always moved: aimlessly, beautifully, without purpose or destination.

A good day. The kind that felt like nothing — empty of threat, empty of agenda, shaped by weather rather than will. The kind of day that, if you were someone other than me, you might describe as peaceful.

Wei fished.

This was his third attempt since we'd left the village. The first had produced nothing. The second had produced a broken line and a vocabulary of frustration that suggested his father's influence more than his mother's. The third — this one — he'd approached with the grim determination of someone who had elevated a minor task to a matter of personal identity.

A stick. A string. A hook made from a bent needle that he'd bartered for at the last settlement. The setup was crude. His technique was worse. He stood in the shallows, ankle-deep, his weight distributed incorrectly, his grip on the stick too tight, his qi leaking into the water and scaring every fish within ten meters.

I sat on the bank. Feet in the water.

This was — unusual. For me. I didn't touch things I didn't need to touch. The body I occupied didn't require temperature regulation or sensory input from its extremities. Putting my feet in a river was an aesthetic decision, not a functional one. A gesture of something I'd stopped naming centuries ago because naming it made it real and real things could be lost.

The water was cool. Clear. Alive in the way that running water is alive — moving, changing, never the same twice but always recognizably itself. It ran over my ankles and didn't know what they belonged to and didn't care.

I sat. Watched Wei. Watched the river. Let the sunlight do what sunlight does to skin that has been cold for weeks — warm it, slowly, in a way that is meaningless and irreplaceable.

"HA!"

Wei pulled. The stick bent. The string went taut. He leaned back — too hard, nearly fell, caught himself with a qi-pulse to his heel that cratered the riverbed and would leave a mark that the water would erase by tomorrow.

From the water came a fish.

Small. Very small. The kind of fish that other fish looked at with pity. It fit in his palm with room to spare.

"That's a fish," he said. Holding it up. Dripping. Triumphant.

"That's an argument against fishing."

"It's a START."

He held it higher. The fish struggled — silver, wet, panicking in the way that all caught things panic: totally, pointlessly, with an energy that exceeded any possible utility. Wei grinned. The grin of someone who had accomplished something that nobody else would consider an accomplishment and who was right to be proud and wrong to believe it mattered and somehow correct about both.

I almost smiled. The almost was enough.

He waded out of the shallows. Sat on the bank beside me — close, the proximity that had become habitual, the two-meter radius that he occupied without thinking about it and that I permitted without examining why.

He held the fish. Looked at it. The grin faded into something smaller — not less happy, but more honest. The expression of someone who was holding a very small fish and slowly realizing that holding a very small fish was, objectively, not a significant event in the history of cultivation or the trajectory of his training or the arc of whatever story he imagined his life to be.

Then his hands trembled.

A small motion. A shudder that ran from his wrists to his fingertips — the same vibration that had been present since the mountain, the same involuntary response that his body produced when his qi-channels processed more energy than his nervous system could translate into smooth motor control.

He set the fish down quickly. Into the water. It darted away — a flash of silver, gone.

"Too small," he said. "Wouldn't have been enough for both of us."

I said nothing. The lie was kind. Kinder than the truth, which was that his hands were shaking too hard to hold a fish the size of his thumb and that the shaking was getting worse and that I could feel — beneath the sunlight and the water and the careful nothing of this quiet day — his qi pulsing against the ambient field with a rhythm that was too fast and a pressure that was too high and a trajectory that I couldn't bring myself to name.

The river moved. The willows swayed. The light fragmented and reassembled on the surface of the water in patterns that meant nothing and resembled everything.

I kept my feet in the water. Not because it helped. Because it was the kind of thing a person would do on a day like this, and I wanted, for the duration of this afternoon, to be a person. Just a person. Sitting by a river. Watching a boy fail at fishing.

The wanting was the lie. But it was a good one.

Underneath, where the water didn't reach: his qi pulsed. Stronger than yesterday. Stronger than the day before yesterday. Always stronger than the last time I'd checked and never weaker and never stable and never, not once, settling into the plateau that training should produce and cultivation physics demanded.

*Not here. Not now.*

I pushed the thought down. Felt the water. Watched the light. Let the afternoon be what it looked like instead of what it was.
