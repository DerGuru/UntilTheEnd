# Chapter 20

The inn smelled like mold and old soup and the particular variety of human misery that comes from too many bodies in too little space with too few windows.

Wei loved it.

Three days of rain. His cough had returned — not the mild irritation of altitude but the productive, chest-deep hack that indicated moisture in his lungs and his body fighting it with all the tools available, which included qi-enhanced immune response and the simple, irreplaceable stubbornness of a constitution built on thirteen years of insufficient nutrition and excessive determination.

I'd chosen the inn. Not because I wanted to — the thought of walls and people and the specific social geometry of shared space made my skin feel too small for my bones — but because Wei needed a roof. Needed warmth that wasn't earned by shivering. Needed to exist, briefly, in the particular human ecosystem that inns provide: food prepared by someone else, noise, the ambient companionship of strangers who share a space without sharing a purpose.

Small place. A crossroads settlement — five buildings, a well, a stable that housed two mules and opinions about both of them. The inn was the largest structure by default, which meant it could accommodate perhaps twelve people if those people were all optimistic about the concept of personal space.

The innkeeper was a woman. Round, efficient, the particular brand of hospitality that consists of feeding people and leaving them alone, which was my preferred brand and probably the reason I'd walked past three other inns in three other settlements before choosing this one.

Wei sat at a table near the hearth. Warmth. Heat that came from a fire built by someone who understood fires and maintained it with professional attention. His face relaxed — the lines of endurance softening, the particular mask that constant travel builds dissolving in the presence of warmth and food and the temporary cessation of forward motion.

He ate soup. It was good. His expression said so — the particular widening of eyes that involuntary pleasure produces, the brief suspension of teenage composure in the face of genuinely hot food.

I sat across from him. Ate nothing. Drank tea — the cheapest variety, served in a cup with a chip on the rim, the tea that innkeepers give to guests who take a table and don't order food and contribute to the atmosphere primarily through the absence of trouble.

A merchant sat at the bar. Fat, loud, the kind of man who filled rooms with his voice because nature had given him the volume and habit had given him the audience and nobody had given him the awareness that not everyone wanted to be included. He was telling a story.

I hadn't been listening. The noise was background — the ambient human soundtrack that inns produce, the mixture of conversation and crockery and the occasional burst of laughter that sounds exactly the same in every inn in every province in every century.

Then Wei stopped eating.

"...the genius from the east," the merchant was saying. "You know the one. The one whose core cracked during ascension. Wanders the provinces like a ghost. Asks in every town about a woman."

I went still.

"What woman?" someone asked.

"A woman who stopped the sky, he says." The merchant laughed — the generous laugh of someone who enjoys his own stories regardless of whether anyone else does. "Stopped the sky! Can you imagine? The man's core is shattered and he's chasing fairy tales."

"Maybe it's not a fairy tale."

"Everything's a fairy tale until someone proves it isn't. And nobody's proved anything about a woman who stops skies."

Wei was looking at me. The steady, evaluating look.

"After a woman?" he said. Quietly. Not to the merchant — to me.

I stared at my tea. The surface was still. Reflective. A small, brown mirror that showed nothing useful.

"Go to sleep."

He didn't move. The look continued — the calculation running behind his eyes, the pieces assembling. A genius whose core cracked. A woman who stopped the sky. The connection between the two hanging in the air like something that both of us could see and neither of us was willing to name.

"Yun—"

"Go to sleep."

He went. Reluctantly, with the particular reluctance of someone who is obeying an order they disagree with because the cost of defiance is higher than the cost of compliance and they've made the calculation and it came out on the wrong side.

I sat alone. The merchant continued — other stories, other gossip, the endless circulation of rumor and half-truth that keeps the world informed and misinformed in equal measure.

A genius whose core cracked during ascension. Xu Ran. Wandering the provinces. Asking about me. Paying for information.

He was looking for me. Not for revenge — the merchant's description didn't carry the tone of pursuit or aggression. He was looking for understanding. For the answer to the question that his shattered core represented: What happened? And why? And what was it that he saw in that moment when the tribulation should have killed him and didn't because something impossible intervened?

I knew what he'd seen. I knew what he was looking for. I knew that he would find neither the answer he wanted nor the peace that the answer would have provided, because the truth was that there was no answer — at least not one that a human mind, even a brilliant one, even one that had touched Dao-Seeking and nearly ascended to immortality, could contain.

He would keep looking. The type always did.

I drank my tea. Cold now. Bitter.

The inn settled into the quieter noises of evening — low conversations, the fire's diminished crackle, the breathing of people who had given up on the day and were waiting for the next one.

I waited too. For what, I didn't specify. I'd stopped specifying a long time ago.
