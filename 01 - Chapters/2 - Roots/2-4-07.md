# Chapter 37

Wei knew something had changed.

He didn't know what. But he knew. The non-cognitive recognition of a shift in the person he'd been walking beside for months.

It happened on the second day after the failed suppression.

We walked. The hills had flattened into rolling terrain — farmland in theory, abandoned in practice. Fields gone to seed. Stone walls half-collapsed. The occasional foundation of a building that no longer existed above the level of its own ambition.

Wei walked beside me. Closer than usual — the proximity that tightened when he sensed something.

He stopped.

Not walking. Training. He stopped the cultivation cycle mid-breath. Stood still. The vertical line between his eyebrows — the one that appeared when he was processing something without vocabulary.

He looked at his hands. Turned them over. Palm up, palm down.

Then he looked at me.

"Yun?"

"What?"

He opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again.

"Nothing."

He turned. Resumed walking.

*Nothing.* The word that meant: I feel it. I can't name it. I won't ask.

His trust made the lie easier. And the ease made the lie worse.

We walked through the afternoon. The terrain gave us a stream — real water, cold, running between the abandoned fields. Wei knelt. Drank. Washed his face.

"My hands feel different."

I waited.

"Heavier. Like they're — full of something."

"Your channels are developing."

"Is that what it is?"

"That's what it is."

Half-truth. His channels were developing. Because I was developing them. The stream — my stream, the one made of qi and guilt — was doing what it had always done.

"Yun."

"What."

"You look tired."

"I don't get tired."

"You look like someone who doesn't get tired and is tired anyway."

I almost laughed. The almost lived in my throat for a second and dissolved.

By evening, the vertical line between his eyebrows had faded. But the question hadn't. It sat between us — quiet, patient, keeping pace.
