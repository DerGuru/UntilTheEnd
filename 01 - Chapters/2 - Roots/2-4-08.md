# Chapter 38

The child was sitting by the river.

We came upon it — him, probably, though age and neglect had reduced the distinction to academic — in the early afternoon, at the point where the trail descended to a floodplain and the river spread wide and shallow over stones that had been smoothed by water that had been running over them since before anything growing on either bank had been planted.

Small. Four, maybe five. The age where the body is mostly head and the head is mostly eyes and the eyes contain the entire history of everything that has ever happened to the person behind them, which in this case was short and already too long.

He sat on the bank. Alone. No adults in sight — not hidden, not nearby, not coming. Alone in the absolute sense. The kind of alone that doesn't wait for someone to return because no one is returning. Thin. Dirty. The clothes had been someone else's once — too large, torn, the particular kind of worn-out that exceeded poverty and entered abandonment.

Wei saw him first. Stopped. I felt the change in his qi before I saw the change in his posture — a sharpening, a focusing, the particular activation pattern that Wei's system produced when his emotional response and his moral instinct aligned and the alignment generated a force that was, in its own way, as dangerous as his cultivation breakthroughs.

"We take him with us."

Not a question. Not a request. A declaration. The tone that Wei used when he'd made a decision before the conversation started and was informing rather than consulting.

"No."

He turned. The look. I'd catalogued this look — filed it alongside the other expressions in the growing archive of Wei's emotional repertoire. This was Category 4: moral outrage, controlled. The kind that didn't explode but burned. Hotter than the explosive kind. More sustained.

"He's alone."

"Yes."

"He'll die here."

"Maybe."

"*Maybe?*"

I met his eyes. Held them. The thing about being four thousand years old is that you've seen every permutation of this argument. Every variation of the moral imperative. Every version of the child by the river and the stranger who wants to help and the companion who says no and the silence that follows the no that is heavier than any yes would be.

"We can't," I said. "We're being tracked. He'd slow us down. He'd make us visible. He'd need food we don't have and care we can't provide and he'd be in danger that he doesn't deserve because of a situation he didn't create."

Every word was true. Every word was a weapon. I used them with the precision of someone who had learned, across millennia, that the most effective way to win an argument was to be right, and the ugliest victories were the ones where being right didn't matter.

Wei's jaw set. The muscle in his cheek — the one that I'd been watching develop since the village, the physical correlate of a stubbornness that was cellular, structural, genetic — flexed and held.

"So we just leave him."

"I didn't say that."

"What then?"

I looked at the boy by the river. At the smallness of him. At the particular quality of his stillness — not the calm of meditation or the patience of waiting but the inertia of someone who had stopped expecting and existed, now, in the space after expectation, the flat empty territory where the capacity for disappointment has been exhausted and what remains is simply being.

"There's a farm. Half a li south. Smoke from the chimney this morning."

Wei looked at me. Looked at the boy. Looked south.

He walked to the child. Crouched. Said something I didn't hear — low, gentle, the voice he used with animals and children and the voice that, if I was honest, he used with me on the rare occasions when I let my guard down far enough for him to notice.

The boy stood. Looked up at Wei. The eyes — huge, dark, trusting in the reflexive way that very young children trust because they haven't yet learned the alternative. He took Wei's hand.

They walked. South. I followed.

The farm was small — a stone house, a garden, a few scrawny chickens maintaining the fiction of agriculture in a region that had given up on it. A man came out. Middle-aged. The face of someone who had endured enough to develop an opinion about endurance and whose opinion was negative.

"What?" the farmer said.

"He needs a home," Wei said. Direct. The negotiation style of someone who believed that moral clarity was a substitute for diplomacy and who was, statistically, wrong about this assumption more often than he was right.

The farmer looked at the boy. At Wei. At me. At the boy again.

"Not mine."

"I know."

"Feed's tight."

Wei reached into his pack. His hand found the pouch — the thin leather fold that contained everything we had in the category of currency. He opened it. Inside: one coin. The last one. The single remaining unit of monetary value that stood between us and the particular kind of vulnerability that comes from having nothing to offer a world that runs on exchange.

He held it out.

"Look after him."

The farmer took the coin. Looked at it. Looked at the boy. The calculation was visible — the moral arithmetic that every person performs when presented with a child and a coin and the question of whether the coin is enough. The arithmetic never resolves. People take the coin anyway.

"Come on, then," the farmer said to the boy. Not warmly. Not cruelly. The neutral tone of a man who was adding a task to his day and hadn't decided how he felt about it.

The boy went. Without looking back. Without releasing Wei's hand until the farmer's hand replaced it, and even then — a pause. A moment of two hands. Then one.

Wei stood. Watched the boy walk into the house. The door closed.

He turned. Walked past me. Back to the trail. His pack lighter by one coin and his expression heavier by something that coins couldn't measure.

"That's not enough," he said. Quarter of a li later. Not to me — to the trail, to the air, to the distance between what he'd done and what the situation required. "One coin. That's nothing."

"It's what you had."

"It's not enough."

"No."

We walked. The trail resumed. The river sound faded behind us. Wei's hands — empty now, lighter, freed of the last material thing he'd possessed beyond the clothes and the pack and the training and the stubbornness — didn't shake. For the first time in days, his hands were perfectly still.

I noticed. Filed it. Didn't comment.

The stillness lasted until nightfall. Then the tremor returned. And the stream flowed. And the pattern continued. And the coin sat in a farmer's pocket, buying a child a meal or a week or nothing, and Wei walked with empty hands and a full core and the particular weight of someone who had learned, at thirteen, that doing what you can is not the same as doing enough.

He would carry that. I knew — with the certainty of someone who had watched thousands of people learn this lesson and who had never, not once, seen anyone put it down.

Welcome to the inventory.
