# Chapter 14

Wei asked about the tablet twenty minutes later.

We were moving fast — not the full-speed disappearance I was capable of, but the enhanced pace that put distance between us and the clearing with the efficiency of controlled urgency. The forest had thickened again, the canopy closing overhead like a thought completing itself, and the light filtered down in fragments that made the ground a mosaic of shadow and warmth.

"They had your description."

"Yes."

"On jade. Not paper. Jade lasts."

"Yes."

"Someone spent months collecting that. Maybe years."

I said nothing. He wasn't asking — he was constructing. Building the picture from fragments the way he always did: observation first, question second, conclusion third. The analytical sequence that I'd watched develop over six months and that was, I had to admit, not bad for a child who'd had no formal education and whose primary intellectual model was a woman who answered questions with monosyllables.

"They'll send more."

"Yes."

"After these three report."

"Yes."

He walked in silence for a minute. His breathing was controlled — the third-step pattern holding, each exhale timed to his footfall, the integration of physical and energetic rhythms that experienced cultivators took years to develop and that he had achieved in weeks through a combination of natural aptitude and a training regimen designed by someone who had observed the process approximately ten thousand times.

"The tablet said 'dissolution of a Core Formation Tribulation through mental exertion alone.'"

I stopped. Not physically — I kept walking. But something internal halted, the way a mechanism stops when it encounters a gear it wasn't expecting.

"You read the tablet."

"I was sitting three meters away."

"You read classical Jade Path script at three meters."

He paused. "I... yes. Is that unusual?"

It was. Jade Path script was a cultivator notation system — compact, technical, designed for efficiency rather than legibility. The characters were small. The grammar was archaic. A literate Foundation Establishment cultivator would need to hold the tablet to read it. A thirteen-year-old village boy with four months of training should not have been able to read it at all, let alone across a clearing.

His channels. His perception. The enhancement was affecting everything — not just qi-flow and physical capability but sensory acuity, cognitive processing, the full spectrum of improvements that cultivation produced in practitioners who advanced through proper stages. Wei was getting all of them. At once. Without the graduated adjustment period that allowed mind and body to integrate each upgrade before receiving the next.

"It's fine," I said.

Another truth I wasn't sure about. Another reassurance offered because the alternative — explaining that his perceptual enhancement was accelerating beyond predictions and that the acceleration had implications I hadn't fully calculated — would help nothing and worry everything.

He accepted it. The way he accepted most of what I told him: with a nod that indicated receipt rather than belief, a filing rather than a processing, the behavior of someone who had learned to store my answers for later examination rather than evaluating them in real time.

He was getting smarter about that. I wasn't sure whether that was reassuring or not.

We walked. The forest held us. The scouts fell behind — their signatures dimming with distance, their triangle formation dissolving as the gap widened beyond their coordination range.

They would reform. They would report. And the jade tablet would be supplemented with new data: direction of travel, number of companions, the boy with qi-signatures that didn't match his apparent age. Each piece added to the catalog.

The world was building a file on me. Methodically, patiently, with the institutional persistence that outlasted individual curiosity and survived leadership changes and continued accruing data the way geological processes continued depositing sediment — without urgency, without drama, without stopping.

I'd been invisible for millennia. The invisibility had been comfortable. The comfort had been a luxury. The luxury was over.
