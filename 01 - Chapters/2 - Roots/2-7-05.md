# Chapter 66

The foothills became mountains. Not gradually — mountains don't do gradual. They do assertion. One day you're walking uphill; the next, the hill has decided it's a cliff and the cliff has decided it's a wall and the wall has decided that your opinion about its height is architecturally irrelevant.

Wei climbed well. His body was — I had to be honest with myself about this — remarkable. Not for the reasons that cultivation manuals would cite. Not the qi-throughput or the meridian capacity or the core density. Those were metrics. The remarkable thing was the integration — the way his body and his cultivation had merged into a single system, the way his muscles moved with qi-efficiency that I'd seen in cultivators three times his age and stage, the way he climbed a mountain like gravity was a suggestion he'd chosen to politely consider rather than obey.

He was also hiding from me.

Not the big things. Not the nosebleeds or the tremor or the midnight qi-surges that he thought I didn't notice and that I noticed the way I noticed everything, which was comprehensively, continuously, and with the particular attention of someone whose purpose — if purpose was the right word, and it might not be — was to notice.

The small things. The progress.

He'd developed three new compression techniques in four days. I could feel them — the subtle shifts in his qi-signature when he practiced during our rest stops, the minute adjustments in his core's harmonics that indicated structural changes, the kind of changes that took most cultivators weeks of guided practice and that Wei was achieving through independent experimentation in the margins of walking and resting and sleeping and not sleeping.

He wasn't showing me. Wasn't bringing them for evaluation. Wasn't asking for correction or confirmation or the teacher's response that validates the student's work and that students need because validation is the soil that growth requires and its absence produces growth that is vigorous and directionless and sometimes dangerous.

I knew why. The knowledge was the kind that arrived with its own guilt attached, pre-packaged, ready for consumption. He had learned — from me, by my example, through my lies — that certain categories of growth were handled privately. That the appropriate response to one's own increasing power was not celebration but management. That management was best performed alone, because involving others meant involving others' reactions, and others' reactions were unpredictable, and unpredictability was a variable that could be eliminated through the simple mechanism of not telling.

My method. My philosophy. Deployed by a thirteen-year-old boy with the precision of someone who had internalized the lesson without understanding the context and who was therefore applying it universally rather than selectively and who was right to do so because he had no framework for selectivity because the framework was the context and the context was "I am an ancient being whose enabling of your cultivation is slowly killing you" and that context was not available to him.

On the fifth day in the mountains, I tested him.

Not formally. Not a declared assessment with parameters and expectations. A simple exercise — the kind I'd introduced in the first weeks of training, basic enough that his current level should have made it trivial.

"Channel qi through the second meridian set. Sustained. Thirty seconds."

He did it. Clean. Perfect. The execution was so far beyond the exercise's intended difficulty that the exercise became a transparent excuse for assessment and he saw through it with the immediacy of someone who had been watching for assessment and who understood that assessment was my methodology the way storytelling was my defense.

"That was a test," he said.

"It was an exercise."

"It was a test. You're checking my stability."

I — did not deny it. The denial would have been a lie and the lies were a finite resource and the resource was depleted and the depletion was a problem and the problem was that I had used so many lies that the remaining ones had to be reserved for emergencies and this was not an emergency, this was a boy accurately identifying a methodology, and accuracy deserved honesty, even from me, even now.

"Yes."

He sat down. On a rock. The rock was the kind of rock that mountains produce specifically for sitting — flat-topped, stable, positioned by geological processes that had nothing to do with comfort and everything to do with the physics of erosion but that produced comfort anyway because the universe, despite its general indifference, occasionally manufactured convenience by accident.

"How am I?" he asked.

"Better than expected."

"Is 'better than expected' good or bad?"

"It depends on what was expected."

He gave me a look. The look of someone who had received a non-answer and who was running out of patience with non-answers and whose patience was a commodity that had been plentiful and was now scarce and whose scarcity was my doing.

"Your stability is decreasing," I said. Truth. The word came out with the specific gravity of a confession — heavier than normal words, denser, carrying the weight of all the conversations I hadn't started and the diagnoses I hadn't shared and the assessments I had made in silence and kept in silence and whose silence was its own pathology.

"I know."

Two words. The two words that changed everything and changed nothing. He knew. He already knew. Had calculated it himself, from his own data, through his own observation, using the analytical framework I'd given him — the one that treated symptoms as information and information as intelligence and intelligence as the basis for decision-making rather than panic.

"How long have you known?"

"Since the inn. Since the boy with the broken core showed me what 'worse' looked like."

Xu Ran as benchmark. Xu Ran as end-state demonstration. The boy who had been what Wei was becoming, whose broken core was the destination that Wei's trajectory was pointing toward, whose existence was a case study and whose case study Wei had read and understood and internalized with the terrible efficiency that was his gift and his curse and possibly the same thing.

"And you're still training," I said. Not question. Observation.

"The compression helps. When I suppress the signature, the pressure drops. Like — releasing a valve."

"Temporarily."

"Everything is temporary."

A sentence from a thirteen-year-old boy that contained more philosophy than most philosophers managed in a career. Delivered without the weight of philosophy — light, practical, the observation of someone who had noticed that things ended and had decided to work within the constraint rather than against it.

"You're right," I said.

He looked at me. Surprised. The surprise of someone who had expected resistance and received agreement and who didn't quite know what to do with agreement because our recent interactions had been primarily composed of resistance and its variants.

"I'm right?"

"You're right. Everything is temporary. Including the valve."

He understood. I saw it register — the implication that the compression technique, the suppression, the method of managing his instability, was itself a temporary solution and that the temporary would expire and that the expiration would be — what it would be.

He nodded. Stood. Picked up his pack.

"More walking?" he said.

"More walking."

"Good. Walking helps too."

It did. The physical exertion diffused the qi-pressure. Not a solution — a delay. But delays were what I had. Delays were the currency I was spending, buying time with the one resource I'd always had in surplus, and spending it now with the specific urgency of someone who had realized the surplus was finite and the finitude was new and the newness was terrifying.

We walked. Up. Into mountains that didn't care about stability counts or compression techniques or thirteen-year-old boys whose cultivation was a lighthouse and whose lighthouse was a signal and whose signal was attracting exactly the attention that we were climbing to avoid.
