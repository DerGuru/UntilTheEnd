# Chapter 71

Three days. Three qi-surges. The interval was shrinking.

I tracked it the way I tracked everything — clinically, precisely, with the detachment that wasn't detachment but a defense mechanism that wore the mask of detachment because the alternative was engagement and engagement with the data would produce a response and the response would be emotional and emotions were a luxury I could not afford because affording them meant paying with the only currency that mattered, which was composure, and composure was the structure that held the arrangement together.

Day one: surge at dawn. Wei woke gasping. Sat up. His core: visible through his shirt — the physical manifestation of qi-density, the glow that was no longer limited to sleep but was beginning to appear during transitions, during the moments between states when his conscious control was re-establishing itself and the gap between unconscious release and conscious suppression was a window and through the window the light poured.

He dampened it. Quickly. The compression technique he'd developed — three breaths, core locked, signature reduced. The glow died. He sat, breathing hard, hands between his knees. The tremor: hands and forearms now. Both. Continuous.

"Fine," he said.

"I didn't ask."

"I know. I'm telling you anyway."

Day two: surge at midday. Walking. No warning. His gait stuttered — one step wrong, the kind of wrong that wasn't clumsiness but system failure, the brief disconnection between intention and execution that indicated the nervous system had received a burst of contradictory input and had chosen the worst possible moment to fail to reconcile it.

He caught himself. Stood. Steadied. His nose: a line of red, left nostril, wiped with the back of his hand, the gesture that had become automatic, the maintenance response of a body that was accustoming itself to breakdown the way a house accustoms itself to weather — not by resisting but by adapting and by adapting not by choice but by the absence of alternatives.

Day three: surge at continuous. Not an event — a state. His core: vibrating constantly, the hum that I'd first heard that night at the fire now present at all hours, audible to me, invisible to him, the background radiation of a system that was exceeding its operational parameters and whose excess was becoming the norm and whose norm was the emergency.

Stability count: three.

The number sat in me like a stone. Three out of ten. Where ten was healthy and one was Xu Ran and zero was the space below Xu Ran that existed only theoretically and that I was no longer confident was theoretical.

I looked at him. Walking. Pack on his back. His stride: even, despite the tremor. His face: focused, despite the pain. His presence: defiant, despite the data. He walked the way people walk when walking is the one thing they can still do correctly and correctness is the island they stand on while the water rises and the water is patient and the patient water is the worst kind.

He laughed.

At a bird. A mountain bird — small, brown, the kind of bird that existed in large populations and small ambitions and that achieved its goals daily and whose goals were insects and altitude and the ongoing project of being a bird. This particular bird had collided with a pine branch, overcorrected, spiraled in a way that was aerodynamically improbable, and landed on a rock with the expression of a creature that was pretending the landing was intentional and whose pretense convinced no one.

Wei laughed. The sound was — I don't have the right framework. The sound was the sound of a thirteen-year-old boy watching a bird fail at flying and finding it funny and the finding was genuine and the genuine was a thing I hadn't heard in weeks because weeks had been serious and seriousness had colonized the space that laughter used to occupy and the colonization had been thorough until this moment when a bird hit a branch and the colony broke and the laugh emerged and the emergence was—

Beautiful. The word again. I was using it more often, I noticed. Using it for things that were small and temporary and human. Using it for the things that I was losing, whose loss I could measure because the measurement was my nature, and whose measurement made the loss precise, and precision made it worse, and worse was the direction everything was going.

"You're staring," he said.

"I was watching the bird."

"The bird left."

"Then I was watching where the bird was."

He gave me a look. The look of someone who found the answer amusing and who was allowing the amusement because amusement was a gift he could give and giving was a thing he hadn't done in weeks and the not-giving had been a statement and the statement's temporary suspension was itself a statement and statements from Wei were always layered and the layers were always more complex than his years should have allowed.

He walked. I walked.

Glass. The word surfaced in my mind — uninvited, accurate, unwelcome. The Leitmotif that had been gathering since the first signs, since the early misalignments, since the exponential trajectory became visible. Glass and light. Wei was glass — clear, strong, luminous, and fragile. The strength and the fragility were the same property, which was the property of a material that was both transparent and breakable and whose transparency made the breaking visible and whose visibility made the breaking unbearable.

Xu Ran had been glass. His core had sounded like glass when it cracked — I'd heard the reports, tracked the resonance. Glass that broke. Glass that shattered. Glass that went from whole to pieces in the time between one breath and the next.

I looked at Wei. Saw: glass. Saw: light inside the glass. Saw: cracks — not physical, not yet, but structural, the precursor fractures that preceded the break, the warnings that materials science provided to engineers who knew how to read them and that I knew how to read because I had read them five times before and the reading was the same and the conclusion was the same and the conclusion was—

"We're going to the mountains," I said.

"We're already in the mountains."

"Higher. Deeper. Into the range."

"Why?"

The question. Again. Always. The question that demanded a reason and whose reason was the truth and whose truth was the thing I was protecting him from and whose protection was the lie and whose lie was the foundation and whose foundation was—

"Because out there, nobody is," I said.

"And if I—" He stopped. The same broken sentence from before. The same unfinished thought. "If I—"

"Then we're alone."

"That's what you said last time."

"The answer hasn't changed."

He looked at me. Long. The look had — had something in it that I recognized from a distance, from across the gap that was forming between us, from across the riss that was widening. Not trust. Not suspicion. Something in between. The specific emotional frequency of a person who wanted to believe and who was running out of reasons to and who was holding on not to the belief but to the wanting, because the wanting was the last thing that didn't require evidence.

"Okay," he said.

"Okay."

We walked west. Into the mountains. Into the deeper range where the air was thin and the rock was bare and the isolation was a geography rather than a metaphor. Where nobody was. Where the nobody-ness was the safety, and the safety was the thing I could still provide, and the providing was the last function I was performing correctly, and the correctly was — was—

Three. Out of ten. And falling.
