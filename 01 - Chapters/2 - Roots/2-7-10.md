# Chapter 71

Three days. Three qi-surges. The interval was shrinking.

Day one: surge at dawn. Wei woke gasping. His core visible through his shirt — the glow no longer limited to sleep. He dampened it. Three breaths, core locked, signature reduced. Sat breathing hard, hands between his knees. Tremor: hands and forearms now. Both. Continuous.

"Fine," he said.

"I didn't ask."

"I know. I'm telling you anyway."

Day two: surge at midday. Walking. No warning. His gait stuttered — the brief disconnection between intention and execution. He caught himself. Stood. Steadied. Nose: a line of red, left nostril, wiped with the back of his hand.

Day three: surge at continuous. Not an event — a state. His core vibrating constantly, the hum now present at all hours.

Stability count: three.

Three out of ten. Where ten was healthy and one was Xu Ran.

He laughed.

At a bird. Small, brown, mountain bird — collided with a pine branch, overcorrected, spiraled improbably, and landed on a rock with the expression of a creature pretending the landing was intentional.

Wei laughed. The sound of a thirteen-year-old boy watching a bird fail at flying and finding it funny. Genuine. A thing I hadn't heard in weeks.

"You're staring," he said.

"I was watching the bird."

"The bird left."

"Then I was watching where the bird was."

He gave me a look. The look of someone who found the answer amusing and was allowing the amusement — a gift.

Glass. The word surfaced uninvited. The Leitmotif gathering since the early misalignments. Glass and light. Wei was glass — clear, strong, luminous, and fragile. The strength and the fragility were the same property. Transparent and breakable. And the transparency made the breaking visible.

Xu Ran had been glass. His core had sounded like glass when it cracked.

I looked at Wei. Saw: glass. Saw: light inside the glass. Saw: cracks — not physical, not yet, but structural. The precursor fractures that preceded the break.

"We're going deeper into the range," I said.

"We're already in the mountains."

"Higher. Deeper."

"Why?"

"Because out there, nobody is."

"And if I—" He stopped. The same broken sentence. The same unfinished thought. "If I—"

"Then we're alone."

"That's what you said last time."

"The answer hasn't changed."

He looked at me. Long. Wanting to believe. Running out of reasons. Holding on not to the belief but to the wanting.

"Okay," he said.

"Okay."

We walked west. Into the deeper range where the air was thin and the rock was bare.

Three. Out of ten. And falling.
