# Chapter 57

The memory arrived while I climbed the stairs.

*"What are you?"*

The question. Always the same words from different mouths across different centuries.

The inn was quiet. Late enough that even the drinkers had surrendered. I climbed. One step at a time. My body performing the ascent, my mind no longer in the inn.

It was in a library. Six thousand years ago.

He was a philosopher. Not a title he'd chosen — a condition he'd developed. A mind that couldn't stop asking, in institutions that couldn't stop answering, and the deficit between the two had produced someone who understood that all available answers were insufficient and kept asking anyway.

He was thin. The thinness of thought rather than deprivation. He sat surrounded by scrolls. Thousands. Every attempt humanity had made to articulate the nature of reality in a language reality had never agreed to be described in.

He looked up. Saw me. Didn't flinch. Most people flinched before they understood why. He didn't because he had no categories left. He'd dissolved them — systematically, deliberately — and sat in the wreckage with the serene discomfort of someone who had destroyed his own shelter because the shelter was inaccurate.

"What are you?" First sentence. No greeting.

I sat down. Among his scrolls. And I answered.

I told him pieces of truth. About time. About qi. About the structure of the world as I perceived it, which was not the structure his scrolls described — because his scrolls were written by people inside the painting, and I was someone who could see the frame.

He listened. Days. Weeks.

He understood. That was the problem. Other minds filtered what I said — the limitations acting as protection. He didn't filter. His mind was a receiver with no walls, a channel with no valves.

The first month, he was brilliant. The connections he drew between what I'd told him and what his scrolls contained were the most impressive intellectual performances I'd witnessed in a millennium.

The second month, he was quiet.

The third month, he was still.

The fourth month, he was empty.

Not dead. Empty. He breathed. He ate when food was placed in front of him. But the light behind his eyes was gone. He had understood everything, and understanding everything had left a mind designed for questions with no questions left. A mind with no questions is a mind with no motion.

I left. He remained. Among his scrolls. Existing — the verb that remained when all the others had been removed.

*He got his answer. Afterward, he wished he hadn't asked.*

But that wasn't accurate. He didn't wish. Wishing required the apparatus that understanding had consumed.

Some questions are not questions. They are doors. And behind some doors is nothing you want to see.

*"I don't know"* is sometimes the kindest answer. Not because it's true — because it's survivable.

---

I reached the top of the stairs.

Xu Ran had asked the same question. And I had given him the survivable answer.

Wei was sleeping. His core glowed — faint, warm.

I opened the door. Sat.

The stream flowed.

The inn settled. The night continued.
