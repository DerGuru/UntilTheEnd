# Chapter 72

The road ended.

Not metaphorically — physically. The track we'd been following, the goat path that had pretended to be a trail that had pretended to be a road, narrowed to a line, narrowed to a suggestion, narrowed to nothing. Rock. Grass. Sky. The mountain's surface, bare, offering no guidance about direction because direction was a human concept and the mountain was not human and was not obligated to participate in human navigation.

Wei stood at the boundary between trail and not-trail. Pack on his back. His hair moving in wind that tasted of altitude and emptiness and the particular flavor of places where breath was a negotiation rather than a given.

He looked at the mountains.

I looked at the mountains.

"Mountains," he said.

"Mountains," I said.

That was enough. That was the conversation. Two people looking at the same thing and naming it and the naming being sufficient because naming was acknowledgment and acknowledgment was presence and presence was the thing that remained when everything else — trust, certainty, the comfortable fiction of understanding — had been eroded by months of walking and lying and not-lying and the specific gravity of all the things unsaid.

Behind us: everything we'd left. A village that feared him. A road that remembered us. An inn where three sects had converged in three days to ask questions about a woman and a boy who had been there and were gone. A legend — the Black Moor, the southern trail, the story I'd planted in a garrulous innkeeper and that was propagating through the network of human conversation with the efficiency of a well-designed virus. An innkeeper who had a story. A merchant who carried it. Three sects who were acting on it — two following, one writing letters in jade.

A boy with a broken core, somewhere on a road, walking upright, who had said "I'll find you again" and meant it.

A hermit-master in a cave, writing questions on walls, whose presence I had felt for thirty seconds and whose thirty seconds had communicated more than years of conversation and whose communication I still couldn't decode and whose decoding I wasn't sure I wanted.

A flower that had bloomed and died in ten seconds on a stone by a stream, that had meant something, that had been something, that had been sent by something that I could not detect and could not understand and could not name and whose inability to be named was its primary characteristic.

Behind us: the world.

Ahead: mountains. And the particular emptiness that mountains provided — not the emptiness of absence but the emptiness of scale, the space that existed between peaks and that was large enough to contain everything without processing anything, the geographical equivalent of silence.

Wei walked forward. Into the mountains. Past the end of the trail. Onto rock that was just rock, that had never been walked on in any pattern that constituted a path, that offered itself as surface without suggesting direction.

He walked ahead of me.

This was — new. Not the distance. The distance had been growing: three steps, five, seven, twelve, fifteen. I'd been counting. I counted everything. Counting was the thing I did when feeling was the thing I couldn't afford.

But this was different. He wasn't walking ahead because of distance. He was walking ahead because he was leading. For the first time — the actual first time in months of travel — Wei was in front not because he had drifted there but because he had chosen to be there. The position was intentional. The intention was a statement. The statement was: I am going, and you can follow.

I followed.

The inversion was precise. Book One — if I were the kind of being that organized experience into narrative units, which I was not, except that I was, except that the organization was not my doing but the doing of something else and the something else was the thing I was not thinking about — Book One had ended with him following. In the dark. Through a forest. After a wave that had destroyed his village and a woman who had failed to prevent it. He had followed because he had nowhere else to go and because following was the only action available when the world had been reduced to one direction and the direction was "away from" rather than "toward."

Now: he was ahead. Going toward. The direction had reversed. Not because the destination had changed — we had no destination, had never had a destination, had been walking with the deliberate directionlessness of people whose purpose was not arrival but avoidance and whose avoidance was its own destination. But the orientation had shifted. He was facing the mountains. Facing the future, whatever the future contained, with the posture of someone who had decided that facing was better than following even when the thing being faced was unknown and the unknown was possibly worse than the known and the known was already bad.

His back: straight. Straight in the way that Xu Ran's back had been straight — the posture of someone who had lost things and who had decided that the angle at which they faced the loss was the one thing that was not negotiable. His pack: adjusted, balanced, riding high on his shoulders with the efficiency of someone who had been carrying weight long enough that carrying had become structure and structure had become identity.

His hands: trembling. Both. The tremor visible even from behind, even from the growing distance, the rhythmic oscillation of fingers that wanted to be still and couldn't be and whose wanting was the courage and whose couldn't was the condition and whose condition was the three-out-of-ten that I was tracking and that I was not telling him and that he probably already knew because he knew things now, this boy, this student, this person who had learned from everyone — from me, from Xu Ran, from the road, from his own body — and whose learning was comprehensive and whose comprehension was dangerous and whose danger was the enabling and whose enabling was me.

I followed him into the mountains.

The sun was low. The shadows were long — his shadow present, cast by sunlight, the normal shadow of a normal body that obeyed normal optics during the normal hours when his conscious mind held the gate and the gate held the light and the light held itself and the holding was the daily project and the project was sustainable and the sustainability was a question mark hovering over everything we did and everything we would do and everything we had done.

We walked.

No dialogue. No explanation. No plan. The arrangement stripped to its essential function: two people moving through space, one ahead, one behind, synchronizing their steps without discussion the way they had synchronized them through months of walking together, the physical habit of shared rhythm that persisted even when every other form of sharing had become complicated.

The mountains received us with the indifference that was their gift. No judgment. No expectation. No order imposed on disorder, no symmetry forced on chaos. Just rock and sky and the thin air that required effort and rewarded nothing and was honest about both.

Wei didn't look back.

I didn't expect him to. Looking back was for people who were checking, and checking was for people who doubted, and doubt was for people who weren't certain, and Wei — thirteen years old, trembling, glowing, breaking by a metric he might or might not know — Wei was certain. Not of the destination. Not of the outcome. Not of me. Certain of the direction. Certain of forward. Certain that the next step was better than the last step, not because the next step solved anything but because the next step was next and next was the only direction that time allowed.

I followed.

Behind us: a legend, three sects, a broken genius, a sealed letter, a dead flower, a story spreading south while we moved west. Behind us: lies and half-truths and the particular architecture of deception that I had built to protect him and that was doing its job and whose job was not the same as its purpose and whose purpose was love and whose love was a word I still couldn't—

I followed.

One step. Then the next.

The mountains.

The sky.

The boy ahead.

The being behind.

And between them: everything that had been said and everything that hadn't and the space between the said and the unsaid which was the story, which was always the story, which would always be the story, which was the only thing I had left to give and the only thing he hadn't asked for and the only thing that mattered.

I followed.
