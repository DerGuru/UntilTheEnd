# Chapter 72

The road ended.

Not metaphorically — physically. The goat path that had pretended to be a trail narrowed to a line, narrowed to a suggestion, narrowed to nothing. Rock. Grass. Sky.

Wei stood at the boundary between trail and not-trail. Pack on his back. His hair moving in wind that tasted of altitude and emptiness.

He looked at the mountains.

I looked at the mountains.

"Mountains," he said.

"Mountains," I said.

Behind us: everything we'd left.

A village that feared him. An inn where three sects converged. A legend spreading south — the Black Moor, the story I'd planted, propagating through human conversation. A boy with a broken core, walking upright somewhere, who had said "I'll find you again." A hermit-master whose thirty seconds communicated more than years. A flower that had bloomed and died in ten seconds and meant something I could not name.

Behind us: the world.

Ahead: mountains. And the emptiness that mountains provided — not absence but scale. The geographical equivalent of silence.

Wei walked forward. Past the end of the trail. Onto rock that had never been walked on in any pattern that constituted a path.

He walked ahead of me.

This was new. Not the distance — that had been growing: three steps, five, seven, twelve, fifteen. But this was different. He wasn't ahead because he had drifted. He was ahead because he was leading. For the first time. The position was intentional.

*I am going. You can follow.*

Something shifted. Behind my eyes, in my sternum, in the place where time folded wrong. A sensation like déjà vu but heavier — the feeling of a pattern completing, of a structure recognizing itself, of something clicking into a position that had been waiting for it. Vertigo without falling. The taste of metal, brief and sourceless. The wrongness that came from directions that shouldn't exist.

I let it pass. It passed.

I followed.

His back: straight. The posture of someone who had lost things and decided that the angle at which he faced the loss was not negotiable. His pack adjusted, balanced. His hands: trembling. Both. The tremor visible even from behind — fingers that wanted to be still and couldn't.

Three out of ten. And falling.

I followed him into the mountains.

We walked. No dialog. No explanation. No plan. Two people moving through space, one ahead, one behind, synchronizing their steps without discussion — the physical habit of shared rhythm that persisted even when every other form of sharing had become complicated.

The mountains received us with the indifference that was their gift. No judgment. No order imposed. Just rock and sky and thin air that required effort and rewarded nothing and was honest about both.

Wei didn't look back.

I followed.

One step. Then the next.

The mountains.

The sky.

The boy ahead.

The being behind.

I followed.
