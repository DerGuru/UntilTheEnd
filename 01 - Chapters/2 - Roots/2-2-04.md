# Chapter 13

The Jade Tablet changed everything.

We found them — or they found us, or chance produced the intersection that neither party had sought, though I suspected chance had less to do with it than methodology. A forest clearing. The kind of space that mountain trails sometimes opened into without warning — a gap in the canopy, a level patch of earth, the accidental architecture of vegetation that had decided, collectively, to grow somewhere else.

Wei was eating. His rice had improved — still burned at the edges, but the center was cooked now, and the herbs he'd mixed in had graduated from "medicinal" to "almost flavoring." He sat cross-legged on a fallen log, his bowl balanced on one knee, his chopsticks moving with the focused intensity of someone who was hungry enough to eat anything and proud enough to eat it properly.

Three figures stepped from the trees.

Not stumbled. Not emerged. Stepped — the deliberate entrance of people who had been watching from the treeline and had chosen this moment to reveal themselves. Formation: a triangle, the lead figure slightly ahead, the flanks a half-step back. Practiced. The choreography of approach that organizations teach when they want their agents to project capability and restraint simultaneously.

The lead figure was thin. Narrow-faced, narrow-shouldered, narrow in the particular way that some people are narrow — as if they'd been designed for efficiency rather than presence and had accepted the design without complaint. His robes were plain. His qi-signature was Spirit Gathering: competent, controlled, unremarkable. What was remarkable was his hands — long-fingered, steady, holding a jade tablet the way a magistrate holds an edict.

They knelt.

All three. Simultaneously. The synchronized genuflection of people who had practiced this — knee, fist to ground, head bowed — until the movement was muscle memory and the submission it represented was as automatic as breathing.

"Honored Elder. The Jade Path Sect requests an audience."

Wei stopped chewing. Rice hung from his chopstick. He stared.

I looked at them the way you look at ants that have marched into your kitchen and formed a line to your sugar bowl. Not angry. Not threatened. Something closer to the weary recognition that the natural world produces inconveniences that are too small to destroy and too persistent to ignore.

Needle — that's what I'd call the lead figure, because his face was a needle and his voice was a needle and his entire existence had the quality of something designed to be sharp and thin and exactly precise enough to be irritating — Needle raised the jade tablet.

I looked at it.

The inscription was meticulous. Carved by someone with a steady hand and an organized mind and access to information that should have been impossible to compile. My height. My build. The approximate age of my appearance. The absence of a readable qi-signature. The last confirmed location — Dong valley, six months ago.

And at the bottom, in smaller characters:

*Documented action: dissolution of a Core Formation Tribulation through mental exertion alone.*

They'd cataloged me. Not guessed, not rumored, not approximated — cataloged. With the systematic precision of an organization that collects data the way a farmer collects grain: patiently, thoroughly, as raw material for decisions yet to be made.

The tablet was worse than an army. An army meant someone had decided. A catalog meant someone was still deciding — gathering, organizing, building the case for whatever conclusion the data would eventually support.

Wei swallowed his rice. Looked at the tablet. Looked at the three kneeling figures. Looked at me.

"You're kneeling to the wrong person. She never sits still long enough for that."

Silence. Needle's face twitched — confusion, the micro-expression of someone who had prepared for deference or hostility or even indifference and had not prepared for commentary from a thirteen-year-old with rice on his chin.

My mouth almost moved. Almost. The smallest contraction of the muscle at the corner — the involuntary response to unexpected comedy that I'd been suppressing for centuries and that Wei, somehow, kept triggering without effort.

I filed it. The way I filed everything about Wei that didn't fit the behavior model I'd constructed — into the growing folder of observations that I would examine later, or never, depending on which option threatened my equilibrium less.

The flankers exchanged glances. Needle recovered.

"Honored Elder, please—"

I stood up. Wei stood up. His rice bowl, abandoned on the log, tilted and dripped broth onto the bark.

I turned. Walked toward the trees.

"Honored Elder, the Jade Path Sect means no—"

I was already between the trunks. Wei was behind me. Needle's voice followed us into the forest — growing fainter, more desperate, the particular desperation of a man who had been given a mission and was failing it in real time and could feel the future consequences assembling behind him like weather.

We walked. Didn't run. Running would have dignified the encounter with urgency it didn't deserve.

Behind us, three men knelt in an empty clearing next to a fallen log with rice dripping from an overturned bowl, and wondered what they'd done wrong.
