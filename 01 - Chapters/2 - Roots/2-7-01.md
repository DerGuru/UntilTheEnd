# Chapter 62

Spring arrived without asking permission.

It came the way spring comes in the northern provinces — abruptly, aggressively, with the botanical equivalent of a door kicked open. One day: bare branches, mud, the persistent gray of a world that had committed to winter and was reluctant to renegotiate. The next: blossoms. White, pink, an assertive yellow that bordered on confrontational. The air: warm, sudden, full of pollen and the opinions of birds who had been quiet for months and were making up for the silence with interest.

Wei stood on the road. Pack on his back. Face tilted up. Eyes closed.

"Spring," he said.

I looked at the blossoms. Saw them. Saw through them to the last time I'd seen this particular species bloom — four hundred years ago, in a garden that no longer existed, tended by a woman who no longer existed, in a province that had changed names three times since and would change again. The blossoms didn't know. They bloomed with the cheerful indifference of things that repeated and whose repetition was not memory but biology and whose biology was more honest than memory because biology didn't pretend to learn from the past.

We walked. The road was wider here — the northwest pass, well-maintained, the kind of road that governments built when they wanted to demonstrate governance and that travelers used when they wanted to demonstrate the existence of destinations. Trees on both sides. The particular green of new leaves, which was a green that hadn't yet been weathered into the darker, quieter green of experience.

I had noticed it at dawn.

The bandage.

Wei's left forearm, wrapped in cloth and herbs, tied with a knot that was competent and careful and that had been learned from me — I'd taught him wound care in the second week of travel, the practical education that living on a road required — and that had been applied not by me but by himself, alone, in the dark, before I was awake.

Or before he thought I was awake. I was always awake. But he didn't know that, because I'd never told him, because telling him would have raised questions about the nature of a being that didn't sleep, and those questions were in the category of things I was deferring, and the deferral list was getting long.

The bandage covered a cut. Not deep — I could see the edges through the cloth, feel the minimal qi-disruption that indicated broken skin and minor tissue damage. The kind of wound that happened during muscle seizure. During a qi-surge that contracted the body's systems faster than the body could accommodate. During an episode that happened at night, in the dark, while I sat four meters away and did not intervene because I did not know it was happening because he had hidden it.

He had hidden it.

The sentence required repetition because the fact required processing. Wei — who had, until three weeks ago, brought every scrape and bruise and splinter to me with the transparent expectation of attention — had experienced a qi-episode, injured himself, treated the injury, and concealed all of it. From me.

Not concealed. That implied active deception. He had simply — not mentioned it. Not shown it. Not brought it. The absence of disclosure rather than the presence of dishonesty. The passive form of secrecy, which was more dangerous than the active form because the active form was a decision and decisions could be confronted and the passive form was a pattern and patterns grew underground and emerged only when they were too large for intervention.

I saw the bandage. Said nothing. Waited for him to mention it. He didn't.

He walked. Spring-bright. Smiling at the blossoms. His left arm at his side, the forearm angled slightly — the angle of someone favoring a wound, protecting it from brush and branch, the minor adjustment that the body makes automatically when instructed to compensate and that was visible to anyone who knew what compensation looked like and I knew what compensation looked like because I had been watching compensation for millennia.

This was my fault.

The thought was clear, specific, architectural. This — Wei's silence, Wei's self-treatment, Wei's failure to bring the wound to me — was a structure built on a foundation I had laid. The first lie. "Too much qi through immature channels." The lie that had taught him: some things are handled alone. The lie that had demonstrated: your body's failures are manageable, clinical, contained. The lie that had, through its competence and its calm delivery, communicated a model of response that Wei had internalized and was now applying to his own symptoms with the terrifying efficiency of a student who learns not what is taught but how it is taught.

I had taught him to handle it alone. By handling it alone. By not telling him. By treating his condition as a problem to be managed rather than a truth to be shared. And he had learned. And the learning was perfect. And the perfection was a mirror and the mirror showed me my own methods reflected back in a thirteen-year-old boy who had adopted my coping strategy without adopting my reasons and whose adoption was therefore purer, more committed, more dangerous.

"Your arm," I said. Three hours into the walk. When the silence had become a statement and the statement had become a pressure and the pressure had become unbearable, which was a word I used rarely and meant precisely.

He glanced at it. "Caught it on a branch. Last night."

A lie. Small. Clinical. Delivered with the specific casualness that I recognized because I had invented the specific casualness, had deployed it hundreds of times, had perfected the art of making truth-adjacent statements that occupied the space where honesty should be and that were close enough to accurate that challenging them required an aggression that the questioner typically chose not to exercise.

"Let me look at it."

"It's fine."

"Wei."

"It's fine, Yun."

The use of my name. Not "hey" or "listen" or the wordless gesture that usually preceded a request. My name. Deployed as a boundary marker. The linguistic equivalent of a closed door, used by a thirteen-year-old boy who had learned that names could be boundaries and that boundaries could be erected and that erection was a right and the right was not negotiable.

I didn't push. I should have pushed. Pushing was the function, the responsibility, the thing that the adult in the arrangement was supposed to do when the child in the arrangement was making decisions that were locally rational and globally catastrophic.

I didn't push because pushing would have required explaining why the branch story was insufficient. And explaining why would have required admitting what I knew. And admitting what I knew would have required revealing what I was. And the chain of causation was long and each link was heavier than the last and the weight was not in the links but in the destination, which was a conversation I could not have and would not have and was therefore avoiding with the comprehensive dedication of someone who had made avoidance a practice and whose practice was beginning to produce consequences and whose consequences were bandaged in cloth and herbs on the arm of a boy who had learned to handle things alone.

We walked. Spring continued its project. The road ahead curved northwestward, toward the mountains that were visible now — gray, distant, patient, the geological patience of things that measured time in epochs and found human urgency amusing.

Wei walked ahead of me. By three steps. Then five. Then seven.

I followed.
