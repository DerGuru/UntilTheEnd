# Chapter 16

The knowing came without invitation.

Morning. A plateau stripped of trees by wind and altitude. Wei was asleep — wrapped in his jacket, curled against a rock outcrop that offered minimal shelter from the predawn cold. His breath made small clouds. His qi pulsed in the third-step pattern. His hands, tucked against his chest, were still.

I was packing. Mechanically — the routine of breaking camp that had become ritual through repetition, each action assigned its place in the sequence, each object returning to its container in the order dictated by six weeks of identical mornings.

Then I knew.

The Iron Lotus Sect. Three days east. On the pass above the Lin valley — the one with the broken bridge that made the crossing difficult for anyone who needed roads. Four cultivators: two Core Formation, solid and experienced; one Foundation Establishment, young, nervous; and leading them, a Dao-Seeking elder, the kind of presence that most organizations deployed only when they expected resistance and wanted the resistance to be brief.

I knew their formation. I knew their pace. I knew that the Foundation Establishment one had a knee injury from a training accident and favored his left side and would be the weakest point in any defensive perimeter they established.

I knew this the way I knew my own name. Complete, immediate, certain.

I stood still. The packing halted mid-motion — a water container in one hand, its cap in the other, the gesture frozen in the gap between mechanical routine and the sudden awareness that something had deposited precise tactical intelligence into my mind without using any channel I could identify.

I hadn't seen the Iron Lotus in two hundred years. I had no scouts, no intelligence network, no contacts in any sect that might relay operational information. My qi-perception, even unfettered, couldn't reliably read specific organizational details at a distance of three days' travel. This wasn't deduction. It wasn't pattern recognition. It wasn't the accumulated experience of millennia producing an educated guess.

I just knew.

I turned the knowledge over. Examined it. Prodded it the way you prod a suspicious object — carefully, from the periphery, with the awareness that what you're touching might have properties you haven't anticipated. It felt — solid. Real. The particular texture of genuine information, distinguishable from imagination or speculation by a quality I couldn't name and didn't want to.

"Wei."

He stirred. The alertness came faster now — three seconds from sleep to functional, the nervous system's adaptation to six weeks of uncertain mornings.

"What?"

"We're taking the west path."

He sat up. Rubbed his eyes. "We were going north."

"West."

"Why?"

The word hung between us. A reasonable question. A question that deserved a reasonable answer. A question that I could have answered with the truth — "I have unexplained knowledge of a sect formation on the east pass and the source of this knowledge is unknown to me and this concerns me more than the sect itself." — and chose not to.

"Instinct."

He looked at me. The steady, evaluating look that thirteen-year-olds weren't supposed to possess — the look of someone who was measuring the gap between what had been said and what hadn't and was deciding whether to press.

He didn't press.

"Okay."

We went west. The terrain shifted — softer hills, more vegetation, the particular landscape that develops in the rain shadow of higher peaks. Easier walking. Wei's cough improved. His color returned. The western route was kinder.

But I wasn't taking it because it was kinder. I was taking it because three days east, on a pass I'd never visited, four cultivators from a sect I hadn't encountered in centuries were waiting in a formation I couldn't possibly have knowledge of.

And I knew it. With certainty. Without source.

The word I'd given Wei was "instinct." It wasn't instinct. Instinct was vague, directional, the body's approximate response to environmental cues accumulated over a lifetime of experience. What I'd felt was precise. Specific. The kind of knowledge that came with citations, if citations were a thing that knowledge could carry.

Something was informing me. Something that knew things I didn't, saw things I couldn't, operated on a timeline and a data set that exceeded my own considerable range. Something that had access to my cognition and used it the way a scribe uses paper — as a surface for inscription, not as a participant in the writing.

I'd felt this before. In fragments. In the things I knew without learning, the reactions I had without deciding, the moments where my body moved before my mind authorized the movement and the result was always correct and the correctness was always unexplained.

I pushed it down. The way I'd pushed everything down for four thousand years — with the force of habit, the weight of practice, the particular skill of a mind that had turned self-deception into an art form and the art form into a survival strategy.

The west path. The easier route. The reasonable decision.

The reasonable decision that I'd made based on information that had appeared in my head from nowhere.

I walked. Wei walked. The sun moved across a sky that didn't care about the difference between instinct and something else. And I didn't think about it. I didn't think about it with the aggressive thoroughness of someone who was not-thinking very, very hard.
