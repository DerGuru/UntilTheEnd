# Chapter 41

The signature arrived at dawn.

I was awake — always awake, or awake in the way that my body performed wakefulness while the parts of me that should have been resting ran their calculations in the background. Wei slept. His core glowed through his blanket, steady, the warm pulse of a system that had stabilized temporarily in the aftermath of a forced march that had left his ribs bruised and his pride intact.

The signature cut through the ambient field the way a blade cuts through water — not displacing, not warring with the existing currents, but occupying them. Taking up residence. Claiming the space with the quiet authority of something that had been powerful long enough to forget what it felt like to arrive without changing the room.

Dao-Seeking stage. High Dao-Seeking — the upper register of the realm that sat just below Immortal and that required, for its attainment, a minimum of three centuries of continuous cultivation and a maximum tolerance for the particular loneliness that comes from being stronger than everyone you've ever met.

Not scouts. Not the methodical, cautious operatives who tracked by negative space and left qi-traces only because perfection was physically impossible. This was someone who didn't bother hiding. Someone whose presence was a statement, and the statement was: *I am here, and the fact that you know I am here changes nothing about what will happen.*

Iron Lotus Sect. The signature carried their school's fingerprint — the particular tonal quality that sect cultivation imprints onto qi the way an accent imprints onto language. Iron Lotus. Third-generation technique, refined, with the metallic undertone that their core method produced. I'd known this school for as long as it had existed, which was longer than its founders remembered.

I woke Wei.

Not gently — the way I woke him when the situation didn't accommodate gentleness. A hand on his shoulder, pressure, the nonverbal command that bypassed sleep and accessed the training routines I'd installed in his nervous system over months of teaching him that waking fast wasn't a skill but a survival mechanism.

He was up. Eyes open. Alert. The reflexes of a boy who had been running long enough to stop distinguishing between waking and fleeing.

"What?"

"We're not taking the pass."

He looked at the mountain trail ahead — the obvious route, the efficient one, the path that any rational traveler would choose because it was shorter and clearer and led to the lowlands where food was available and people were present and the infrastructure of civilization provided the illusion of safety.

"Why—"

"Now."

He packed. No argument. The trust that was automatic and the compliance that came from months of learning that when I said *now* I meant the situation had already deteriorated past the point where explanation would help.

We turned. West. Into terrain that was deliberately suboptimal — steep, overgrown, the kind of landscape that punished travel and rewarded hiding and that I chose not because it was good but because it was expensive, and expensive terrain filtered out pursuers whose commitment was economic rather than existential.

The rest house sat at the mountain's base. Small, smoke-stained, the kind of establishment that existed because geography demanded it — travelers needed shelter at the bottom of passes, and the quality of the shelter was determined by the ambition of the person who built it, which in this case had been minimal.

We entered because Wei's ribs needed rest and my options for rest were limited to places where other people's presence provided cover. Anonymous in a crowd. Invisible by being ordinary.

The crowd was sparse. Merchants — two, old, the kind who'd been running the same route for decades and would continue running it until the route closed or they did. A wandering monk with the particular serenity of someone who had achieved either enlightenment or indifference and didn't know the difference. Two farmers drinking something that smelled like it was made from regret.

Wei held a bowl of soup. Thin, over-salted, the culinary expression of an establishment that had given up competing and settled for existing. He ate. I sat beside him and didn't.

The merchants talked. The way merchants talk — not for communication but for commerce, their words a form of currency traded for the responses they generated, the information ecosystem of people who made their living by knowing things and distributing them.

"—the wanderer with the broken core. He asks in every town."

Wei's spoon paused. Midair. The particular stillness that indicated his attention had shifted from his bowl to his ears with the abruptness of a switch being thrown.

"Which woman?"

"No idea. But he pays in core fragments. Must have been someone important once."

Core fragments. The detail landed in me like a stone in still water — not loudly, not violently, but with the specific gravity of information that changes the depth of everything around it.

Core fragments as payment. The pieces of a shattered cultivation core — extracted, preserved, offered to strangers in exchange for information about a woman. Each fragment was a piece of Xu Ran's cultivation. A piece of his power, his identity, his fundamental capacity. He was paying for me with himself.

Spending himself. Coin by coin. Fragment by fragment. Getting weaker with each transaction, each town, each question asked and answered or unanswered, trading the substance of what he was for the chance of finding the woman who had — what? Wronged him? Saved him? Broken him? The categories blurred at his level of desperation, and desperation didn't distinguish between categories.

Wei looked at me. The look that said: *I heard that. I know that connects to you. I'm not asking because I know you won't answer and the not-answering is an answer and I'm filing it.*

I ate my soup. It tasted like nothing, which was accurate.

"Finish," I said. "We leave in ten minutes."

He finished. We left. The merchants kept talking. The monk kept being serene. The farmers kept regretting.

And somewhere, on a road I couldn't see and in a direction I refused to calculate, a man with a broken core was walking from town to town, paying for me with pieces of himself, getting smaller with every payment, and the getting smaller was my fault the way everything was my fault, and the fault was a weight and the weight was a number and the number was growing and I carried it because carrying was the only thing I'd ever been good at.

The qi-signature of the elder pressed against my awareness. Closer now. Half a day, maybe less.

I walked faster. Wei matched me. The mountains rose around us from both sides, and the pass we weren't taking faded behind us, and the signature followed.
