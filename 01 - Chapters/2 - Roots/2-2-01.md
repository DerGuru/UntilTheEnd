# Chapter 10

The road taught Wei things I hadn't planned to teach him.

Three weeks north. The mountains leveled into foothills, then rose again — a different range, older, the kind of geological patience that builds peaks grain by grain over epochs and doesn't care who walks on them. The trails were animal tracks and seasonal shepherd paths, narrow enough that we walked single file, wide enough that the silence between us had room to stretch and settle into something that wasn't uncomfortable so much as structural.

Wei trained while walking. The qi-circulation exercises I'd drilled into him in the village — they adapted. He'd found the rhythm: route the energy through the primary channels on every fourth step, exhale the excess on the downhill stretches, draw fresh qi from the ambient air on the uphills where the altitude made the energy thinner and cleaner and more responsive.

He stumbled over roots. Regularly. The dual attention — footwork and qi-work — was beyond his coordination, and the result was a particular kind of gracelessness that involved stubbed toes, muttered curses, and the occasional full stumble that he converted into a crouch and pretended he'd intended.

"Eyes on the path. Not on your qi."

"I can do both."

He tripped over a rock he'd been looking directly at.

"Clearly."

He didn't respond. Kept walking. His jaw set in the way that meant he'd heard me and disagreed and was going to prove me wrong by succeeding at the thing I'd told him he couldn't do, because that was the engine that drove him — contradiction as fuel.

We passed a village. Small — eight houses, a well, an old man on a stool who watched the road with the particular vacancy of someone who had stopped caring what passed by. Wei slowed. Looked at the structures. At the smoke from a cooking fire. At the normal, unremarkable evidence of people living lives that involved walls and meals and the specific gravity of belonging somewhere.

"I could buy rice."

I kept walking. "Too many eyes."

"It's eight houses."

"Eight houses talk. To traveling merchants. Who talk to towns. Which have cultivators."

He followed. The calculation had been delivered as fact, and he'd absorbed it as fact, and the village fell behind us with its smoke and its old man on his stool and its eight houses that would never know what had passed within a hundred meters of their walls.

That evening: fire. Small. Wei cooked — rice with dried herbs from his bundle. Burned at the edges, raw in the center. He studied the result with the analytical intensity of someone who was beginning to suspect that the problem wasn't technique but attention.

"That looks worse than it tastes."

He tried it.

"No. It tastes like that too."

I ate my portion. Wordlessly. Not because the food required silence — because Wei cooked and not-eating would mean questions and questions would mean conversation about why I didn't need to eat and that conversation was one of the several dozen conversations I was maintaining an active avoidance pattern around.

---

Later. Wei asleep. The fire banked to embers. Stars visible through a gap in the canopy — clear, cold, the mountain sky's particular brand of indifference.

I left.

Not far. Not long. An hour's walk south — at my pace, which covered the distance in minutes that would have taken Wei two hours. I moved through the forest the way I moved through everything: without disturbing it, without leaving evidence, without the particular violence that humans commit against geography simply by existing in it.

At a ridge overlooking the valley we'd crossed that morning, I stopped. Faced southeast. Extended my awareness — a fraction, the smallest possible output, the cultivation equivalent of breathing on a mirror to see if it fogs.

Then I built the trail.

A qi-signature. Subtle, layered, designed to read as authentic passage rather than deliberate placement. The energetic equivalent of footprints — not mine, but close enough to mine that a tracker who had a reference would lock on and follow with confidence. Southeast. Away from us. Into lower terrain, warmer valleys, the kind of landscape that a fleeing woman might choose if she were fleeing toward civilization rather than away from it.

It cost nothing. No energy worth measuring, no effort worth recording. The skill was older than the mountains I was standing on.

When I returned, I changed our route. Northwest. Steeper. The terrain that I'd been avoiding because it was harsh — exposed ridges, wind-scoured plateaus, the kind of landscape that punished travelers with cold and altitude and the particular misery of camping on stone.

Wei would notice in the morning. The air temperature dropping, the path climbing, the vegetation thinning from forest to scrub. He'd notice and he wouldn't ask for two days, then he'd ask, and I'd say something insufficient, and he'd accept it.

The cost wasn't the detour. The cost was what the detour did to a thirteen-year-old body that was still adapting to channels it hadn't earned. Colder nights. Thinner air. The specific physical stress that altitude imposes on systems that aren't ready for it.

I sat by the embers and listened to him breathe and heard the cough that was building in his chest — small, intermittent, the body's protest against conditions it hadn't agreed to.

The math was simple: his comfort, or our survival. I chose survival. I always chose survival. It was the one decision I was qualified to make and the one decision that never felt like a decision and always felt like an excuse.
