# Chapter 27

The crater was gone by noon.

Not hidden — erased. I'd spent the morning while Wei slept redistributing the displaced earth, resetting the uprooted pine (it would die anyway, but vertical was less conspicuous than horizontal), and smoothing the qi-residue that his outburst had deposited across the clearing like an energetic fingerprint. Tedious work. Not because it was difficult — for me, it was the equivalent of sweeping a floor — but because the necessity of it reinforced a truth I was trying not to examine: his outbursts were getting stronger. The cleanup was getting larger. The gap between what he could do and what he could control was not shrinking.

Wei woke with the particular stiffness of someone whose body is tallying the costs of the previous night's excesses and presenting the invoice. He sat up, winced, cataloged his injuries with the practical attention of a boy who had learned that damage assessment was a morning routine.

Bruises on his forearms. Abraded palms — the skin torn where qi had vented through his hands. A blue-black mark on his ribcage where the discharged energy had met the resistance of his own body and the body had lost the argument.

None of it was serious. All of it was there.

"Let me see."

He held out his hands. Obediently — the particular obedience of someone who knows they've done something that merits correction and is choosing cooperation as a preemptive defense.

I held his wrists. Felt the channels underneath — raw, slightly swollen, the energetic equivalent of muscle fibers that have been worked past their recovery threshold. His palms were warm. The qi beneath the skin was active — repairing, rebuilding, the autonomous maintenance function that his channels performed without input.

I fed a thread of qi into his system. Minimal — the smallest amount that would accelerate the healing without disrupting the natural repair process. His channels accepted it the way a dry garden accepts rain: immediately, completely, with the particular eagerness of tissue that recognizes what it needs and consumes it without reservation.

"Those are just—"

"Hold still."

He held still. I worked. Two minutes. The bruises wouldn't disappear — the cosmetic damage was already done — but the structural repair was complete. Channels sealed. Micro-tears mended. The internal architecture restored to its pre-outburst configuration, which was itself an improved configuration over the pre-previous-outburst, because each cycle of damage and repair was rebuilding him stronger and the rebuilding was part of the acceleration and the acceleration was—

I let go of his wrists.

"Starting today. Stabilization exercises."

He looked at me.

"Qi-steps in sand. Slow circulation. Breathing counts extended to eight, four, twelve."

"In sand? I just hit Foundation Establishment middle phase—"

"Slow."

"But I CAN do more—"

"Because you bleed."

Silence. He looked at his hands. At the torn palms, the fresh pink skin underneath where the healing had done its work, the evidence of a body that had exceeded its parameters and been repaired and would exceed them again because the pressure to exceed was structural, not volitional.

"...okay."

But the frustration was visible. Written across his face in the particular font that thirteen-year-olds use when their bodies are telling them they're capable of extraordinary things and the person they trust most is telling them to slow down and the contradiction between the two instructions is producing a dissonance that nothing in their experience has equipped them to resolve.

He wanted faster. The qi in him wanted faster — pushing against his control, pressing against his channels, demanding output the way a fire demands fuel. And I was saying: sand. Slow. Basics. The stabilization exercises that felt like regression because they were designed to consolidate rather than advance, to build width rather than height, to make the foundation reliable before allowing the structure to grow.

He didn't understand why. Not entirely. He understood "you bleed" — that was concrete, unarguable, the kind of reasoning that his pragmatic mind could accept because the evidence was on his palms. But "you bleed" was a symptom. The cause — the reason his qi was pushing harder than his development could accommodate, the reason the acceleration was producing instability rather than competence — that was something I could see.

The flicker in his core. The irregularity that shouldn't be there — a vibration, a wobble, the energetic equivalent of a structural fault line that hasn't produced an earthquake yet but is trending in a direction that earthquakes live. I could see it. I could measure it. I could calculate the trajectory with the precision of someone who had observed ten thousand cultivators at every stage of development and who knew, from data rather than intuition, what happened when cores vibrated at frequencies their bodies couldn't contain.

But addressing the flicker meant explaining where it came from. And I didn't know where it came from. Not yet. The acceleration, the instability, the autonomous cultivation that his body performed without permission — all symptoms. All pointing toward a cause that I hadn't identified and that, in the deepest and most honest part of my analytical mind, I was beginning to suspect I already knew and was refusing to confirm.

"Sand," I said. "Tomorrow."

He nodded. The nod that meant compliance without enthusiasm. The nod of a boy who was learning — slowly, reluctantly, through the brutal curriculum of experience — that the person who said "slow" might be more right than the body that said "fast."

Might be.
