# Chapter 30

The last night of the mountain.

We'd made camp at a place where the trees thinned and the ground leveled and the sky opened above us like something that had been holding its breath and finally exhaled. A clearing. Small. Natural — not cleared by hands or qi but by the particular geometry of root systems that had decided, collectively and without discussion, to leave this circle of earth alone.

Wei lay on his bedroll. Eyes closed. Not sleeping — the particular stillness of someone who was too tired to move and too wired to rest. His breathing was even. His core was not.

It vibrated. Low-frequency. The detuned oscillation that had been present since the outburst and that hadn't resolved because resolution required addressing the cause and the cause required understanding the mechanism and the mechanism was—

Forty-seven percent.

I pushed the number down. It surfaced. I pushed it down again. It surfaced again. We'd been having this conversation, the number and I, for three days. The number was winning.

I sat cross-legged, three meters from him. Close enough to intervene. Far enough to pretend I wasn't monitoring. The geometry of caregiving: near enough to matter, distant enough to deny.

His core pulsed. Once. Again. The rhythm was irregular — not the clean periodicity of healthy cultivation but the stuttered cadence of a system under load. Like a heartbeat with an extra syllable. Like a sentence with a word that doesn't belong but that the speaker can't stop saying.

I stood. Walked to him. Quietly — not that quiet mattered; I could have driven a cart over gravel and he wouldn't have woken, not in this depth of exhaustion. His body had reached the shutdown phase that cultivation stress produced: the point where the physical system simply stopped accepting input and went dormant and left the energetic system to run unsupervised and that was exactly the problem because unsupervised was the worst thing his energetic system could be right now.

I knelt.

Looked at him. At his face — round still, despite the travel, despite the cold rations and the altitude and the months that should have carved the childhood from his features and hadn't, quite. Round and slack and unbothered in the way that sleep makes everyone, briefly, the person they were before the world started happening to them.

I extended my hand. Placed it on his forehead.

His skin was warm. Not feverish — the warmth of a body that generated more energy than it consumed, the particular excess heat that powerful cultivators radiated and that in Wei's case had been increasing weekly. Warm. Alive. Present.

His qi met my palm.

A pulse. Gentle at first — the reflexive response of a sleeping cultivator's energy system encountering a known presence. Then stronger. The pulse pressed against my hand like something reaching. Like something that recognized the source my qi came from and moved toward it with the unconscious certainty of water moving downhill.

I felt it. The way it pressed. The way it was warm and alive and *wanting* — not wanting in the human sense, not desiring, but wanting in the physical sense, the gravitational sense, the way mass wants proximity and current wants ground and everything in the universe wants to flow toward the state of least resistance.

His qi reached for me with the blind insistence of a plant reaching for light. And for a moment — brief, unguarded, lit only by starlight and the faint luminescence of his core shining through skin — I let it.

The contact lasted three seconds.

In those three seconds, his core stabilized. The vibration smoothed. The irregular pulse resolved into rhythm. The detuned oscillation found its frequency and locked there, clean and steady, the way a struck bell finds its note after the initial chaos of impact.

Three seconds of contact and his system corrected.

I pulled my hand back.

The correction held. For now. The way a bandage holds — not healing, containing. Limiting damage but not reversing it. And temporary, always temporary, because the pressure that produced the instability was still present and still growing and the bandage was my hand and my hand was not a solution.

I stood. Stepped back. Looked at him from the distance that allowed observation without involvement, perception without participation.

"Schön," I said.

One word. German. Old habit — the language I spoke before I spoke the one I spoke now. The word that meant *beautiful* and that I used the way a doctor uses it: clinically, diagnostically, describing the particular terrible beauty of a system that was performing beyond its design parameters and would break because of it.

His core glowed through his chest. Faintly. A soft light, warm-toned, the color of late afternoon before it becomes evening. Visible through fabric. Visible through skin. Beautiful the way a star is beautiful — burning, unsustainable, incandescent with the energy of its own consumption.

"Tödlich," I said.

*Deadly.*

Two words. The complete assessment. The total diagnosis. Beauty and death, resident in the same body, inseparable, the way a blade's sharpness is inseparable from its capacity to cut.

I pulled my hand into my sleeve. The hand that had touched him. The hand that his qi had reached for the way a child reaches for the thing that feeds it. The hand that had, for three seconds, given his system what it was looking for, and in doing so had demonstrated something that I was not ready to examine.

I turned. Walked to the fire. Looked at the coals — barely alive, red heat fading to gray, the slow death of combustion that had used up its fuel and was reducing itself to ash.

I put my foot on the coals. Felt nothing. Extended a thread of qi and extinguished them — not for warmth management, not for concealment, but because the metaphor was too perfect and I didn't want to sit with it.

The dark came. Complete. The clearing went from dim to black, lit only by stars above and the faint glow from the boy behind me whose core was beautiful and deadly and reaching for something that it shouldn't have and that I shouldn't be.

I sat.

He didn't need protection from the cold. His qi-output kept his body temperature stable to within half a degree. A side effect of the excess. The excess that was a side effect of the acceleration. The acceleration that was a side effect of—

I stopped the chain. Deliberately. The way you stop a clock by removing the battery — forcefully, mechanically, with a violence that the mechanism doesn't notice because mechanisms don't notice anything and I wanted, very badly, to be a mechanism.

I sat. And didn't think. And succeeded, mostly, for about an hour. And then the number came back.

Forty-seven.

The last night of the mountain was quiet. Wei slept. His core glowed. The stars were indifferent. And I sat in the dark with two German words and a number I couldn't explain and a hand that remembered what it shouldn't have felt and a growing suspicion that the answer was worse than the question.

Morning came. We descended. The mountain released us into the foothills with the casual indifference of geography, and I didn't look back because looking back required turning and turning required acknowledging that I was leaving something behind, and I wasn't — I was carrying it, all of it, the way I carried everything.

In my hands, which were never empty.
