# Chapter 24

The cultivator appeared on the path with the particular lack of subtlety that comes from not expecting to encounter anything interesting.

He was young. Early twenties, the lean build of someone who trained regularly but ate irregularly, the kind of frame that cheap cultivation and cheaper meals produce. Spirit Gathering — low tier, the baseline of competence that separates cultivators from civilians. His robes were patched. His sword was blunt. His qi-signature was as remarkable as his appearance, which was to say: not.

He was walking south. We were walking north. The path was narrow — barely wide enough for two people to pass without one stepping off — and the intersection was inevitable.

He felt Wei before he saw him.

I watched it happen. The exact moment — his stride slowed, his head turned, his face changed. The transition from casual disinterest to focused attention, executed in less than a second, triggered by the qi-signature that Wei was radiating with the unconscious generosity of a candle that doesn't know it's producing light.

He stopped. Stared at Wei. At a thirteen-year-old boy whose qi-output read as Foundation Establishment — middle phase, whose channel architecture was more sophisticated than most Core Formation cultivators achieved in a decade, whose energy density was roughly triple what his apparent age and training period could possibly explain.

"Who trained this boy?"

The words came out in the flat, reflexive tone of someone who has encountered something that contradicts their understanding of the world and is reaching for explanation before they've finished processing the shock.

"That qi-flow pattern — that's impossible for his age."

I was behind Wei. Three steps, as always. My qi-signature was what it always was: nothing. The particular nothing that doesn't register as concealment or suppression but simply as absence — the void where a presence should be and isn't, the silence that a human mind slides over without realizing it has missed something fundamental.

He didn't notice me. They rarely did.

"Keep walking," I said.

The cultivator flinched. Turned. Looked at me — through me, around me, at me — with the delayed recognition of someone suddenly noticing a wall that had been there the entire time.

"Wait. Please. I've never seen—"

"Keep walking."

Wei glanced at me. I walked. He followed. The cultivator stood in the path behind us, his mouth open, his attention locked on Wei's retreating back with the hungry fascination of someone who has glimpsed something extraordinary and knows, with absolute certainty, that he will tell everyone he meets about it.

He would. That was the calculation I ran as we put distance between us and the gaping boy with the patched robes: every person he told would tell another person, and each retelling would add detail and subtract accuracy, and the signal would propagate through the cultivator community like smoke through a room — diffuse, pervasive, impossible to contain.

Wei was visible now. Not because of me — because of himself. His own qi, his own development, his own impossible advancement was producing a signature that other cultivators could read the way one lantern can see another lantern in the dark. And the lantern couldn't be dimmed. Not by me. Not yet. The control mechanisms that would allow him to suppress his signature were three cultivation stages away, and at the rate he was progressing, three stages was — what? Weeks? Days?

Too fast.

The phrase again. The refrain of this particular composition.
