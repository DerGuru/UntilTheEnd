# Chapter 49

He trained alone on the twelfth night.

I heard him leave. Fabric shifting, weight redistributing, the controlled exhale of a body trying to be quiet and succeeding at the level a thirteen-year-old could manage. Which was not a level that escaped a woman who could hear a moth's heartbeat at forty meters.

Twenty meters east. The Wei-defined radius of privacy. He'd chosen this distance before. He was consistent.

The stabilization exercises. My exercises. He performed them perfectly.

Not competently. Perfectly. Qi-circulation smooth. Channel distribution balanced. Core interaction stable. Every element executed with the precision of a practitioner who had passed the point of learning and arrived at the point of owning.

And his qi-pattern was clean. Cleaner than when I supervised. Because at twenty meters, the stream was weaker. The enabling effect reduced. His system was operating more autonomously — with less of my unwanted fuel and more of its own capacity.

He trained better without me.

The observation landed. Precise, clinical, devastating.

He trained better away from me. His qi was calmer. His channels more balanced. His core vibrated less. The exercises at twenty meters produced results measurably superior to results at three.

Because at twenty meters, he was training with his own qi, in his own channels, at his own pace.

He was better without me.

Forty minutes. Then he walked back. Lay down. Faced the forest. Slept.

His breathing was calm. His core steady. The tremor in his hands — present even in sleep — was marginally reduced.

The riss was quiet. But measurable.

Riss — the word I used because German was the language in which I kept my pain. A crack. A tear. The damage that occurs when two connected things begin to separate and the separation is not clean but jagged, not chosen but structural.

The fire was embers. The forest was the forest.

The improvement was proof of the problem.

The problem was me.
