# Chapter 28

I knew the number before I knew I knew it.

Night. The camp was settled — fire dead, deliberately, because fire meant light and light meant visible and visible was a commodity we could no longer afford. Wei slept three meters from the ashes, his body curled into the efficient fetal position that mountain travel teaches, his breathing locked into the third-step pattern with the mechanical reliability of a process that had been automated past the point of conscious involvement.

His core vibrated.

I could hear it. Not with my ears — with the part of my awareness that registered qi the way skin registers temperature: automatically, continuously, without the option of not registering. His core hummed. A low-frequency pulse, rhythmic, irregular in a way that deviated from healthy baselines by margins that were small enough to ignore and consistent enough to matter.

I observed it. The way I observed everything — sitting in the dark, legs drawn up, chin on my knees, my qi-perception extended to the boundary of his body where his energy field ended and the ambient field began. The interface was messy. His qi leaked. Not dramatically — not the explosive venting of the clearing — but steadily, the way a cracked vessel leaks water: slowly enough that you don't notice until the vessel is half empty and the floor is wet.

His core sat in the center of his dantian like a small sun in a too-large room. Bright. Younger than it should be — younger in the cultivation sense, the developmental age that describes how long a core has been active versus how mature its output appears. Wei's core had been active for months. It performed like years.

I watched it pulse. Watched the meridional flow — the qi circuiting from core to channels to extremities and back, the closed-loop system that defined active cultivation. Watched the lower dantian knot where the primary channel crossed the secondary and the flow bifurcated and rejoined.

And then I knew.

*At forty-seven percent qi-saturation, when the meridional flow passes the lower dantian knot, the core will generate a feedback loop. Duration: point-three seconds. In that interval, the core will resonate beyond the body's structural tolerance. It will fracture.*

The knowledge arrived complete. Not as deduction. Not as experience. Not as the product of four thousand years of watching cores and recognizing patterns and extrapolating trajectories from data. It arrived the way a document arrives — placed, whole, authored by something other than me and delivered to my cognition with the precision of typeset text.

Forty-seven percent. The number was exact. Not "around fifty" or "somewhere near half" — forty-seven. A number with the specificity of measurement rather than estimation. A number that belonged in a diagnostic report, not in a human mind observing a sleeping boy in the dark.

I didn't know that number. I couldn't know that number. The calculation required — the modeling of his specific core geometry, the prediction of his exact saturation trajectory, the simulation of the feedback dynamics at the lower dantian intersection — was beyond any practitioner I'd ever encountered. Beyond me. Beyond the theoretical frameworks that the most advanced sects used to model cultivation pathways. The math required didn't exist in any school of cultivation I'd studied.

But the number was there. In my head. Precise. Certain.

Forty-seven percent.

I shook my head. A physical gesture — the body's attempt to dislodge something that the mind couldn't process. The way a dog shakes water. Instinctive, useless, human in a way that I preferred not to be.

"No."

One word. Whispered. Not to Wei. Not to the dark. To whatever had placed the number in my head — whatever mechanism, whatever source, whatever intelligence was writing precision data onto my cognition like ink onto paper without my permission and without my understanding.

I pushed it down. Buried it. The way I buried everything — quickly, deeply, with the practiced efficiency of someone who had been suppressing inconvenient truths since before the concept of inconvenience existed.

The number didn't go away. It sat. Forty-seven. Present. Patient. The kind of knowledge that doesn't dissolve when you ignore it because it wasn't constructed from belief and therefore can't be deconstructed by denial.

Dawn. I hadn't slept. Hadn't moved. Had spent six hours in the dark with a number in my head and a boy breathing three meters away whose core was trending toward a percentage that I couldn't have calculated and couldn't explain knowing and couldn't stop knowing.

Wei woke. Packed. Ate cold rice from the previous night. The routine that had become ritual.

I stood. Stretched — not for physical need but for the appearance of normalcy, the performance of being a body that required movement after stillness. A fiction.

We walked. West, then north. The terrain cooperated — downhill sections, intermittent treeline, the kind of landscape that allowed distance without demanding suffering.

At the first crossroads — a place where two trails met and a stone marker indicated directions that nobody had maintained in decades — I stopped. Crouched. Looked at the ground.

Qi-traces. Fresh. Not from a sect — from scouts. Lighter than sect operatives, faster, the particular energetic footprint of professionals who specialized in tracking and who left traces only because complete erasure was physically impossible and they knew it.

They weren't following us. They were following the outburst. Wei's crater from two nights ago had been a beacon — a burst of qi-energy that had propagated through the ambient field like a shout in a quiet room. Anyone with detection capability within twenty li would have registered it. These scouts had. And they'd come to investigate.

Not our trail. Not yet. But the intersection between their search radius and our path was shrinking, and each of Wei's outbursts narrowed it further, and the narrowing was inevitable because the outbursts were inevitable because the pressure that produced them was structural and growing and I didn't know how to stop it.

I didn't know how to stop it because I didn't know what was causing it.

Or I did know. Somewhere under the number. Under the forty-seven. Under the precision data that had appeared from nowhere and that pointed, with the accuracy of an arrow, toward a cause that I was refusing to examine because examining it would change everything.

I stood up. Erased the qi-traces. Changed our heading — northeast, into denser forest, away from the scouts' convergence point.

"Why?" Wei asked.

"Scouts."

He didn't ask whose. He'd stopped asking whose. The answer was always the same and never helpful.

We walked. Northeast. Into trees that closed around us like something providing shelter. Or concealment. Or a cage. Depending on how you read the metaphor and how honest you wanted to be.
