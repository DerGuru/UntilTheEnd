# Chapter 22

The ledge where we made camp that night overlooked a valley that the mist painted in shades of blue and grey and the particular kind of nothing that high altitude produces when light runs out of surfaces to illuminate.

Wei was exhausted. The climb had taken everything his body had — and some of what his qi had, which was a different category of resource and a different category of depletion. He'd eaten his rice (improving — the burned layer was thinner now, barely a crust) and was sitting against a rock with his eyes half-closed, his breathing settling into the third-step pattern with the gradual deceleration of a mechanism winding down.

His hands trembled in his lap. He was too tired to hide it. The stick he usually carved was in his pack, and the distance between his lap and the pack was apparently larger than his remaining energy could traverse.

I watched. The way I watched everything — automatically, clinically, with the detached precision that had kept me functional across millennia by converting concern into data. Heart rate: elevated but declining. Qi flow: stable, channeled, the circulation running autonomously at a level that his conscious mind hadn't authorized and his body hadn't complained about. Core vibration: present. Low. The persistent hum that had been there since the flood and that I monitored the way a physician monitors a heartbeat — not because it was currently problematic but because the trajectory suggested it would be.

The trajectory.

That was the thing I couldn't stop calculating. Not the present — the present was manageable, contained, within parameters that allowed me to maintain the fiction that everything was developing normally, if rapidly. The trajectory. The curve that connected his state three weeks ago to his state now and projected forward into a future that the math described in terms I didn't want to accept.

He was accelerating. Not linearly — exponentially. The qi-flow refinement, the channel development, the involuntary cultivation that his body performed without conscious input — all of it was gaining speed. The gap between each developmental milestone was shrinking. What had taken weeks was now taking days. Soon it would take hours.

And I didn't know why.

That was the thing. The thing I couldn't admit, couldn't articulate, couldn't examine without encountering the particular wall of ignorance that was worse than knowing something terrible — because ignorance meant the terrible thing might be anything. Might be something I could fix. Might be something I couldn't. Might be the natural consequence of his talent reaching its expression. Might be something else entirely.

I watched him sleep. His face softened in the firelight — the jaw relaxing, the premature lines of hardship smoothing, the thirteen-year-old returning from wherever he went when he was awake and the world required him to be older than he was.

His qi pulsed. Warm against my awareness. Alive in a way that qi was usually alive — the background hum of an energy system in operation, the standard output of channels doing their work. But Wei's had a quality. A brightness. Something under the surface that pressed outward the way light presses against a lampshade — not escaping, not yet, but making its presence known through the fabric that contained it.

Beautiful.

The word arrived before I could stop it. An assessment. A recognition. The particular response of someone who had spent four thousand years observing qi in every form and magnitude and permutation and who could identify, without thought or effort, the rarest and most dangerous variety.

Beautiful. And the same way a cliff is beautiful — worth admiring from a distance that survival specifies and wisdom maintains.

I sat by the dying fire and did the math that I did every night. Channel width. Flow rate. Core density. Stability margins. The numbers that described a boy becoming something faster than any framework could accommodate and that I arranged in columns and compared to baselines and evaluated against standards that I'd developed over millennia of observation.

The numbers said: too fast.

The numbers always said too fast.

The numbers were beginning to say something else too — something I wasn't ready to hear. So I did what I'd done with every inconvenient truth since the first one: I folded the numbers and put them away and went back to watching the boy breathe.
