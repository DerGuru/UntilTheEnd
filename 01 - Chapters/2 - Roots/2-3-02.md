# Chapter 22

The ledge where we made camp that night overlooked a valley that mist painted in shades of blue and grey.

Wei was exhausted. The climb had taken everything his body had — and some of what his qi had, which was a different category of depletion. He'd eaten his rice (improving — the burned layer was thinner now, barely a crust) and was sitting against a rock with his eyes half-closed.

His hands trembled in his lap. Too tired to hide it. The stick he usually carved was in his pack, and the distance between his lap and the pack was apparently larger than his remaining energy could traverse.

"My fingers are buzzing."

I looked at his hands. The tremor was visible even in the firelight — fine, rapid, the kind that came from qi-overflow rather than cold.

"They'll settle."

"They've been buzzing since the ledge." He held them up, studying them against the fire's light. "It's not bad. Like... holding a jar of bees. Tiny bees."

"Don't circulate. Let the excess bleed off naturally."

He dropped his hands. Flexed them. Closed his eyes.

"Is this what it's like for everyone? The first year?"

"No."

He opened one eye. "Worse or better?"

"Different."

"You know that's not an answer."

"I know."

He almost smiled. The corner of his mouth — the left one, always the left — twitched upward and settled back. He was too tired for the full expression.

Wind moved across the ridge. Cold, carrying the smell of ice from higher peaks. Somewhere below, water ran through stone — distant, persistent, the background sound of mountains doing what mountains do.

His qi pulsed. Warm against my awareness. Alive. But Wei's had a quality. A brightness. Something under the surface that pressed outward — not escaping, not yet, but making its presence known through the fabric that contained it.

Beautiful.

The word arrived before I could stop it.

Beautiful. And dangerous. A cliff worth admiring from a distance that survival specifies and wisdom maintains.

He was accelerating. Not linearly — exponentially. The qi-flow refinement, the channel development, the involuntary cultivation — all of it gaining speed. The gap between each developmental milestone was shrinking. What had taken weeks was now taking days.

And I didn't know why. That was the worst part. Ignorance meant the terrible thing might be anything.

"Yun."

His voice was half-sleep. Blurred at the edges.

"What."

"Am I doing something wrong?"

The fire cracked. A spark rose, drifted, died.

"No."

"Then why do you watch me like that? When you think I'm asleep?"

I looked at the valley. At the mist. At anything that wasn't the boy who noticed too much.

"Go to sleep."

He went. His breathing settled into the third-step pattern. His hands, resting on his knees, finally stilled.

I sat by the dying fire. The numbers I calculated every night — channel width, flow rate, core density, stability margins — said too fast. The numbers always said too fast.

The numbers were beginning to say something else, too. Something I wasn't ready to hear.

I folded them away and went back to watching the boy breathe.
