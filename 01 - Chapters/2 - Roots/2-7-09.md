# Chapter 70

The Heaven's Order left marks the way bureaucrats left marks — systematically, comprehensively, with the particular thoroughness of an organization that confused documentation with understanding.

I tracked them for three days.

Not the people — the evidence. The symmetry in the landscape: regularized tree spacing, graded stone arrangements, the subtle qi-residue of cultivation practices applied not to combat or advancement but to ordering. To organizing. To imposing the sect's fundamental philosophy on the physical world — the belief that reality, left to its own devices, was disorderly, and that disorder was the root of suffering, and that the correction of disorder was therefore the correction of suffering, and that the correction was achieved through the systematic application of qi to the structure of things until the structure of things reflected the structure of the sect's ideology.

It would have been admirable if it weren't terrifying.

The marks were days old. Maybe weeks. Not fresh — the landscape had partially recovered, the way landscapes do, the natural systems reasserting their randomness against the imposed order with the patient persistence of things that had been random for longer than organizations had been organized and that would be random again after the organizations had filed their final reports.

But the trajectory was wrong. Their path — visible in the pattern of ordered terrain — was curving. Not south, toward the Black Moor where I'd directed them. Northwest. Toward the mountains. Toward us.

The false trail was failing. Or rather — the false trail was working exactly as intended, and they were following a different trail entirely. A trail I hadn't laid. A trail that wasn't a trail at all but a signal — Wei's qi-signature, the lightouse broadcast that his conscious mind suppressed during the day and that his unconscious mind released during the night and that traveled through the ambient qi-field the way sound traveled through air, attenuating with distance but never fully silent.

They were following the glow. The glow I'd seen three nights ago, the shadowless luminescence that Wei produced in sleep, the broadcast that was invisible to human eyes but visible to anyone with qi-perception above a certain threshold and that a sect dedicated to detecting disorder — a sect that classified anomalies the way libraries classified books — would have registered and catalogued and triangulated and pursued.

I needed more distance. I need more altitude. I needed terrain that was hostile enough to discourage organizational pursuit and steep enough to attenuate the signal and remote enough that the remoteness was itself a barrier.

More practically: I needed Wei to stop glowing.

"We're pushing harder today," I said. Morning. Camp broken. Packs on.

"Why?"

"Because the terrain requires it."

A half-truth. The terrain would accept any pace. The terrain was terrain — it didn't have requirements, only properties. But the properties were useful, and using them required speed, and speed required motivation, and motivation required information, and the information I was willing to share was "the terrain requires it" because "a sect dedicated to cosmic bureaucracy is triangulating your nocturnal qi-emissions" was in the category of truths whose delivery would produce more problems than the truth's absence.

We climbed. Hard. Five hours without rest. The trail — the actual trail, the one made by goats and gravity rather than sects and ideology — switched back and forth up a slope that was serious about its angle and unapologetic about its commitment to verticality.

Wei kept up. His body, whatever its instabilities, was robust. The qi-enhancement of his physical systems — musculature, respiration, endurance — was operating at a level that made the climb manageable where it should have been brutal. He wasn't breathing hard. Wasn't sweating proportionally. Was climbing a mountain the way normal people climbed stairs: with effort but without emergency.

The tremor was worse with exertion. His fingers: vibrating against the rock faces he used for handholds. I could hear it — the subtle percussion of fingertip against stone, the rhythm of a system that was fighting itself, the motor cortex sending one signal and the qi-system sending another and the resolution of the conflict expressed in the physical medium of involuntary movement.

He didn't mention it. Didn't slow down. Didn't adjust his technique to compensate. Simply climbed, tremor and all, the persistence of someone who had accepted the symptom as a feature of his operating system and who was too busy operating to dedicate attention to the feature.

Around midday, the symmetry stopped.

Not gradually — abruptly. One step: the rocks were graded, the trees were spaced, the ground showed the subtle qi-organization of Heaven's Order territory. The next step: randomness. Natural. Trees where the seeds had fallen. Rocks where the erosion had placed them. The wild, unmanaged, beautiful chaos of a world that hadn't been told what shape to take.

We had crossed out of their ordered territory. The altitude was sufficient — this high, this steep, the energy required to maintain landscape-scale qi-organization exceeded the return, and even the Heaven's Order calculated returns because they were, beneath the philosophy and the jade seals and the symmetry, an organization, and organizations calculated.

"Feel that?" Wei said.

"What?"

"The — looseness. Like the air isn't holding its breath anymore."

I felt it. The absence of imposed structure. The relaxation of a landscape that had been held in position and was now released, and the release was almost physical, almost audible, the sigh of a world resuming its natural expression.

"Heaven's Order," I said. Giving him this one. This piece. Because the piece was observable and withholding the observable was a different category of dishonesty than withholding the invisible, and the categories mattered, and mattering was the only defense I had against the accusation that all lies were equivalent.

"They're down there?"

"They were. Not anymore. We're above their operational range."

He processed. "Operational range. They... organize the landscape?"

"They believe disorder is the source of suffering. They correct it."

"By lining up rocks?"

"By lining up everything."

He looked back down the slope. At the organized world below and the disorganized world around us. "Sounds exhausting."

"It is."

"Do they know about me?"

The question. Direct. Specific. The question I'd been expecting since I'd increased our pace, since I'd pushed us harder, since the urgency in my decisions had become detectable to someone who had learned to read urgency the way he'd learned to read qi-signatures — through pattern recognition and the absence of alternative explanations.

"Possibly."

"My qi. The beacon thing."

"Your cultivation signature is distinctive."

"Distinctive enough to follow?"

"Distinctive enough to notice. Following requires resources they may not commit."

Half-answer. Quarter-answer. The fraction of truth that was geometrically precise about its reduction and whose reduction was calculated to provide exactly enough information to satisfy the question without providing enough to produce the next question, which was "How do we make it stop?" and whose answer was "We can't" and whose "can't" was the thing I was avoiding because "can't" was terminal and terminal was the shape in the dark that I was not looking at.

"So we stay high," he said.

"We stay high."

"For how long?"

"For however long it takes."

He nodded. The nod of acceptance — not enthusiasm, not agreement, but the practical acknowledgment of someone who had evaluated the situation and found the response reasonable and whose reasonableness was the adaptation and whose adaptation was the maturity and whose maturity was arriving at a rate that exceeded his chronological timeline and that was fueled by necessity and whose necessity was my creation.

We set camp high. Above the treeline. Among rocks and grass and the thin air that tasted of altitude and isolation and the particular flavor of safety that came from being somewhere that required effort to reach — the safety of inconvenience, the protection of inaccessibility.

The mountains sheltered us. Not actively — passively. Through the simple mechanism of being large and steep and indifferent, through the physics of being obstacles, through the geography of being there.

I sat with my back against a rock. Wei: four meters away. The fire: small, because fuel was scarce this high and scarcity was honest. The sky: enormous, because altitude removed the visual obstructions that lower elevations used to pretend the sky was smaller than it was.

Stars. More than usual. More than sea level allowed. The full inventory: thousands, millions, the count that defeated counting and that existed therefore as magnitude rather than number.

Wei looked up.

"Yun."

"What?"

"I glow at night. Don't I."

The sentence landed. Not as question — as statement. The declarative form of a discovery that had been made independently, through self-observation, through the data that his own body provided during the liminal minutes between waking and sleeping when consciousness was still recording but control was already releasing.

Three seconds of silence. Four. Five.

"Yes," I said.

He nodded. Once. Looked at the stars. Looked at his hands. Looked at me.

"Okay," he said.

And slept.
