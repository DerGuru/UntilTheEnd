# Chapter 51

The inn smelled like beer and regret.

Both scents were authentic — the beer was being consumed in quantities that suggested dedication rather than pleasure, and the regret was visible in the posture of every person in the room who had ended up here instead of somewhere better and who had stopped pretending that somewhere better existed.

We entered because Wei needed a bed and I needed information and both of these things could be acquired in the same building, which was a efficiency that I appreciated and an exposure that I didn't.

Small. Twenty seats. Wooden floor, stained with the archaeological record of every drink that had been spilled on it since the planks were laid. A counter, behind which stood a man whose face contained the specific combination of suspicion and hospitality that innkeepers develop after years of receiving strangers and learning that strangers are, on average, disappointing.

I named him. Pig Nose. The naming was automatic — the compulsive shorthand that reduced the complexity of human individuality to a single, manageable label. Pig Nose was not a judgment. It was a filing system.

"Two," I said. "And food."

Pig Nose assessed us. The assessment took three seconds — the standard evaluation of whether the humans requesting shelter were likely to pay, stay, and not set fire to anything. We passed. Barely.

He pointed to a table. We sat.

Wei ate.

Noodles. Thick, over-sauced, served in a bowl that had been washed recently enough to maintain legal standards and not recently enough to maintain aesthetic ones. Wei ate them with the concentrated attention of someone who hadn't had warm food in weeks and who was experiencing the reintroduction of warmth and sauce and the general concept of abundance with an intensity that bordered on spiritual.

His face was — relaxed. The muscles around his eyes, which had been carrying the permanent tension of alertness since the mountain, softened. His jaw, which had been set in the stubbornness-configuration that I tracked like a meteorologist tracks pressure systems, loosened. His shoulders dropped from their combat-ready elevation to something approaching human.

For a moment. One moment. He was thirteen.

Not a cultivator. Not an anomaly. Not a boy whose core was eating him alive on the fuel that the woman across the table was involuntarily providing. A boy. Eating noodles. In a noisy inn. With sauce on his chin.

I watched him be thirteen and the watching cost me something that I didn't have a budget for.

He was doing something else, too. Something I recognized because I recognized everything. He was suppressing his qi. Deliberately — compressing it inward, holding it in his core, reducing his external signature to the faintest possible level. The technique was crude — improvisational, self-taught, the kind of qi-management that a Foundation Establishment practitioner shouldn't have needed and that Wei had developed on his own because the need was his and the solution was his and the asking-me-for-help was no longer the reflex it had been.

The suppression cost him. His hands, under the table, trembled. Harder than usual — the containment of qi producing internal pressure that his motor control absorbed by vibrating at a frequency that was invisible above the table and obvious below it.

He hid his hands. Under the wood. Under the noodles. Under the normality that he was constructing with the careful deliberation of someone building a shelter from materials that weren't quite right but that would hold if nobody leaned on them.

Another boy sat down. Young — fourteen, fifteen, the age where confidence exceeded competence and the gap between them was a source of entertainment for everyone except the boy occupying it. Traveler's clothes. No qi — baseline human.

"These noodles are terrible," the boy said.

"They're WARM," Wei said.

"That's not the same thing."

"It is tonight."

They talked. About nothing. About noodles. About the rain. About the bard in the corner who was drunk enough to sing and not drunk enough to sing well, who occupied the precise middle ground of intoxication where ambition and ability diverged and the audience paid the price.

Wei laughed. A real one. The sound was — I didn't have a category for it. I had hundreds of categories. Thousands. I'd been cataloguing human sounds for four millennia. But the sound of a boy laughing — genuinely, unprotected, with the specific quality that laughter has when it's not performing but simply happening — sat outside the system. Uncategorized. Uncontainable.

I left the moment to him. Turned. Walked to the corner.

The cultivator-merchant was sitting where merchants sit — in the position of maximum visual access and minimum exposure, the strategic seating that people who traded in information adopted instinctively. Middle-aged. Thin. The particular thinness of someone who travelled light because light was easier and easier was survival.

I sat opposite him. Signaled Pig Nose. Rice wine appeared.

"What sects are moving north?" I asked. Direct. No preamble. The interaction-style that I used when every second of conversation was a second of exposure and exposure was a currency I was spending and wanted to stop spending.

The merchant evaluated. The evaluation was professional — calculating the value of the information against the value of the transaction, the merchant's calculus that reduced all human interaction to exchange rates.

"Iron Lotus has three teams in the field. Heaven's Order is quiet — restructuring, they say. And there's a hermit-master asking questions nobody can answer." He paused. "Questions about someone who stopped the sky."

I sipped the wine. It was adequate.

"Which routes are safe?"

"None." He smiled. The smile of a man who found the question entertaining. "But the western pass is least watched. Nobody goes there because nobody wants to — bad terrain, worse weather."

"What does silence cost?"

"More than rice wine."

I placed a coin on the table. Not generously — precisely. The exact amount that bought compliance without buying loyalty, the transactional sweet spot that kept the relationship clean and the obligations minimal.

He took the coin. Drank his wine. We exchanged nothing further.

I returned to the table. Wei was still talking to the boy — still being thirteen, still constructing the normal that he'd built from noodles and conversation and the suppression of everything that made him abnormal. His hands were still under the table. His qi was still compressed. His smile was still genuine and the genuineness was the thing I was most grateful for and most afraid of because genuine things were the ones that broke cleanest.

I sat. Ate nothing. Watched.

The bard sang badly. The room smelled like beer and regret.

I preferred the beer.
