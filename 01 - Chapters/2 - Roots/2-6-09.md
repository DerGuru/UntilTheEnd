# Chapter 59

The inn served breakfast. Rice, pickled vegetables, something that had once been egg and was now a philosophical proposition about the relationship between intent and outcome. Wei ate. I didn't. Xu Ran ate slowly, with the careful precision of someone who had been hungry recently enough that food was still a negotiation rather than a routine.

Three people at a table. Two meters of scarred wood between them. An appropriate metaphor, but I wasn't collecting metaphors this morning.

Wei's hands were steady. He'd done something to them — a technique, a suppression, something he'd figured out in the twenty minutes between the courtyard and the table. The tremor was there. I could see it in the micro-oscillations of his chopsticks, in the fourth-decimal vibration that normal eyes wouldn't catch. But the visible tremor — the one he'd shown Xu Ran — was gone. Dampened. Controlled.

The cost was in his shoulders. Rigid. Held in the particular configuration of muscles that were doing two jobs and complaining about neither because the occupant had decided that complaint was a luxury and luxury was for people whose hands didn't shake.

"How long since the break?" Wei asked. Conversational. As if discussing weather, or road conditions, or any of the mundane topics that normal travelers exchanged over normal breakfasts at normal inns.

"Eleven months," Xu Ran said. "Give or take."

"And before that, how long did they shake?"

"Two years."

Wei processed. I could see the calculations. Two years of tremor, then a break. He was on — what? A few weeks? A month? The math was simple. The implications weren't.

"Did you try to stop them?" Wei asked.

"Everything. Meditation. Channeling exercises. A healer in Dragon Harbor who said it was spiritual misalignment and charged me three spirit stones for a diagnosis that could have been purchased for free from anyone with functioning observation."

Wei almost smiled. Almost. The corner of his mouth moved the distance of interest without arriving at the destination of amusement.

"Did anything work?"

"Slowing down."

"What does that mean?"

"It means—" Xu Ran paused. Set his chopsticks on the table. Aligned them parallel, precise, the unconscious habit of someone trained in a system where alignment mattered. "It means doing less than you can. Deliberately. Consistently. The gap between capacity and execution — that's where the tremor lives. Close the gap and it stops."

"By doing less."

"By doing less."

Wei stared at him. The stare of someone who had been told that the cure for burning was to stop being on fire and who was evaluating the practical application of that advice when the fire was not optional and the stopping was not possible.

"What if you can't?" Wei said. Quiet. The question delivered at the volume of honesty — low, because truths don't need projection, because projection is for the things we want heard and truths are the things we need said and need and want have different acoustics.

Xu Ran looked at him. The look was — I've described it before, the stripped quality, the absence of armor. But this was different. This was recognition. The specific, terrible recognition of someone who was seeing their own history replayed in someone else and who couldn't interfere because history doesn't take direction and replays don't respond to commentary.

"Then it gets worse," he said. "And then it breaks."

Silence. The particular, dense silence of a courtyard table in a third-rate inn where two boys had arrived at a truth that one of them had lived and the other was living and that both of them recognized as inevitable with the particular clarity of people who understood inevitability not as a concept but as a schedule.

I should have said something. Should have intervened. Should have provided the adult perspective, the reassurance, the clinical analysis that would reframe the prognosis as possibility rather than prophecy.

I said nothing. Because the prognosis was accurate, and reframing it as possibility would have been a kindness that was also a lie, and I had sufficient experience with the second category to understand that its supply was not inexhaustible and that the moments where I drew from it should be chosen with more care than I had recently demonstrated.

Wei leaned back. Looked at the ceiling. The ceiling was unremarkable — beams, thatch, the architectural vocabulary of necessity. He looked at it anyway, because looking up was looking away and looking away was a decision about where to direct one's attention and some decisions were about avoidance and avoidance was sometimes wisdom and sometimes cowardice and the difference between them was often indistinguishable from the outside.

"Thanks," he said.

"For what?" Xu Ran asked.

"For not lying."

Three words. Aimed at Xu Ran. Delivered to me. The ballistic arc of a sentence that traveled through one person to hit another, whose trajectory was a statement about trust and its distribution and whose impact was in my sternum, which is not an organ that responds to language, except that it did, except that it had, except that three words from a thirteen-year-old boy could relocate something fundamental in a being that had existed for longer than his species and who should have been beyond relocation and was not.

Wei pushed his bowl aside. "We should leave today."

"Agreed," I said.

Xu Ran watched. Said nothing. His bowl was empty. His hands, which had been steady throughout — the hands of someone past the tremor, past the break, past the reconstruction — rested on the table. Still. The stillness of aftermath.

I envied those hands. The thought surfaced before I could prevent it. Not for their steadiness, which was the steadiness of loss, but for their honesty. They were what they were. No suppression, no dampening, no technique applied to hide the visible symptoms of an invisible condition. They had broken and healed and the healing was imperfect and the imperfection was visible and the visibility was — was—

I looked away.
