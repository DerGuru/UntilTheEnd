# Chapter 40

The inn was small, dirty, and perfect.

Perfect because it sat at a crossroads where three trails met and news traveled the way news travels in places where literacy is a luxury and memory is currency: through mouths, through repetition, through the accumulation and distortion of truth that transforms fact into legend with the efficiency of a machine that nobody built and nobody maintains but that has been running since the first human told the second human about the third.

I needed a legend.

Not for me — for the people looking for me. The scouts, the sects, the growing network of interested parties whose interest was academic in the short term and lethal in the long term and whose convergence on our position was a geometry problem that I could solve by changing the inputs.

Distance had failed. Distance compressed the stream and released it stronger. Suppression had failed. Suppression loaded the output and detonated it. The only variable I could control — the only lever available — was trajectory. Where they looked. Where they expected us to be. The art of being somewhere else by making them certain we were here.

The innkeeper was fat, talkative, and possessed the particular quality of indiscretion that I associated with people who traded information the way farmers traded grain: constantly, automatically, with no clear sense of the value differential between what they gave and what they received.

I approached the counter. Wei hung back — I'd suggested he wait outside, and for once he'd complied, either because the suggestion carried a tone that discouraged argument or because the inn smelled like fermented cabbage and even moral conviction has olfactory limits.

"Tea," I said.

The innkeeper poured. Brown, lukewarm, the kind of tea that existed in the space between beverage and insult.

"Traveling?"

"Passing through."

"From where?"

"East." A lie. We'd come from the north.

"Heading?"

"South." A lie. We were heading west.

He leaned in. The body language of someone entering a transaction that wasn't commercial. "Heard something interesting the other day. From a merchant — reliable man, been running the river route for years."

I waited. Let the silence work. Silence, in conversations with talkers, functions as a vacuum — it pulls words out of people with the inevitability of a physical law.

"He said there's a woman. Moving through the southern provinces. Unusual. Old — but not *looking* old. You know what I mean?"

I sipped the tea. It was as bad as expected.

"Cultivator?" I asked. The question was bait, threaded with the casual disinterest of someone who was curious but not invested.

"Must be. The things he described — " The innkeeper made a gesture. Vague. The universal sign for *powerful beyond my ability to categorize.* "Said she stopped a tribulation. With one hand."

"Stories grow."

"This one has legs."

I set the cup down. Turned, as though preparing to leave. Then paused — the deliberate hesitation, the performative afterthought that made the next words feel spontaneous rather than scripted.

"I've heard that story. Different version. They say she went south. Over the Jade Pass. Heading toward the coast."

The innkeeper's eyes widened. Not dramatically — the subtle dilation that indicates information acquisition, the pupils adjusting the way they adjust when a map reveals a new road.

"The coast? That's specific."

"Travelers talk."

"They do, they do."

I left. The performance cost me something — a weight, an ugliness, the particular self-loathing that attended the manipulation of information even when the manipulation served a purpose that justified it. Talking about myself — even as fiction, even as misdirection, even as a deliberately false legend planted in the mouth of a man who would repeat it to everyone who passed through his inn — required engaging with my own mythology, and engaging with my own mythology required acknowledging that I had one, and acknowledging that I had one required admitting that the woman in the story was me, and the admission was a door I kept locked for reasons that predated the lock.

I hated it. Every second. Every word.

Wei was outside. Sitting on a wall. His hands worked — the carving, the whittling, the rhythmic motion that concealed the tremor and produced the small wooden shapes that accumulated in his pack like a record of his body's inability to be still.

He looked up. "What'd you tell him?"

"Nothing. Eat."

I tossed him a rice cake — purchased from a cart at the crossroads, the kind of anonymous transaction that left no footprint and fed a boy and cost me something that the coin's denomination didn't represent.

He ate. Didn't push. The restraint was habitual now — the practiced acceptance of partial answers that had become his contribution to our dynamic. He asked. I deflected. He accepted. The cycle repeated with the reliability of a mechanism and the tragedy of an agreement that neither party had negotiated and both were honoring.

An hour later. The trail west. The crossroads behind us.

I stopped. Crouched. Looked at the ground.

A scar. In the rock. Not surface damage — deep, structural, the kind of mark that qi leaves when it's expelled violently from a system that can't contain it. The scar ran for about a meter, jagged, the trajectory of energy that had been released without direction or control.

I placed my palm on it. Read it.

Not with instruments. Not with technique. With the particular sensitivity that four thousand years of qi-exposure develops — the ability to feel the residual signature of energy that had passed through a medium and left its identity behind the way water leaves salt.

The signature was familiar. Adjacent to something I'd felt before — in the tribulation, in the sky-tearing event that had started all of this. Not identical. Related. The way a child's handwriting relates to a parent's — recognizable, derived, but younger. Less controlled. Damaged.

Xu Ran.

He'd been here. Weeks ago, based on the decay of the residual. He'd stood here, on this trail, and his core had — spasmed. Discharged. Lost control in a way that left a scar in solid rock and a signature that screamed instability and pain and the particular kind of suffering that comes from trying to be something you used to be and failing.

His core was cracked. This much I already knew from the merchant's story — the genius whose core broke, who wandered, who asked about a woman. But the scar told more. The crack wasn't healing. It was widening. His cultivation was degrading — the slow unraveling of a system that had been pushed past its limits by the tribulation and that was now falling apart with the gradual inevitability of a structure whose foundation has been compromised.

He was looking for me. This, too, I knew. But the scar added urgency — he was looking for me and he was running out of time.

I stood. Erased the scar — a flick of qi, gentle, the smallest possible application of force, enough to smooth the rock and dissolve the residual and eliminate the evidence that would have told anyone else what I'd just read. Not for Xu Ran's sake. For ours. His trail and our trail crossing the same geography created an intersection that interested parties could use, and I had just planted a false legend that pointed south and I didn't need a real trail pointing west.

Wei hadn't noticed. He was ahead, walking, his back to me, his pack moving with the rhythm of his stride.

I followed. The scar was gone. The information stayed.

---

Night. Camp. Fire. The routine that was ritual.

Wei carved. The object in his hands was taking shape — recognizable now. A bird. Small, abstract, the simplified form of something that flew and that he was translating from memory into wood with hands that shook rhythmically and consistently and that he worked through with the stubbornness that was his secondary cultivation art.

I watched his hands. The tremor. The carving.

The stream: flowing. Full. Constant.

She chose. In that moment. Not the dramatic choice — not the decision to leave, to separate, to put a thousand meters between them and accept the consequences. Not that. The smaller choice. The daily one. The one that was also the larger one, repeated:

*Stay.*

Because the alternative — leaving him — was a calculation she'd run and a result she'd rejected and a door she'd closed and a wall she'd built and the wall faced outward, toward the world that might take him, and not inward, toward the thing that was actually destroying him, which was her.

The fire burned. Wei carved. His hands shook. The bird took shape.

I sat across from him and watched the stream flow from my body to his with the quiet constancy of something that could not be stopped and that I chose, again, tonight, to not stop trying to stop.

Because trying was the lie that made staying possible. And staying was the truth I couldn't afford to examine.

The bird had wings. Small. Imperfect. Enough.
