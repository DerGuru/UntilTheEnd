# Chapter 36

I waited until he slept.

Then I tried again.

Not for hope — hope was a resource I'd depleted on the river when I'd seen the stream and understood what it was and what it meant and what it was doing to the boy sleeping four meters from me. I tried because trying was the only alternative to accepting, and accepting was — not available. Not yet. Not while there was a variable I hadn't tested or a method I hadn't attempted or a fraction of my capability that I hadn't deployed against the problem of being my own disaster.

Meditation. The deep kind — the full-immersion inward focus that I hadn't used in decades because the level of concentration it demanded was the level that left the physical world unmonitored and leaving the physical world unmonitored was a luxury I'd stopped affording when I'd acquired something worth protecting.

But Wei was asleep. The ambient field was clear. The scouts were behind us — two days, minimum. The night was quiet and the threats were distant and the window was as wide as it was going to get.

I closed my eyes. Pulled inward.

My qi-system was — vast. This was not vanity. It was architecture. Four thousand years of cultivation had built an internal landscape that exceeded the metaphors available to describe it. Oceans. Continents. Galaxies. All of these were insufficient and all of them were used by those rare individuals who had glimpsed the edges of what I contained and tried to give it shape in language that was never designed to hold shapes that large.

I went deep. Past the surface flows. Past the middle channels. Past the secondary meridians and the tertiary networks and the auxiliary systems that I'd built and refined and abandoned and rebuilt across millennia of practice. Down to the core. The place where my qi originated — not produced, originated, the source-point from which everything else radiated.

The core was still. It had always been still. The stillness of something so dense that motion was unnecessary — the way a mountain doesn't need to move because its presence is already everywhere that matters.

I focused on the output. The flow that left my system. The stream.

There. Visible from the inside — a thread of energy, thin as spider silk and dense as bedrock, extending from my core through my channels through my skin through the air between my body and his body into his channels into his core. A conduit. Permanent. Established.

Not new.

The realization landed with a weight that was physical. Not new. The thread wasn't new. It was worn — smooth, embedded, the way a rope wears into the stone it rests against. This stream had been flowing for — how long? Months? Since the mountain? Since the village?

I traced it backward. Through the layers. Through the timeline that my qi-system recorded the way stone records pressure — in strata, in compression, in the physical history of forces applied over time.

Months. Since the first week at Lianshan. Since the first night he'd slept within range of my field. Since before I'd known his name.

The stream had been flowing since Wei was twelve. Since a boy had sat down next to a woman on a porch and refused to leave.

I held the thread. Mentally. Gripped it with the focused intention of four thousand years of qi-mastery — the deepest, most refined, most absolute control I could bring to bear on my own internal system.

I pulled.

The thread yielded. Slowly. Like pulling a root from soil that has grown around it — possible, but resistant, and the resistance was not the thread's but my own system's. My qi didn't want to let go. Not "want" in the conscious sense — in the physical sense. The way a river doesn't want to flow uphill. The way a heart doesn't want to stop beating. The thread was part of me now. Part of how I operated. Removing it wasn't suppression. It was amputation.

First breath. I pulled. The thread thinned. The flow to Wei's core diminished — I could feel it, could feel the reduction like a valve closing, like a door narrowing.

Second breath. Pulled harder. The thread thinned further. My channels protested — a deep ache, the kind that exists below pain in the taxonomy of sensation, the discomfort of a system being asked to function against its own design.

Third breath. Sweat. On my forehead. On my palms. On the backs of my hands — places that hadn't produced moisture since before the current dynasty's great-grandfather was born. Sweat. The body's admission that what the mind was attempting exceeded the parameters for which the body was calibrated.

Fourth breath. The thread was gossamer now. Almost nothing. The flow to Wei's core was negligible — background noise, ambient residual, functionally zero. His core vibrated — uncertain, like a wheel that had been spinning and was decelerating and didn't know what to do at rest.

I held. One more breath. One more second. One more—

Fifth breath.

The thread snapped back.

Not gradually. Not leaking. BACK. The full width, the full density, the full flow — and more. The suppression had loaded it. Pressurized it. Compressed all the energy I'd been holding back into a concentrated burst that hit Wei's system like a wave hitting a shore.

He flinched. In his sleep. His back arched — a single, involuntary spasm. His channels flared, absorbing the burst with the desperate efficiency of open vessels receiving flood. His core blazed — bright enough that I could see it through his clothing, through the blanket, through the four meters of dark air between us.

Then it settled. His body relaxed. His breathing resumed. The core dimmed to its normal low glow and his channels redistributed the excess and his system balanced and he slept on, undisturbed, unaware that his teacher had just failed to save him and the failure had made the problem worse.

I opened my eyes.

My hands were shaking. Actually shaking. Not the phantom tremor of emotional distress — the physical vibration of muscles that had been under tension and released and hadn't recovered the baseline that four thousand years of mastery was supposed to guarantee.

I looked at them. At my hands. At the tremor. At the proof that this — this boy, this stream, this impossible situation — had reached something that nothing else in four millennia had reached.

"Es geht nicht."

Three words. The same ones. The same language. The admission that the most powerful entity in the world could not prevent her own qi from feeding a thirteen-year-old boy whose core would break because of it.

*It doesn't work.*

I put my hands in my lap. Waited for the shaking to stop. It took longer than it should have.

The night continued. The dark held. The stream flowed. And somewhere between the tremor in my hands and the glow in his chest, the word *autonomous* surfaced again — the feeling that the qi had a direction I hadn't given it and a purpose I hadn't assigned and a will that was not mine.

I buried the word. The way I buried everything.

It didn't stay buried. Nothing ever did.
