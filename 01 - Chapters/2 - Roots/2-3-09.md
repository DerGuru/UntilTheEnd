# Chapter 29

The forest gave us three days.

Dense canopy. Tall conifers that had never been logged because nothing up here was worth the labor cost — too steep, too remote, the kind of terrain that civilizations skipped over and economies forgot. The trails were animal-made. The streams were clean. The air had the thin quality of altitude, stripped of the humidity and human odor that lowland air carried like sediment.

Wei trained. The new pattern — slow, deliberate, the Qi-steps-in-sand protocol that replaced power cultivation with control cultivation. He didn't like it. This was obvious in the way that Wei's displeasure was always obvious: not in complaint but in the particular quality of his silence. The aggressive silence. The one that occupied space and made noise through the precision of its absence.

He drew patterns in the frozen ground. Qi-lines, barely visible, the faintest possible output — the opposite of everything his body wanted to do. His core hummed with suppressed potential. His channels were oversaturated, pressurized, the cultivation equivalent of a river behind a dam that nobody had built and nobody could reinforce and that existed only because the boy generating the pressure was also the boy containing it through sheer stubbornness.

"Again," I said.

He redrew. Slower. The line wobbled — not from weakness but from excess. Too much qi trying to fit through a channel calibrated for too little. Like writing with a brush the size of a tree.

"The left line drifts."

"I know."

"Then fix it."

"I'm *trying*."

He was. That was the problem. The trying was the pressure. The intention was the force. The harder he concentrated, the more qi his core supplied, and the more qi his core supplied, the less control he had over the output, and the less control he had, the harder he concentrated. A loop. The kind that doesn't resolve through effort because effort is the fuel.

I didn't tell him this. Understanding the trap doesn't spring it.

"Stop."

He stopped. Shoulders rigid. Jaw set. The posture of someone who was fourteen months into learning that the world ran on rules that punished competence and who hadn't yet decided whether to be angry about it or to simply adjust. He stood between the two positions the way a coin stands on its edge — stable only if nothing breathes.

"Eat," I said.

"I'm not hungry."

"Eat anyway."

He ate. Cold rice, dried meat, the portions getting smaller not because we were rationing but because his appetite was declining and I'd stopped fighting about it because some battles are won by not fighting them and some are lost the same way and the difference between the two is only visible from afterward.

The afternoon went to walking. Northeast still, deeper into terrain that didn't appear on any map I'd seen — and I'd seen most of them. The forest thickened. The trees grew older. The light took on the filtered quality of places that had been shaded for centuries, dim and green and faintly ecclesiastical, like the inside of a building whose architect had been a species other than human.

Wei walked ahead. He'd started doing this in the last week — moving to the front of our two-person formation, choosing the path, making the decisions about direction with the quiet assertion of someone who was beginning to believe that decisions were his to make. I let him. The path was safe. His choices were reasonable. And the practice of choosing — the experience of selecting and committing and bearing the consequence — was a curriculum I couldn't teach by doing it for him.

He turned. "How far to the next town?"

"Two days. Maybe three."

"We need salt."

"I know."

"And needle and thread. My pack's coming apart."

"I know."

He turned back. Walked. The list of things he knew we needed and I knew we needed and neither of us needed to discuss but he discussed anyway because the act of naming necessities was his way of participating in the logistics that kept us alive and the participation made him feel less carried and more present and I wasn't going to take that from him.

Night.

I sat watch. Not from necessity — nothing in this forest could threaten me, and the scouts were behind us by now, their search radius exceeded by our pace. I sat watch because the alternative was lying down and lying down invited thinking and thinking invited the number.

Forty-seven.

It was still there. Hadn't faded. Hadn't softened at the edges the way memories do, the way even vivid experiences blur and fragment and eventually reduce to impressions rather than specifics. The number remained precise. Clinical. The kind of certainty that doesn't belong to human cognition because human cognition deals in probability and approximation and the comfortable imprecision of "probably" and "likely" and "around."

Forty-seven was none of those things. It was exact. And its exactness was the part that frightened me — not the number itself, not the prediction, not even the implication that Wei's core would fracture. Those were problems. Problems had solutions. What frightened me was the *quality* of the knowledge. The texture. The way it sat in my mind like a foreign object — present, undeniable, and obviously placed there by something other than my own cognition.

I'd had thoughts I couldn't explain before. Moments of knowledge without source. But they'd been vague — a direction to avoid, a person to distrust, a timing that felt wrong without clear reason. Instinct. The word I used when explanation failed.

This wasn't instinct. Instinct didn't come with decimal points.

Wei shifted in his sleep. His core pulsed — once, hard, the kind of pulse that in a healthy cultivator would indicate a minor cycle adjustment and in Wei indicated the same thing a tremor indicates in a mountain: that the forces underneath were larger than the surface suggested and more active than the stillness implied.

I extended my hand. Not touching — hovering, the way you hold your palm over a candle to test the heat. His qi-field pressed against my skin. Warm. Alive. Dense with the particular vitality that young cultivators radiated and that I had felt ten thousand times and that in Wei was different because it was *too much* and growing and not slowing.

I pulled back. Stood. Walked to the edge of the clearing. Looked up.

Stars. The same ones as always. The same configurations that had been there four thousand years ago and that would be there four thousand years from now, unchanged and unchangeable and indifferent. Stars didn't care about numbers. Stars didn't care about boys.

Stars were useful that way.

I stayed at the edge until dawn. Watching nothing. Thinking nothing I was willing to claim. And when the light came and Wei woke and asked "Where next?" I said "Northeast" and didn't explain and he didn't ask.

The forest gave us a direction. I took it. Not because I knew where it led, but because motion was preferable to sitting with a number that refused to leave and a question I refused to answer.
