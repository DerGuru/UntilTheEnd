# Chapter 43

Morning.

The kind of morning that existed before language — before someone named it dawn, before the categories of light and dark became concepts, before the word morning was invented to domesticate the raw, uncivilized fact of the world becoming visible again. The light was grey-gold. The mist was low, sitting in the valley like something spilled. The air smelled like dew and pine and the particular mineral coldness of ground that had been dark for eight hours and was only now remembering warmth.

I was barefoot.

Not by intention — I had gotten up, left the camp, walked to the edge of the clearing, and realized only then that my feet were bare. The grass was wet. The dew between my toes was cold — actually cold, the sharpened, genuine cold that the breach had returned to me and that still surprised me with its presence, the way a guest who has been away for years surprises you by knowing where the cups are.

I stood in the grass and the dew was cold between my toes and the morning was happening and I was in it.

The fox-spirit was awake. Sitting at the tree line, facing the valley, its posture the alert stillness of an animal monitoring something it could sense but I could not. The amber eyes caught the early light and held it. The tail was wrapped tight around its paws — the compact, self-contained arrangement of an animal that was finished with sleep and had begun its day's assessment.

Xu Ran was asleep. Or performing sleep — the careful, measured breathing that could have been genuine rest or the deliberate facsimile of a man who wanted to give me privacy in the morning. I hadn't decided which. It didn't matter. His sleeping form was a shape in the camp behind me, indistinct in the mist, human-sized, breathing.

I pressed my feet into the grass.

The sensation was — exact. Individual. Each blade a separate pressure, each drop of dew a distinct temperature, the soil beneath giving slightly with the weight, the whole foot a sensor array receiving data that had nothing to do with immortality or mortality or the cosmic architecture of belief and reality. It was a foot in grass. Wet. Cold. Present.

How do you let go of something you've held for millennia?

The question was there. Had been there since the river, since the sash, since the open hands and the water through the fingers and the crystallization of the insight that was both perfectly clear and perfectly impossible. Not becoming mortal — stopping the holding of immortality. Not gripping — opening. Not willing — releasing. She understood the mechanism. She understood the theory. She understood the shape of it the way you understand the shape of a mountain from a distance — visible, mapped, dimensionally apprehended.

But understanding the shape of a mountain is not the same as climbing it.

How do you open a fist that has been closed so long it has forgotten it's a fist? How do you release a grip that has become the structure of the hand? How do you let go of the thing that is doing the letting? The paradox was not philosophical. It was practical. It was the, bodily, daily problem of a woman standing in wet grass who knew exactly what she needed to do and had no idea how to do it.

This was the mountain's question.

I didn't know that yet — not explicitly, not in the narrative-aware way that I'm framing it now from this side of the telling. But I knew the question's shape. I knew its weight. I knew that it would not be answered by thinking, or by will, or by another dramatic confrontation or revelation or twist. It would be answered — if it could be answered — by the same slow, physical, bodily process that had brought the insight in the first place. By hands in water. By feet in grass. By the daily, mundane, unremarkable practice of being a thing in the world without gripping the world into shape.

The mist was lifting. The grey-gold becoming gold. The fox-spirit turned its head and looked at me with the amber evaluation that I had stopped trying to interpret and had started accepting as its own sufficient communication.

"Breakfast," I said.

To no one. To the morning. To the fox-spirit, which didn't care. To myself, which was — for the first time in a very long time — one self, speaking with one voice, hearing clearly.

I turned from the clearing. Walked back to the camp. The dew on my feet picked up debris — pine needles, a fragment of leaf, the small accumulations of walking barefoot on forest floor. The fire from last night was embers. I crouched. Added kindling. Blew. The, practiced breath — not too hard, not too soft, the breath that feeding a fire required, the same breath that Wei had taught me long ago without calling it teaching.

The fire caught.

I put the pot on. Water from the skin. Rice from the bag. The measurements were imprecise — a handful, a splash, the calibration of someone who had been cooking rice long enough that the body knew the ratios without consulting the mind. The water warmed. The rice sat in the warming water, doing whatever rice does in the minutes before cooking begins — absorbing, softening, preparing.

Xu Ran stirred. Opened his eyes. The transition from sleep — or from performed sleep — to waking was, as always, immediate. No grogginess, no slow emergence. He was awake, fully, in a single blink, the way a man wakes who has trained himself to surface quickly.

"Rice," I said.

He sat up. Looked at me. At the fire. At the pot. The morning assessment — the quick, comprehensive evaluation of status, environment, companion. Everything accounted for. Everything acceptable.

"Good," he said.

I cooked the rice. Watched it. Stirred with the stick I'd been using as a stirrer for weeks, the one with the slight curve at the end that made it exactly right for the pot's curvature. The rice cooked the way rice cooked — slowly, inevitably, without requiring my belief or my will or my conviction. The heat did the work. The water did the work. I held the stick and stirred and watched.

The rice was done. I served two bowls. Set one near the fire for him. Held mine.

I ate.

The rice was adequate — not burned this time, not perfect either, the adequacy of rice cooked by a competent but uninspired chef. Each bite was a bite. Each swallow was a swallow. I didn't need to eat. The body that ran on conviction rather than biology didn't require fuel, didn't metabolize, didn't extract nutrients from starch and convert them to energy through the patient chemistry of digestion.

I ate because I wanted to.

Not needed. Wanted. The distinction — which had been invisible for eons, which had been buried beneath the weight of immortality where want and need were both irrelevant because the body sustained itself through belief — the distinction was there now, clear, the way the Gedanken-Echos were clear, the way the monologue was whole. I wanted the rice. I wanted the warmth. I wanted the morning and the fire and the taste and the act of eating with another person while the fox-spirit watched and the mist lifted and the world continued its patient, unrequested operation.

Wanting was a beginning.

Not the answer — the question was still there, the how of letting go, the shape of the mountain from the base. But wanting was a beginning because wanting was different from gripping. Wanting was the open hand, the palm that held without clutching, the fingers that touched without closing. You could want something and let it go. You could want rice and eat rice and finish rice and set the bowl down and the wanting was complete and the letting go was natural and the two were not enemies.

I set the bowl down. 

Dew on my feet. Rice in my bowl. The question that would burn until the end, and the morning, and the fire, and the man who was eating his rice in silence, and the fox-spirit that was watching us both with amber eyes that held the early light like something precious.

I wanted to be here.

I was.
