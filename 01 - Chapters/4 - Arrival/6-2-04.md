# Chapter 12

The herbs smelled wrong.

Xu Ran was cooking — the evening ritual, the human ceremony of preparing food over fire, the domestic anchor that kept us tethered to the ordinary. He had a method: the pot first, the water second, the rice third, the herbs last. Always last. The herbs went in at the end because that was when they released the most flavor, and flavor mattered to Xu Ran the way accuracy mattered to his maps — not as luxury but as principle.

The herbs were mountain herbs. Wild rosemary. A bitter root I didn't know the name of. Something sharp and green that grew where the altitude thinned the air. He mixed them with the confidence of a man who had learned to cook from necessity and had converted necessity into competence.

But the proportions were wrong.

Too much of the sharp one. Too little of the bitter. The ratio was — familiar. Not from Xu Ran's cooking, not from any meal I'd eaten in the last several months. From before. From a kitchen that wasn't a kitchen, from a fire that wasn't this fire, from a boy who couldn't cook but cooked anyway because stubbornness was his primary relationship to the world.

Wei.

The memory arrived like the creation images — not breaking through, not forcing past the wall, but arriving. Present. Complete. The wall didn't intervene. The wall had been quiet all day — since the village, since the warping, since the conscious editing that should have triggered every defensive mechanism it possessed and had triggered none.

The memory was clear.

Not the earlier fragments — those had been splinters, shards, pieces of something broken that I'd had to reassemble. This was whole. Intact. A continuous, coherent sequence of moments, preserved with the painful, absolute clarity of something that had been stored at high resolution and was now being played back at full fidelity.

I stopped eating.

The herbs' smell filled the clearing — wrong in the way they were wrong, right in the way they were right, the paradox of a scent that belonged to two different times and neither of them was now.

Wei.

The forest had been different. Denser. Southern. The kind of forest where the canopy closed completely and the light that reached the ground was green and filtered and heavy with moisture. I'd been walking — I was always walking, the eternal transit, the perpetual motion of someone who had nowhere to be and all of time to not be there. The walking was old. Centuries old. The forest was one of thousands, and the trail was one of millions, and I was passing through it the way light passes through glass — present, transient, leaving nothing.

He was sitting on a rock.

Small. Dirty. A child — eight, maybe nine, the age where humans are large enough to be independent and small enough to be vulnerable and stubborn enough to be both at once. His clothes were torn. His hair was a catastrophe — matted, twigs-embedded, the hair of someone who considered grooming an adversarial concept. His hands were in the dirt, doing something purposeful — digging, probably, or arranging stones, or whatever it was that children did when left unsupervised in a forest.

I almost walked past him.

That was the detail that the memory emphasized — the *almost*. The fraction of a second between seeing and not-seeing, between noticing and ignoring, between the reflex of continued walking and the decision to stop. I had spent centuries not-stopping. Not-seeing. Not-noticing. The wall made it easy — the erasure took care of the things that might have made me pause, the guardian removed the hooks that might have caught my attention. I walked. I passed. I forgot.

I almost walked past him.

I stopped.

The stopping was the choice. Not a grand choice, not a dramatic choice, not the kind of choice that announces itself with orchestral accompaniment and dramatic lighting. A small choice. The smallest possible unit of decision: I saw a child, and instead of walking, I stopped.

He looked up.

His face was — I remembered every line. The jaw set in the permanent defiance of a child who had been told *no* so many times that *no* had become his operating assumptions. The eyes — dark, sharp, too intelligent for his face, the eyes of a boy who saw everything and forgave nothing. The smear of dirt across his left cheek. The scratch on his right hand, half-healed, evidence of a fight with something that had probably been inanimate.

He looked up at me, and his mouth opened, and the first thing he said was: "You're standing in my light."

Not *who are you*. Not *what do you want*. Not any of the questions that a child alone in a forest should ask a stranger. *You're standing in my light*. As if I were the intrusion. As if the forest belonged to him and I was the trespasser and the relevant issue was not my identity or my intentions but the shadow I was casting on whatever he was doing in the dirt.

I should have walked on. The wall should have intervened — should have smoothed the hook, blunted the attention, redirected the interest toward the trail and the walking and the centuries of transit that were my assigned pattern. The wall should have made me forget him before I'd finished looking at him.

It didn't.

Because the choice had been mine. Not the wall's. Not the guardian's. Not any of the mechanisms that managed my experience and curated my memory and decided what I was allowed to care about. Mine. I chose to stop. I chose to look. I chose to see a dirty, stubborn child sitting on a rock in a forest and I chose — for the first time in millennia — to be interested.

That was the word. Not love. Not compassion. Not the sentimental vocabulary that stories use to describe the first meeting of souls who are destined to matter to each other. Interest. Pure, undecorated interest. The simple, radical act of paying attention.

I stepped out of his light.

He went back to his digging. Didn't thank me. Didn't acknowledge the courtesy. Simply returned to whatever urgent business occupied him in the dirt, as if I had been a minor atmospheric disturbance that had resolved itself and required no further attention.

I sat down.

Not close — four meters away. On a rock of my own. The sitting was as unreasonable as the stopping, as inexplicable as the looking, as unprecedented as the interest. I had no reason to sit. I had nowhere to sit toward. I had centuries of walking ahead of me — or behind me, or around me, the temporal geometry of an immortal life made all directions equivalent.

I sat and I watched a child dig in the dirt.

"You're still here," he said, without looking up.

"Yes."

"Why?"

I didn't answer. I didn't have an answer. The truth — *because I chose to look at you and the looking won't let go* — was not something I could articulate to a child or to myself or to the wall that was watching and waiting and not intervening.

He shrugged. The shrug of someone who had cataloged me as a minor mystery and filed me under *unimportant*. He went back to his digging. His small fists worked the earth with the absolute commitment of someone who believed that what he was doing mattered.

His hands smelled like herbs. The wrong ones. Too much of the sharp. Too little of the bitter.

"You stopped eating," Xu Ran said.

I blinked. The clearing. The fire. The pot of rice and herbs. Evening. Now.

I looked at my plate. The herbs smelled wrong. Smelled right. Both.

"The herbs," I said.

"What about them?"

"He mixed them the same way."

Xu Ran didn't ask who. He knew. He always knew — the subject of my absences, the destination of my departures, the name that lived in the space between what I said and what I didn't say.

He poured more rice into my bowl. The gesture was practical, domestic, deliberately ordinary. A man maintaining the rituals that maintained the world.

"Eat," he said.

I ate. The herbs tasted wrong. Tasted right.

Tasted like a choice I'd made in a forest, a lifetime ago, when I'd stepped out of a child's light and sat down and for the first time in millennia decided to see.
