# Chapter 14

The analogy arrived the next morning, walking.

How do you unlearn swimming?

You can't. Not actively. Not by deciding to forget the coordination of arms and legs and breath that the body has encoded into its motor pathways. You can't sit on a shore and will yourself into forgetting buoyancy, can't concentrate your way out of the muscle patterns that keep you afloat. Swimming, once learned, lives in the body like language lives in the throat — too deep for conscious access, too integrated for surgical removal.

But you can stop practicing.

Stop getting in the water. Stop moving your arms in the remembered patterns. Stop reinforcing the pathways with repetition. And eventually — not soon, not cleanly, but eventually — the body begins to forget. Not completely. Not the way you forget a fact or a face. The swimming remains as potential, as dormant capability, as the ghost of a pattern that no longer runs because the conditions that triggered it no longer exist.

Millennia of practice.

That was the scale. Not years of swimming lessons. Not a childhood of summers at a lake. Millennia — eons — of reinforced conviction, every day a practice session, every survival a repetition, every moment of continued immortality another stroke in the water. My body had been swimming for so long that the swimming was the body, the pattern was the structure, the muscle memory was the muscle itself.

How do you forget something your body has been doing since before memory began?

"A brick at a time," Xu Ran said.

Morning. Fire — he'd already lit it, the early-riser's contribution to a partnership whose other half did not require sleep but pretended to because pretending maintained the rhythm of human coexistence. Rice from the foraged supply — he'd found wild grains two days ago, enough for perhaps a week if rationed, supplemented with the bitter greens that mountain terrain offered to those willing to eat them.

"The hesitation," he continued. "Yesterday. 'My finger could bleed.' That was a brick."

"A crack in a brick."

"A crack is a start."

He was doing the thing — the pragmatic dissection, the scholar's approach to immortal despair. Breaking the unbearable into its components. Reducing the existential to the operational. His talent: making the impossible feel like a task list.

"Not 'I am mortal,'" he said. "That's the building. Start with: 'This finger could bleed.' Then: 'This hand could hurt.' Then: 'This body could tire.' Each one a brick. Each brick a claim against the certainty. You don't demolish — you erode."

"That could take—"

"How long did building the conviction take?"

I didn't answer. The answer was: the entire duration of existence. The building had taken everything. Every moment. The conviction wasn't a thing she had built at some point — it was the accumulation of every moment of being alive. Layers upon layers. Stone upon stone. To erode that — even brick by brick — was the work of a lifetime that had no defined length.

"I know," he said. Reading the calculation on my face. "It's impossible. On any reasonable timeline."

"Then—"

"Reasonable timelines are for reasonable people." The micro-expression. The almost-smile. The flash of something that might have been warmth in a face that was calibrated for measurement. "You're not reasonable."

I looked at my hands. The hands that could make leaves float and water rise and flowers bloom. The hands that could reshape every physical law the universe had established. The hands that could change everything except themselves.

"Scheint eine Eins-zu-Eins-Sache zu sein," he had said when he tried to move a stone himself. Seems to be a one-to-one thing. No stone had moved. His hands had pressed and pushed and the stone had disregarded him with the indifference of a universe that responded to conviction, not effort. And he — he who could not move a pebble — was telling her how to unmake her own immortality.

"Maybe you're too close," he said.

"To what?"

"To yourself. You're trying to use your own tool on your own tool. The eye can't see itself."

The eye can't see itself. One needs a mirror. But these last months had been mirrors — the season of mirrors, the time when every reflective surface had shown her something true. She had looked in the mirror. She had seen herself. She knew the face.

But seeing the face was not changing the face.

"What would be a mirror?" I asked.

He shrugged. The shrug of a man who had pushed his logic to its boundary and reached the place where logic surrendered to intuition, where the scholar's framework gave way to the unmapped territory that only the subject could navigate.

"Something you can see yourself in. Something that shows you what you look like from outside. Something that isn't you — but reflects you."

He picked up his brush. Wrote something. I didn't ask what. His notebook was his mirror — the place where he saw himself reflected in the act of documenting another. Whatever he wrote was between him and the paper.

I sat with the question. What mirror could show an immortal what mortality looked like? What surface could reflect a face that had been unchanged for eons and show it — changed?

The fox-spirit approached. Sat near my knee. The amber eyes looked up at me with the, unreadable attention of an animal that had no stakes in human problems but was willing to sit near them.

I looked into its eyes.

Amber. Clear. The reflection of my face — small, inverted, contained in two copper discs. My face, as seen by a fox, as seen in a fox's eyes.

No answer came. The mirror reflected faithfully: she was who she was. The face was unchanged. The conviction was unbroken.

But the question was better now. Not what must I do. But what must I see.
