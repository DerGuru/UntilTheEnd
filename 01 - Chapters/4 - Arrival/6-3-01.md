# Chapter 16

"I've been thinking," Xu Ran said.

"You said that yesterday."

"I've been thinking more."

He'd set up a clearing. Three stones — small, medium, palm-sized — arranged in a line on the packed earth. The arrangement was deliberate, precise, each stone spaced one arm's length from the next. The laboratory of a man whose laboratory was the world.

"Tests," he said.

I looked at the stones. Then at him. Then at the stones again.

"You want me to move stones."

"I want you to try to move stones. There's a difference."

The dry precision. The careful distinction between attempting and accomplishing, between the experiment and the outcome, between the hypothesis and the data. He was in research mode — the mode that had produced notebooks full of careful observations and logical deductions and conclusions that had, despite every obstacle, turned out to be correct.

"First," he said. He pointed at the smallest stone. "Will it to move."

I stood. Looked at the stone. It was ordinary — grey, rough, the size of a child's fist. The kind of stone that existed in millions across these mountains, each one indistinguishable from the rest. I looked at it and I tried to will it to move.

Concentration. Focus. The gathering of intention toward a single point — the stone, its location, the desired change in its location. I willed. I wanted. I pushed with the invisible musculature of desire, the force that cultivation taught you to cultivate and direct and deploy.

Nothing.

The stone sat. Still. Silent. The supreme indifference of matter to consciousness, the fundamental non-responsiveness of the physical world to the wishes of the minds that inhabit it.

I tried harder. More will. More focus. More of the mental force that should have been sufficient — that would have been sufficient if the mechanism were will-based, effort-based, force-based.

Nothing.

"Maybe louder?" Xu Ran said. One eyebrow raised.

"It's not a qi attack."

"I know. Try the other way."

The other way. The way it had worked in the village, with the thirty cultivators. Not willing. Not wanting. Not pushing. Believing.

I breathed out.

The breathing was important — not as technique but as transition. The exhale was the release, the letting go of the framework that said *I want this to change*. The exhale emptied the wanting. What remained was — space. Clean space. The space where belief lived, the space where conviction operated, the space that was not about effort but about certainty.

I looked at the stone. Then I looked at a point two meters away — a patch of bare earth, slightly lower than the stone's current position.

I didn't want the stone to be there.

I believed the stone WAS there.

The shift was internal — a reorientation so fundamental that it felt like turning the whole world rather than moving a single stone. Not *the stone should be there* but *the stone IS there*. Not future tense, not conditional, not aspirational. Present tense. Indicative. Factual.

I blinked.

The stone was there.

Two meters from its original position. Sitting on the bare earth with the settled certainty of a stone that had been sitting on that particular patch of earth for a very long time. The earth around its base was undisturbed. The moss on its underside — moss I hadn't seen before, moss that hadn't been there before — was established, old, the kind of moss that takes years to grow in the specific pattern of green and brown that covered the stone's lower surface.

The stone hadn't moved. The stone had BEEN there. Always. The moss confirmed it. The earth confirmed it. The physical evidence, the empirical data, the observable reality — all of it confirmed that the stone's position was original, permanent, unaltered.

Xu Ran walked to the stone.

Slowly. The walk of a man approaching evidence he'd hypothesized but hadn't expected to encounter this directly. He knelt. Lifted the stone. Turned it. His fingers found the moss — touched it, felt its texture, verified its reality with the tactile certainty that his eyes couldn't provide alone.

"The — it was always —" He stopped. Shook his head. The headshake was not denial — it was a physical expression of a mind encountering a contradiction it couldn't resolve. He remembered the stone's original position. He also saw the moss, the undisturbed earth, the evidence of permanence. Both were true. Both couldn't be true.

He set the stone down. Stood. Looked at me.

"Now me," he said.

He positioned himself in front of the second stone. Faced it with the same concentration I'd used. Breathed in. Breathed out. Applied the lesson — not willing, believing.

"The stone IS there," he said. Pointing to a spot one meter away. His voice carried conviction. His face carried conviction. His body language carried everything that belief should carry — certainty, commitment, the full weight of a mind declaring something to be true.

Nothing happened.

The stone sat. Motionless. Indifferent to his belief as it had been to my will. The universe receiving his declaration and filing it under *interesting but irrelevant*.

He tried again. More belief. More conviction. The kind of certainty that a man with his methodology was capable of — genuine, supported, evidence-based.

Nothing.

He stared at the stone. Then at me. Then at the stone.

"The universe," he said, "does not care about my opinion."

The sentence was perfect — the specific, dry, precisely-calibrated humor of a man acknowledging a cosmic inequality without self-pity. He couldn't do it. Couldn't do what I could do. The mechanism wasn't universal, wasn't available, wasn't a technique that could be taught or a skill that could be developed.

It was mine.

"Unfair," he said.

One word. The word contained everything — the recognition of asymmetry, the acceptance of limitation, the acknowledgment that the universe distributed its impossibilities unevenly and that fairness was a human concept that the universe had never signed.

I almost smiled. The almost was as close as I got these days — the humor arrived, registered, produced the ghost of a response, and left before the response could fully form. But the almost was enough. It was the first almost-smile since the village.

"Try the third one," Xu Ran said.

I looked at the largest stone. Looked at a point three meters away. Believed.

It was there.

The moss confirmed it. The earth confirmed it. The world confirmed it. Three meters, a new position, a complete retroactive history of a stone that had always been where it now was.

Xu Ran wrote nothing down. His notebook stayed closed. The data had exceeded the medium.

"It's not will," he said. Statement, not question.

"No."

"It's belief."

"Yes."

"Your belief. Not mine. Not anyone's. Yours."

The words settled into the clearing the way the stones had settled into their new positions — completely, permanently, with the full retroactive weight of something that had always been true.
