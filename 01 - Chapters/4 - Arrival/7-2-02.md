# Chapter 10

The plant bloomed.

Not immediately. Not the way a fist opens or a door swings — not the instant, mechanical response to a command. The bud sat in its pot, closed, green-tight, the compressed potential of a thing that hadn't yet decided to become itself. Xu Ran had bought it at the last village — haggled, overpaid, complained about the price per stem ratio with the indignant thoroughness of a scholar who believed market economics should be governed by the same principles as logic. The plant had survived the climb in his pack, wrapped in damp cloth, the care of a man transporting experimental equipment.

I looked at the bud.

Not willed. Knew. The bloom was — there. Already present, already contained in the tight spiral of petals, already real, waiting only for the arrangement of conditions that would allow the contained thing to express itself. I didn't make the plant bloom. I knew the plant was blooming. The distinction was the lesson.

The petals opened.

Slowly. One, then another, then a third, the spiral unwinding with the patient inevitability of a thing returning to a state it had always preferred. Pink at the edges — the pink of wild mountain flowers, deeper than cherry blossom, lighter than plum, the color of something that had chosen its pigment without human consultation. White toward the center. Yellow at the heart — the concentrated yolk-yellow of pistil and stamen, the reproductive apparatus that the bloom existed to showcase.

The scent arrived. Faint. Sweet in a way that wasn't sugar-sweet but earth-sweet — the fragrance of organic process, of cells opening and releasing the volatile compounds they'd been storing, the olfactory signature of life continuing.

Xu Ran breathed in.

The expression on his face was — I filed it. Stored it in the memory-archive alongside the moments worth keeping. His face, in the presence of a flower that shouldn't have opened, did something I hadn't seen before. The clinical mask didn't crack — it dissolved. For a duration measured in heartbeats, the man behind the scholar was visible: wonder, unprocessed, un-categorized, the raw human response to beauty that preceded thought.

Then the mask reformed. He was a scholar again. He noted the bloom's diameter (writing), the petal count (writing), the estimated acceleration of the growth cycle (writing). But for those heartbeats, he had been only a man watching a flower open.

I did not mention it. Some observations were better left unrecorded.
