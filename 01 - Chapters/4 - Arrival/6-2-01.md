# Chapter 9

We smelled the smoke from three li out.

Xu Ran stopped first. His body registered it before his mind did — the shift in stride, the lifted chin, the nostrils flaring. A human response. A mortal response. The animal recognition of fire where fire shouldn't be.

"That's —" he said, and didn't finish. Dropped his pack. Ran.

I followed. Not because the smoke concerned me — smoke was smoke, fire was fire, the physical world and its physical emergencies had a limited claim on someone who had learned that physical world was negotiable. I followed because Xu Ran was running, and Xu Ran running meant something mattered, and the things that mattered to Xu Ran had a way of mattering to me whether I wanted them to or not.

The village was small. A market square. A handful of houses arranged around a well with the casual geometry of settlements that grow rather than plan. The kind of village where Xu Ran and I had bought rice and salt and the occasional bottle of wine. The kind of village that existed because people needed to exist somewhere, and this somewhere was as good as any other.

They'd set three houses on fire.

Not the whole village — three houses. Precisely three. The precision was the tell. This wasn't destruction — this was provocation. A message. A carefully calibrated measure of pain designed not to kill but to hurt, not to eliminate but to alarm, not to end but to invoke.

The sect cultivators were in the square.

Thirty of them. Not the full hundred and twelve — a detachment. The operational arm of a larger patience. They stood among the villagers with the casual authority of people who had done this before and expected to do it again. No weapons drawn. No cultivation techniques deployed. They didn't need to. Their presence was the weapon. Their cultivation pressure was the technique.

Pencil was not among them. The leadership was elsewhere — watching, presumably. Observing from the ridge. Measuring the response.

The villagers were afraid. The fear had a specific quality — not the sharp, bright fear of surprise but the dull, heavy fear of comprehension. They understood what was happening. They understood that they were instruments. They understood that the fire and the pressure and the thirty cultivators in their square had nothing to do with them and everything to do with something else, something larger, something they couldn't see but could feel the way you feel weather.

A child was crying. Small — four, five years old. Held against its mother's chest with the desperate grip of someone who had run out of other options. The mother's face was blank. Not numb — decided. She'd looked at the situation, calculated the probabilities, and arrived at the conclusion that the best possible action was no action. Hold the child. Be still. Wait.

The cultivators weren't attacking. They were waiting. Standing in the square, among the smoke and the crying and the three burning houses, and waiting for me to arrive.

I arrived.

The thirty faces turned. Not surprised — expecting. The operational arm had deployed with precise knowledge of where I was, how fast I moved, what route I'd take. They'd set the fire at the right distance, produced the right amount of smoke, created the right amount of noise. Calibrated. Calculated. Patient.

I stood at the square's edge. Xu Ran was beside me, breathing hard from the run, his hand on the knife at his belt. The fox-spirit was behind us — tense, low, amber eyes tracking the cultivators with the focused attention of a predator that knew it was outmatched.

The smoke rose. The child cried. A beam collapsed in one of the burning houses, sending sparks and a gust of heat across the square.

The impulse arrived.

Not a thought. Not a plan. Not a strategic assessment or a tactical calculation or any of the cognitive processes that precede deliberate action. An impulse — raw, immediate, pre-verbal. The same impulse that had put my hands on the ground in the dark, the same impulse that had produced the images, the same impulse that lived in the crack behind the wall.

Not *I want them to leave*.

*They are not here.*

The distinction was everything. B6's fundamental lesson — the one I hadn't known I was learning, the one the images had been teaching since Part 1. Belief, not will. Conviction, not desire. The stone isn't moved because you want it moved. The stone IS there because you believe it is there. The belief comes first. The reality follows.

*They are not here.*

I didn't say it. Didn't think it. BELIEVED it.

And they were gone.
