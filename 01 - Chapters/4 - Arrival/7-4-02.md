# Chapter 28

I sat.

Eyes closed. The intentional closure that distinguished meditation from rest — the active darkening, the deliberate removal of visual input, the mind's decision to negotiate with itself without the distraction of the external.

The grass beneath me was real. The stone beneath the grass was real. The air entering my lungs was real and the lungs were real and the ribs around the lungs were real and the body containing all of it was real in the way that real things were real: present, physical, taking up space.

I reached inward.

Not with hands — hands were external, were outward, were the tools I'd learned to use on the world. This was different. This was the interior navigation that had no physical correlate, the turning of attention from the observable to the experiential, from the world-as-object to the self-as-subject.

I am mortal.

The sentence arrived in the mind the way all sentences arrived — as language, as structure, as the arrangement of sounds and meanings that the brain processed into comprehension. I understood it. The three words were English and the English was clear and the clarity was complete.

I am mortal.

I believed it. Pushed the belief inward — not as thought but as conviction, not as statement but as state, the pressure of a mind attempting to make a sentence true by force of wanting it to be true.

Nothing.

Not the nothing of absence — the nothing of refusal. The architectural nothing of a wall that existed precisely where it needed to exist to block precisely what I was trying to do. The wall wasn't external. The wall wasn't constructed. The wall was ME — the configuration of self that had been in place for so long that the self and the wall were indistinguishable.

I am mortal.

MAUER. The German word surfaced unbidden — the older word, the heavier word, the word that carried the weight of stone and permanence and the particular solidity of a thing built to last. The wall was not resistance. Resistance implied an active process, a force opposing a force, the dynamic tension of conflict. This was not conflict. This was architecture. This was the structural reality of a self that had been built to SURVIVE and was now being asked to stop building.

I opened my eyes.

"Nothing," I said.

Xu Ran was beside me. Cross-legged. His brush was out. His eyes were on my face with the analytical attention that he applied to observable phenomena — the documentary gaze that treated symptoms as data and data as path.

"What did you feel?" he asked.

"Resistance."

"Where?"

The question was simple. The answer was not. Where? The resistance wasn't located — wasn't in the chest or the head or the hands or any anatomical district that could be identified and addressed. It was everywhere. It was the self entire. The wall wasn't IN me — the wall WAS me.

"From me," I said.

The words landed in the clearing and changed the morning. Not physically — no temperature drop, no wind shift, no botanical response. The words changed the morning the way understanding changed the morning: by making the previous version of the morning inadequate.

The resistance came from me. Not from the power. Not from the qi. Not from the universe or the rules of reality or the metaphysical architecture that governed immortality and mortality and the boundary between them. From ME. From the part that had known — not believed, KNOWN — for millennia that death was not applicable. That mortality was theoretical. That the sentence "I am mortal" was as meaningful as "I am a stone" — grammatically correct and ontologically false.

"From you," Xu Ran repeated. Confirming. Filing. The documentation of a man who understood that this sentence was the diagnosis.

"From me."

He wrote. The brush moved with the particular speed that indicated importance — the faster strokes, the denser characters, the compression of meaning into ink that characterized his most critical recordings.

"Again?" he asked.

"Tomorrow."

I stood. The clearing was ordinary. The stream ran. The birds sang. The fox-spirit slept or pretended to sleep. The world was entirely, aggressively normal, and the normalcy was the indifference of a reality that had no opinion about a woman's failure to change herself.

I walked to the stream. I washed my face. The water was cold. The cold was external and real and manageable and everything that the internal was not.

Behind me, Xu Ran continued writing. The diagnosis was complete. The patient and the disease were the same entity. The cure required the destruction of the thing being cured.

I dried my face with my sleeve.

Tomorrow.
