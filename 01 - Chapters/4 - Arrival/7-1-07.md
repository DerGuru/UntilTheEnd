# Chapter 7

"Stop forcing it," Xu Ran said.

Evening. Fire. Rice — cooked in the pot he'd un-dented that morning with a flat stone and the determination of a man who refused to let metaphysics dictate his cookware. The rice was adequate. The fire was warm. The conversation was the kind that happened at the end of a day that had been spent failing.

"What else am I supposed to do?" I said.

"You're fighting yourself."

"Against whom should I fight?"

"That is exactly the problem."

The sentence. Simple. Six words. Delivered in his voice — the flat, steady, undecorated voice that carried meaning the way a river carried stones, not clutched but transported, not emphasized but moved. That is exactly the problem.

The fire shifted. A log settled, sending sparks upward, the small fireworks of combustion that lasted a second and then were dark dust falling. I watched them. The brief life of a spark — bright, visible, consumed. The opposite of me.

"Explain," I said.

"You're fighting yourself. The enemy is you. The battlefield is you. The weapon is you. When you win, you lose. When you lose, you win. The combat is the problem — not the opponent."

He was eating while he spoke. Chopsticks between words. Rice between clauses. The multitasking of a man whose mind and mouth operated on different schedules. Their body had learned to feed itself during the gaps.

"You're saying I should stop."

"I'm saying the FIGHTING is what's preventing the CHANGE. You tried to believe yourself mortal and your body responded by cracking stones and bending trees. Not because it was resisting you — because the TRYING was a form of conviction, and conviction is what makes the reality, and the conviction was: I AM DOING BATTLE WITH MY OWN IMMORTALITY. And what did the reality become? A battle."

I looked at the fire. Flames. The, reliable behavior of combustion — fuel, heat, oxygen, the triangle that fire required, the simple physics that produced warmth and light and the cooking of rice. Fire didn't fight. Fire didn't try. Fire consumed what was available and existed as long as the conditions permitted and went out when the conditions changed.

"You're telling me to be a fire," I said.

"I'm telling you to stop being a siege."

The image was absurd. And precise. I had been laying siege to my own conviction — battering rams of deliberate belief, assault after assault, the sustained military effort of someone trying to breach walls that they had built themselves from the inside. And every assault strengthened the walls, because the energy of the assault was conviction, and conviction was the building material.

"You fight against yourself," he repeated. "And the fighting is itself an act of conviction. The conviction says: there is something to fight. There is an enemy. There is resistance. And the reality — which responds to conviction — creates the enemy, creates the resistance, makes them real. You're building the wall you're trying to break by the act of trying to break it."

"That's—"

"Absurd? Yes. So is everything about you."

Almost a smile. His. The micro-expression that cracked the clinical surface for a millionth of a second before the surface healed. The humor that lived in the worst moments, the small rebellion of a mind that refused to be entirely serious even when the subject was life and death and the dissolution of cosmic architecture.

"Then what?" I said.

He set down his chopsticks. The gesture — the deliberate cessation of eating, the physical signal that what followed was important enough to require his body's full attention. He looked at me across the fire. The flames between us, moving, distorting his face into something ancient and wavering.

"Stop fighting. Stop trying. Stop directing conviction at the problem like a weapon. If the fighting is the problem, then the solution is the absence of fighting. Not surrender — the absence of combat. Not losing — the absence of the game."

"That's the same thing I learned at the river. Letting go."

"Is it?"

"Isn't it?"

"At the river you learned that letting go exists. That it's different from willing. That it's the open hand, not the fist. But you haven't DONE it. You've understood it. Understanding is not doing."

He was right. And the rightness was — I sat with it. The fire. The rice. The night. The clouds overhead, thick, obscuring stars, the leitmotiv of a book I was inside of without knowing its title.

"Understanding is not doing," I repeated.

"You understand perfectly how to let go. You cannot do it. Because doing is itself a form of will, and will is the grip, and the grip is what you're trying to release. The paradox is the answer."

"The paradox is the problem."

"Same thing."

We looked at each other across the fire. Two people at the end of possibility — the scholar who could describe the mechanism but not operate it, the immortal who could operate the mechanism but not on herself. Individually insufficient. Together — also insufficient. But together with rice and fire and the fox-spirit sleeping at the edge of the dark and the clouds moving overhead like slow, dissolving thoughts.

"Tomorrow," I said.

"Tomorrow you won't force it."

"I'll try."

"Trying is forcing."

"Then I won't try."

"Better."

He picked up his chopsticks. Resumed eating. The conversation was over. The fire continued. The clouds moved.

The paradox sat between us like a stone in a field, and neither of us moved it, and the not-moving was — possibly — the beginning of an answer.
