# Chapter 24

I stared at my hands.

Not the metaphorical staring — not the introspective gaze that novelists used to indicate internal conflict, the shorthand of self-examination. The actual, physical, sustained staring at skin and bone and the specific topography of two human hands that had existed for millennia and looked like they had done nothing except exist.

They were ordinary. Proportional. The fingers were the right length and the nails were the right shape and the lines in the palms were deep with age that the skin didn't show. They were the hands of a woman who had — what? Worked? Rested? The ambiguity of immortal hands, the specific impossibility of reading a history that spanned thousands of years in the wear patterns of skin that didn't wear.

These hands had killed a forest.

No — these hands hadn't done anything. That was the problem. The hands were innocent. The arms were innocent. The body was innocent. The mechanism of destruction wasn't mechanical — wasn't physical, wasn't anatomical, wasn't located in any system that could be isolated and regulated and controlled. It was somewhere else. Somewhere deeper. Somewhere that had no anatomy and no address and no off switch.

How many times?

The question from the ridgeline was still unanswered. Not because the answer didn't exist but because the answer was too large for the question, the container insufficient for the content. How many times had I unknowingly —

Think. Systematically. Not the spiral that Xu Ran had warned against but the inventory. The catalog. The specific enumeration of instances, even approximate, even partial.

Every death that had mattered. Wei. The others — the names from the flood, the thousand faces that had surfaced and receded. Every death had been accompanied by grief and every grief had been accompanied by —

What? How would I know? I hadn't been looking. I hadn't known to look. The silence around Wei had been the most visible because the silence had been the most complete, the grief so absolute that the effect had been unmistakable. But the others — the smaller griefs, the lesser losses, the deaths that had mattered but not as much — what had those done? Small silences? Minor disruptions? Weather changes that I'd attributed to weather? Animals fleeing that I'd attributed to — animals?

Every time you felt something strongly enough, the world around you changed.

Xu Ran's framework. The specific analytical structure that he'd offered and that I was now applying retroactively to millennia of unexamined experience. The reinterpretation of a life — not the events, which were fixed, but the causality, which was not.

The bird nest. Three eggs. Three dead things that would have been birds that would have been alive that would have been ordinary and common and present. Three dead things because I had felt something near them and the feeling had leaked and the leak had been lethal.

Unforgivable.

The word arrived without being invited. The specific absolute that the mind reached for when proportional language was insufficient, the moral category that existed beyond the scale of ordinary judgment. Not wrong, not tragic, not regrettable — unforgivable. The kind of thing that couldn't be balanced by future good because the future didn't cancel the past and the past contained broken shells and a dead mother and the specific silence of a boy's death expanding outward through a forest like a shockwave made of grief.

"Stop," I said.

To no one. To myself. To the hands that were innocent and the body that was innocent and the self that was — not.

I needed to control it. Not the outward warping — Xu Ran's training had begun addressing that, the exercises with water and flame and plant. The inward warping. The self. The specific internal architecture that converted emotion into reality without consent, the autonomic process that took what I felt and expressed it in physics.

But control required understanding and understanding required examination and examination was — happening. Was underway. Was the specific process of a woman sitting on a mountain looking at her hands and thinking about the inventory of destruction they hadn't committed but she had.

"I need to stop," I said.

Xu Ran was behind me. On the trail. Three steps. He'd returned to three steps — the observational distance, the documentary remove, the specific spatial consideration of a man who understood that some things needed to be confronted without witnesses standing too close.

"Stop what?" he said.

"Feeling."

"That's not possible."

"Then I need to stop — leaking."

"Yes."

"How?"

"I don't know yet."

The honesty was worse than the helplessness. If he'd had an answer — even a wrong answer, even a tentative answer, even a theoretical answer — the path forward would have been visible. But the admission of not-knowing from a man who had made knowing his entire identity was the specific kind of void that swallowed hope.

I looked at the burned feather smell that wasn't there. The olfactory hallucination had become intermittent — arriving and departing without temporal logic, the ghost-scent operating on its own schedule.

Three eggs.

The number was small enough to hold. That was its weight. Three — not a hundred, not a thousand, not the uncountable losses that characterized the rest of the inventory. Three. Specific. Countable. Holdable. The kind of number that the mind could grip without the fingers of comprehension slipping.

Three eggs that I had broken with a feeling.

"Control isn't enough," I said. "I need to stop."

"You said that."

"I mean it differently now."

He waited. The three steps between us were the distance between speaking and being heard, the specific acoustic gap that required intention to cross.

"I've been — I've been treating this as a skill problem. Learn to control it. Get better. Master the technique. But it's not a skill. It's me. The control IS me. If I control it, I'm still the thing that needs controlling. If I master it, I'm still the thing that needs mastering."

"What's the alternative?"

I didn't know. The alternative was the question rather than the answer, the problem rather than the solution. But the question felt closer to true than any answer I'd encountered and proximity to truth was, at this point, the only direction that mattered.

The fox-spirit was watching. Not me — the grass. The grass around my feet was doing the thing again: breathing. Growing. Dying. The involuntary tidal system of a woman's emotions expressing themselves in botany.

Three blades of grass died. I watched them die. Small, green, ordinary, present and then not.

Three for three for three.

I stood. I walked. The hands were still ordinary, still innocent, still the hands of a woman who had done nothing wrong with her hands and everything wrong with everything else.

The mountain continued.

I continued.

The difference between us was that the mountain couldn't help it.
