# Chapter 26

I ate.

For the first time since — I didn't count. Counting required acknowledging the duration and the duration was the kind of number that made the fact worse. Days. Enough days that the body should have protested, should have collapsed, should have done the things that bodies did when denied sustenance. My body didn't do those things. My body persisted because persistence was what it did, the biological stubbornness of a system that refused to degrade regardless of input.

But I ate.

One bite.

The rice was burned. Not catastrophically — not the black char of abandoned cooking, not the acrid ruin of inattention. The subtle burn. The bottom-of-the-pot burn that Xu Ran's cooking consistently produced, the tonal shift from white to amber that indicated a man who understood the procedure but not the timing, who knew the proportions but not the patience, who had mastered the chemistry and failed the art.

It tasted like burned rice.

The texture was the chewiness that overcooking produced when combined with under-stirring — the grains sticking to each other and to the pot and to the memory of what rice was supposed to be. The flavor was smoke and starch and the aftertaste that distinguished edible from optimal, the culinary territory between hunger and satisfaction where most of Xu Ran's cooking resided.

I chewed.

The mechanical process of eating. The muscular activity of a jaw doing what jaws did — the teeth grinding, the tongue positioning, the salivary response that the body produced regardless of the mind's participation. The body ate because the body was offered food and the body was a body and bodies ate. The mind watched the process from a distance that was simultaneously nowhere and everywhere, the internal observation of a self watching itself perform a function it hadn't performed in days.

Xu Ran said nothing.

This was — important. The silence. Not the supportive silence, not the encouraging silence, not the therapeutic quiet of a witness affirming a breakthrough. The nothing-silence. The absence of comment. The particular Xu Ran communication mode that treated an event as being exactly as significant as the event was, which was to say: a woman eating rice.

A woman eating rice.

Not a symbol. Not a turning point. Not the metaphorical consumption that writers used to indicate emotional progress, the ingestion-as-healing, the nourishment-as-recovery. Just — rice. Burned. In a bowl. On a mountain. Eaten by a woman who hadn't eaten in days. Ordinary. Unremarkable. The kind of event that happened everywhere, all the time, to everyone who was alive and hungry and in proximity to food.

The fox-spirit was eating too. Not rice — something it had caught while we weren't watching, something small and furred and now absent. The amber eyes blinked at me from beside the fire with the animal indifference that placed my rice consumption in the correct biological context: organisms ingesting. Standard procedure.

I took a second bite. The burned flavor was consistent. The texture was consistent. Everything about Xu Ran's rice was consistent — reliably mediocre, dependably edible, the culinary middle that represented not excellence but sufficiency.

The fire was low. The evening was arriving — the light going soft, the mountain shadows lengthening, the atmospheric shift that separated day from not-day. The clouds above the ridgeline were moving west. Were they mine? Were they weather? The question had become a background process, the persistent uncertainty running beneath every observation, the OS-level doubt that operated below conscious attention.

I didn't know. I decided not to know. The decision was temporary and insufficient and it was enough.

The bowl was not empty. Three more bites, maybe four, remaining. The partial consumption that indicated beginning rather than completion — the woman had started but hadn't finished, had entered the process but hadn't exhausted it, had demonstrated capability without demonstrating appetite.

I set the bowl down.

The guilt was there. Still. The loop was there. Still. The three eggs and the dead bird and Wei's silence and the thousand faces and the hands and the grass and the circle — all of it, still present, still orbiting, still the mental content that occupied the space between what I was and what I'd done.

But I'd eaten rice.

And the rice had been burned.

And the burn had been natural — a man's imperfect cooking, not a woman's uncontrolled power. The fire had been fire. The pot had been pot. The heat had been fire doing what fire does, not emotion. The rice had burned because rice burned when the cook wasn't careful and the cook wasn't careful because the cook was Xu Ran and Xu Ran's relationship with culinary art was respectful but not intimate.

Normal. The word was foreign. The taste of the word in the mind was strange, the unfamiliarity of a concept that had been absent so long it required reintroduction. Normal. A woman eating burned rice cooked by a man she was traveling with. Normal.

The fire settled. The embers glowed. The mountain continued its patient existence around us, the geological indifference of stone and soil and the mineral stubbornness of a landmass that had been here before anything alive and would be here after.

Xu Ran cleaned the pot. The post-meal procedure — scrubbing with grass and water, the practical domesticity that treated the pot as an object rather than a vessel of meaning. He packed it. He stirred the embers. He unrolled his sleeping mat.

"Tomorrow," he said.

Not a plan. Not a promise. Not the suggestion of future content or the preview of coming instruction. Just: tomorrow. The word that meant only that another day would follow this one and that the following was sufficient.

I lay down. The sleeping mat was thin and the ground was hard and the stars were appearing behind the clouds — behind the clouds that might have been mine, behind the clouds that I was choosing not to investigate.

The bowl beside me. Not empty. Started.

I closed my eyes.

For the first time in days, nothing growing. Nothing dying. The grass around the campsite maintaining its ordinary relationship with night — the photosynthetic dormancy that darkness produced, the biological ceasefire between the sun's departure and return.

Quiet. Real quiet. Mountain quiet.

I fell asleep thinking about rice.
