# Chapter 2

The second attempt was deliberate.

Eyes closed. Hands on my knees — the posture of intention, the bodily arrangement that said: I am focusing now. The air entering my lungs with the measured control of someone preparing for an exertion that was not physical but might as well have been, for the effort it demanded.

"I am mortal," I said.

I pushed. Not with hands, not with qi, not with any of the external instruments of force. With the internal instrument — the one that had been creating reality since before I understood what creating meant. The conviction-engine, the deep machinery of belief that lived beneath thought and above instinct and operated in the space where what-I-know became what-is. I pointed it at the statement and I pushed.

The self-protection responded.

Not like before. Not the wall, not the headaches, not the deletion-mechanism that had operated through suppression and erasure. This was different. The reality around me — the physical, material, here-and-now reality of a mountainside camp — TWITCHED. Like a muscle receiving an unexpected signal. Like a fabric being pulled from beneath.

The tree.

Ten meters away. A pine — mature, rooted, one of the last holdouts before the tree line surrendered to rock. The trunk BENT. Not snapped — bent, the way a tree bends in hurricane wind, except there was no wind. The trunk curved fifteen degrees from vertical, held for a heartbeat, and straightened. The branches shook off pine needles like an animal shaking off water.

"You just bent a tree," Xu Ran said.

I opened my eyes. Looked at the tree. It was straight again — standing as if nothing had happened, the trunk aligned, the branches still. Only the scattered pine needles on the ground testified.

"I did not."

"You did."

"I was trying to —"

"I know what you were trying to do. You tried to believe yourself mortal and instead you bent a tree." He was writing. Fast. The brush moving with the urgency of a man documenting something he hadn't anticipated. "The qi — I could feel it from here. Not directed. Not controlled. It — erupted."

He was right. I could feel the residue — the tingling in my fingers, the vibration in my jaw, the specific aftertaste of power that had discharged without permission. Like a sneeze. Like a reflex. The body's autonomous response to a perceived threat.

The perceived threat was the sentence: I am mortal.

"Again," I said.

"Is that—"

"Again."

Third attempt. Harder. The push was deeper, more committed, the full weight of whatever I could bring to bear pressed against the conviction that sat in my bones like marrow. I am mortal. I am mortal. I am —

The stones. Around the camp — the ordinary, innocuous stones that littered every mountainside — VIBRATED. Not moved. Vibrated. The specific, high-frequency trembling of objects responding to a force that wasn't physical. Three of them cracked. Small fractures, hairline, the kind that stones develop when subjected to temperature extremes or seismic events. Except the temperature was constant and the ground was still.

Grass — the scrub grass that grew in rock crevices — curled. Toward me. Not growing — curling, the blades twisting in my direction the way iron filings orient toward a magnet, the biological response to a force that biology wasn't designed to respond to.

My qi was flaming.

Not the controlled, channeled qi of cultivation. Not the deliberate, shaped qi of the warping. Autonomous qi — the kind that operated without consent, that fired in response to the threat-alarm that my body had raised when I tried to tell it something it didn't want to hear. The qi was defending the conviction. The qi was reinforcing the hold.

"Stop," Xu Ran said.

I stopped. Not because he told me to — because my body told me to. The exhaustion was immediate, draining, the specific depletion that followed the expenditure of force. I sat there, hands on my knees, breathing. The metallic taste was stronger — thick, copper-bright, the taste of a mouth that had been too close to something electrical.

Xu Ran was looking at the grove of bent trees, the cracked stones, the curling grass. His expression was the one he wore when confronted with data that didn't fit his models — the specific, narrowed-eye assessment of a scholar recalculating.

"The problem," he said, "is not that you can't believe it."

I waited.

"The problem is that every part of you DOES believe — that you're immortal. And when you try to contradict that, it doesn't argue. It doesn't resist. It —" he gestured at the tree — "it defends. Autonomously. The way the body pulls a hand from fire."

"I know."

"You know." He wrote something. Underlined it. "How does one unlearn a reflex?"

The question sat in the mountain air between us. The fox-spirit had relocated — it was now twenty meters away, at the edge of the disturbed radius, watching us from a distance that suggested it preferred not to be too close to the next autonomous qi discharge.

How does one unlearn a reflex?

The clouds moved overhead. I watched them. Shapeless. Forming, dissolving, reforming. Clouds didn't have reflexes. Clouds didn't grip. Clouds didn't hold themselves in any particular shape — they were what the wind and the moisture and the temperature made them, moment by moment, without resistance.

I was not a cloud.

I was a fist.

And every time I tried to open, the fist clenched harder.
