# Chapter 18

The fog was mine.

I didn't know that yet — not at the start of the morning, not in the first minutes of walking when the mist sat low and thick in the valley like something poured. I thought it was weather. Mountain weather, the kind that arrived without consultation and departed without announcement, the atmospheric caprice of high altitudes where the difference between cloud and fog was a matter of elevation.

We walked into it. The trail — narrower now, the last suggestion of maintained path giving way to animal tracks and geological accident — disappeared and reappeared in the white, the specific intermittent visibility that fog produced, the world flickering between present and absent with each shift of the moisture.

I stopped.

No reason. No external trigger. The body stopped the way the body sometimes stopped, the legs ceasing their mechanical repetition without instruction from the mind, the halt arriving from somewhere below conscious decision.

A date.

I couldn't determine which. Wei's death? His birthday? The distinction had blurred — not recently, not in the way that recent memories blur into each other, but across the geological timescale that separated now from then. Millennia had sanded the edges off specific dates until all that remained was the feeling: loss-shaped, Wei-colored, the particular shade of absence that his death had painted onto the calendar. The numbers were gone. The feeling was permanent.

"What are you thinking about?" Xu Ran said.

He was beside me. Three steps had become zero steps since the training, the physical closing of distance that mirrored — everything. He could see it. He could see everything about me now, the way a doctor could read a body after years of practice: the micro-expression, the halted stride, the specific posture of a woman standing in fog and thinking about a dead boy.

"Someone who was better than me," I said.

"That's most people."

The delivery. Flat. Perfect. The specific Xu Ran intonation that placed the line exactly on the border between provocation and comfort, the surgical deployment of humor that served as defibrillator for a heart that was threatening to stop.

Almost a smile. The muscles around my mouth attempted the gesture — the upward pull, the contraction, the mechanical process of smiling — and achieved perhaps sixty percent of the intended result before the weight of the memory pulled them back.

Around us, the fog thickened.

Not the gradual thickening of weather patterns responding to temperature and moisture. The immediate, responsive thickening of a medium responding to an emotion. The fog CLOSED. The visibility that had been ten meters became five, became three, the white pressing in from all sides with the specific intimacy of a world wrapping itself around a feeling it was compelled to express.

The fox-spirit was a shape in the white — amber points at knee height, moving, the only color in a colorless world.

I didn't notice the fog was mine. Not yet. The awareness would come later — after the destruction, after the nest, after Xu Ran named what I couldn't. For now, the fog was weather and the weather was cooperating with my mood and the cooperation was coincidence.

Of course it was.

We walked. The fog walked with us. The mountain continued its patient ascent beneath our feet, invisible now, present only as incline and texture and the specific effort of bodies climbing through impedance.

Xu Ran said nothing more. He walked beside me in the white and was quiet and the quiet was the right shape.
