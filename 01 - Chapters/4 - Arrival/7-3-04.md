# Chapter 21

The positive test was his idea.

"Try the opposite," Xu Ran said. We were walking — a different trail now, away from the circle, the mountain providing alternate routes the way mountains did, the geological generosity of a landmass that offered more paths than any single lifetime could exhaust.

"The opposite of what?"

"You know what sadness does. Find out what something else does."

I didn't want to. The reluctance of a body that had just learned it was a weapon and wasn't ready to test its other calibers. But the argument was sound. If destruction had followed grief, then other emotions would follow other feelings, and understanding the full spectrum was — necessary. Unpleasant and necessary, the way most necessary things were.

"Think of the drop," he said.

The water drop. The exercise, the training, the moment when a single drop of water had risen against gravity because I'd believed it could. The memory was clean and precise and untouched by the erosion that affected most memories, the clarity of a moment that had mattered.

I thought about it.

The trail was lined with bushes — low, thorny, the hardy vegetation of high altitudes, plants that had traded beauty for survival and found the exchange adequate. In the bush nearest my left hand, a bud swelled.

Xu Ran saw it before I did. "There."

The bud opened. Not fast — not the explosive bloom of reality-warping dramatic effect — but at a speed that no bud had ever achieved through ordinary botany. The petals unfolded like fingers opening, like a fist releasing something it had been holding, the mechanical poetry of a flower becoming itself in the span of a breath.

White. Small. Five petals. The architecture of a mountain wildflower that hadn't been scheduled to bloom for another two weeks and was now fully open and astonished by its own compliance.

Around it, the grass was greener.

Not dramatically — not the emerald saturation of impossible fertility — but measurably. The shade of green that distinguished well-watered from adequate, the visual marker of a landscape that was receiving more than it needed. The green radiated outward from my feet in an irregular circle, the geometry of feeling rather than mathematics, the organic shape of an emotion expressed in chlorophyll.

"So," Xu Ran said. He stopped walking. He looked at the grass, at the flower, at the evidence of what hope did to the world when the person hoping was me. "Grief destroys. Hope —"

"Grows things."

"Grows things."

We stood in the greener grass and looked at the open flower and the confirmation was worse than the discovery. Because discovery could be anomaly. Confirmation was pattern. And pattern was permanent.

"You're basically a walking ecosystem," Xu Ran said.

I looked at him.

"That was a compliment," he added.

"It wasn't."

He had the decency not to argue. Or perhaps the intelligence — the two being, in his case, functionally identical.

We walked. The grass was greener where I stepped and ordinary where I didn't and the visual trail of my passage was a line of impossible vitality threading through adequate mountain flora. Behind us, the flowers I'd accidentally encouraged were opening one by one, a chain reaction of bloom that followed our path like footprints made of spring.

The burned-feather smell returned.

Not actually — there was no source, no physical origin, no dead bird within range. The smell was memory. The olfactory ghost of the nest, the three broken eggs, the mother who had been ordinary and common and dead. The smell arrived the way memories of destruction arrived: without invitation, at the moment of hope, the cruelty of a mind that refused to let good things exist without their opposite.

The grass around my feet browned. Briefly. The involuntary flicker of feeling-change, the emotional equivalent of a cloud passing the sun — temporary, measureable, indicative.

"I saw that," Xu Ran said.

"Saw what?"

"The grass. You thought about something and the grass responded."

"I thought about the nest."

He said nothing. He walked. The brush was out — he was writing while walking now, the multitasking of a man who had decided that documenting was more important than looking where he was going.

"Every emotion," I said. "Not just the big ones."

"No."

"Every flicker. Every — passing thought."

"Apparently."

The mountain didn't care. The trail continued its patient ascent and the rocks were rocks and the sky was the blue of altitude, the deep saturated blue that existed only where the air was thin enough to stop pretending. The clouds moved. They WERE moving — naturally, weatherly, the ordinary transit of water vapor responding to pressure gradients and temperature differentials and nothing else.

Or were they?

I looked at the clouds and didn't know if the clouds were clouds or if the clouds were me and the not-knowing was the entire problem.

The fox-spirit walked through the greener grass. Its amber eyes reflected the open flowers. It didn't seem concerned. It didn't seem anything. It was a fox-spirit walking through a reality that responded to the feelings of one woman and it accepted this the way it accepted everything — with the animal neutrality of a creature that distinguished only between threat and not-threat and found both of these categories adequate.

We camped early. The sun was still above the ridge when Xu Ran stopped and set the pack down and began the fire procedure.

"Why are we stopping?" I asked.

"Because you're tired."

"I'm not tired."

"Your grass is getting patchy."

I looked down. The green around my feet was inconsistent — lush in spots, ordinary in others, the visual stutter of an emotion that was running out of energy. He was right. He was always right about the body, his and mine, the observational skill of a man who had learned to read exhaustion in the gradient of grass color.

I sat.

The fire was small and the rice was cooking and the evening was arriving with the gentleness of mountain evenings, the light going gold and then orange and then the purple that existed between day and night, the color of transition.

I thought about the nest again. The smell returned — faint, organic, wrong. Around my feet, a small circle of grass died. Three blades. The miniature of the morning's destruction — not a forest now, just three blades of grass, three small green things that stopped being green because a woman thought about three small eggs that had stopped being eggs.

Three for three.

The symmetry wasn't poetic. It was mechanical.

I stopped thinking about the nest. The grass stayed dead.

Some things, once killed, didn't come back.
