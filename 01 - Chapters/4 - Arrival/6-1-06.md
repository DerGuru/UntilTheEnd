# Chapter 6

We walked in silence for most of the morning.

The silence was different from previous silences — not the companionable quiet of two people who had run out of things to say, not the tense quiet of two people who had too much to say and hadn't decided how. This silence had texture. Weight. The specific density of a man gathering his thoughts into a shape precise enough to survive contact with the thing he needed to say.

Xu Ran was building a sentence.

I could feel it. The way you feel weather changing — not the change itself but the pressure that precedes it, the atmospheric compression that signals what's coming. He walked behind me, three steps back, his breathing measured, his footsteps deliberate, and the sentence grew between us like the tree had grown in the clearing: slowly, then all at once, then retroactively always.

He said it at noon.

We'd stopped at a stream — a normal stream, flowing downhill, obeying the fundamental laws that most water still obeyed. I was filling the water skins. He was sitting on a rock. The fox-spirit was drinking from the stream's edge, its tongue quick and precise.

"You're different," he said.

I didn't look up. "Different how?"

"Calmer."

The word hung. I finished filling the water skin. Capped it. Set it beside the other one. Performed the small, physical actions of a person engaged in a tangible task, because tangible tasks were the opposite of the conversation we were about to have and I wanted to hold on to them as long as possible.

"That scares me more than your anger," he said.

I looked at him then.

He was watching me with the expression I'd learned to read over the past months — the one that was neither clinical nor emotional but somewhere precisely between. The observer who cared. The researcher who loved the subject. The man who wrote everything down because writing was the only way he knew to hold on to things that kept changing.

"My anger?"

"B5. The field. The deductions. The rage when you found the rules and the rules were wrong. That was — I understood that. That was a person finding out they'd been lied to. That was proportionate."

"And this isn't."

"This is you sitting by a stream filling water skins while reality rewrites itself around you and a hundred cultivators harvest your unconscious power from a ridge and you — you're filling water skins."

He was right. I was calm. Not the performed calm of someone pretending to be in control — that was a trick I'd used before and Xu Ran had learned to see through it the way you learn to see through stage magic. Not the numb calm of shock, either — the glazed, empty calm of someone whose emotional responses have shut down under load. I'd felt that too and this wasn't it.

This was something else. This calm came from somewhere deep — from the crack, from the place where the wall was thinning, from the space where the images had taken up residence. The hands. The light. The creating. Since the images had arrived, since they'd refused to leave, since I'd stopped pushing and let them stay, there had been a quiet in me that I didn't recognize. A settling. As if something inside had stopped struggling against something else and the cessation of struggle had produced a calm that was either peace or surrender.

I didn't know which.

"I don't understand it either," I said.

"That's what scares me."

"That I'm calm?"

"That you don't understand why." He leaned forward, elbows on his knees. "You understood your anger. You understood your fear. You understood the wall and the erasure and the field and everything that happened in B5 — not immediately, but eventually, you understood it, and the understanding gave you something to work with. A lever. A position."

"And now?"

"Now you're calm for no reason while things happen that should terrify you and you're — accepting it. Like someone who's stopped fighting a current. That's either wisdom or it's drowning."

The stream moved past us. Normal stream. Normal water. Normal direction. The fox-spirit finished drinking and settled on the bank, its amber eyes half-closed. The noon light was warm and even, without the theatrical quality that dramatic moments usually demanded.

I considered his words the way I was learning to consider things — slowly, without the urgency that had characterized my thinking in B5. He was right that the calm was unexplained. Right that unexplained calm was more alarming than explained fear. Right that wis dom and drowning looked identical from the outside and sometimes from the inside too.

But he was wrong about one thing.

"I'm not accepting it," I said. "I'm not fighting it either. I'm — waiting."

"For what?"

"I don't know."

"That's not better."

"I know."

He sat with that. The sitting — his particular gift, the willingness to hold discomfort without moving. The stream ran. The sun moved. A bird — maybe the new one, the three-note one, the one that hadn't existed until yesterday — called from somewhere in the canopy.

"The images," he said. "From yesterday. The hands."

"They're still there."

"Still the same?"

"Quieter. Like — background noise. Something running constantly that you stop hearing after a while."

"But you haven't forgotten them."

"No."

"And the wall?"

"Doesn't react. Not to the images, not to the calm, not to anything since B5. It's still there — I can feel it. But it's not — active. Like a guard sleeping at his post."

Xu Ran processed this. I could see the information moving through him — the new data incorporating itself into whatever model he was building, the model he kept in the notebook he no longer opened. He was building the model in his head now. The notebook was closed because the data had outgrown the medium.

"You said the editing is retroactive," he said. "That when something changes, everyone's memory changes with it. Except yours."

"Yes."

"And you said you don't know how you're producing the changes."

"Yes."

"But you said — last night. You said something and then you stopped."

I remembered. The thought that had arrived fully formed — *I was immune to the editing because the editing was mine* — and the push, the reflex, the habit of not-thinking-further that had carried me safely through centuries of not-knowing.

"You heard that?"

"I heard you start a sentence and swallow it. I've been watching you do that for six months. I know what it looks like."

Silence. The stream. The bird. The fox-spirit's slow breathing.

"What were you going to say?" he asked.

"Something I'm not ready to say."

He nodded. This was acceptable. This was the agreement they'd developed — the protocol of a relationship built on trust and patience and the understanding that some things needed to arrive at their own speed.

"When you're ready," he said.

"When I'm ready."

He stood. Picked up his pack. Adjusted the straps with the practiced efficiency of a man who had carried weight across mountains before and would do it again and considered the carrying a reasonable price for the arriving.

"I'd prefer it if you were ready soon," he said. "The calm ones are always closer to the edge than they think."

He walked. I watched him walk — the human gait, the mortal steps, the back that carried its years without complaint.

He wasn't wrong.
