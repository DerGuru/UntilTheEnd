# Chapter 46

The village is twenty houses and a well and a market that operates on Tuesdays and Fridays and a rhythm that has been running longer than any of its inhabitants can remember.

She finds a house. Small. One room. A stove. A bed — hard, the mineral firmness of a mattress that has been compressed by years of sleepers into something closer to board than cushion. A garden behind the house, overgrown, the weeds occupying the space with the particular territorial confidence of vegetation that has not been challenged in years.

The landlord has more houses than teeth. Three of each, roughly. He stands in the doorway and names a price and she pays it — coins from somewhere, the financial residue of a life that has passed through economies like water through gravel, accumulating small amounts in the crevices. He counts the money with his fingers and his gums and leaves.

She sweeps.

The broom is a broom — stiff bristles, wooden handle, the utilitarian tool that has not improved in design since its invention because the design was already optimal. She sweeps the floor. Dust rises. She coughs. The cough is — real. The respiratory irritation of particulate matter in the throat, the physical response that the qi would normally suppress and is — not suppressing. Not entirely. Enough dust gets through to make her cough.

She sweeps anyway.

The dust settles on new surfaces and she sweeps those surfaces and the dust rises and settles again and the cycle is the Sisyphean domesticity of floor-cleaning, the perpetual negotiation between clean and not-clean that every person who has ever held a broom understands.

Wei's voice.

It arrives during the sweeping — not summoned, not sought, the uninvited memory that surfaces when the mind is occupied with something too mechanical to require full attention. His voice, clear and flat and unimpressed with everything including the concept it is expressing:

"Then stop being afraid."

She holds the broom still.

Four words. The Wei compression that reduced complex problems to simple instructions, the rhetorical strategy of a boy who had no patience for nuance and no respect for complexity. Stop being afraid. As though fear were a coat that could be removed. As though being afraid were a choice that could be unchosen. As though the millennia-old architecture of self-preservation could be shut down by the decision to — stop.

Simple. Direct. Unimpressed.

So Wei.

She stands in the middle of the dusty room with the broom motionless in her hands and Wei's voice fading back to wherever Wei's voice lives when it is not being useful. The dust is settling. The light through the window is afternoon light, gold and angular, cutting across the floor in the geometric pattern that windows produce when the sun is low enough to enter horizontally.

She sweeps. Because what else should she do?

Outside, the village is doing what villages do. Roosters. Children. The auditory wallpaper of communal human life — voices at varying intensities, footsteps on packed earth, the creak of a cart on the main path. The sound of twenty households existing simultaneously, each producing its own acoustic contribution to the collective composition.

She sweeps the dust out the door. Into the afternoon. Into the light. Into the village that is living around her with the indifferent vitality of a community that does not know what she is and would not care if it did.

The fox-spirit is on the bed. Already. The territorial claim of an animal that identifies comfortable surfaces and occupies them with the absolute certainty that the occupation is justified. Amber eyes watching the sweeping. Unimpressed.

Everyone is unimpressed with her.

She continues sweeping. The floor emerges — wooden, worn, the patina of boards that have been walked on for decades, each plank carrying the traffic patterns of previous inhabitants in the grain-deep tracks of footsteps and furniture legs and the general evidence of lived life.

She is here. In a village. With a broom. In a house that costs coins and has a hard bed and a wild garden and a floor that needs sweeping.

This is either the last place or the next place and the distinction is a question she does not need to answer yet.

She sweeps.
