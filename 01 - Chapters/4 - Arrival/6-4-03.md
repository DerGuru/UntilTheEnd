# Chapter 25

Xu Ran shook my shoulder.

Gently first. Then harder. The desperation of a man who had spent three hours talking to someone who wasn't home, who had tried everything — voice, touch, the name spoken in every tone from whisper to shout — and had arrived at the physical option because the other options had been exhausted.

I blinked.

The present arrived — sharp, violent, the sensory assault of a consciousness returning to a body that had been running on automatic. Everything was too much. The light was too bright. The air was too cold. The grass was too green. Each stimulus arrived at full volume, unfiltered, unmodulated, as if the senses had been recalibrated during the absence and the new calibration was set to maximum.

"How long was I gone?"

"Three hours."

His face. Tired — not the physical tiredness of exertion but the deep tiredness of sustained concern, three hours of watching and writing and not knowing and not being able to help. His eyes were red. His hand, when he removed it from my shoulder, trembled.

I reached for the ground. My hand found the grass — each blade individual, each blade vivid, each blade impossibly specific in its greenness and its shape and its particular relationship to the soil that held it. I gripped. Hard. The grass resisted, then yielded, then held. Real. Solid. Present.

I needed the earth under me. Needed the physical, tangible, gravitational confirmation that I was HERE. Not before everything. Not in the place of creation. Here. In a clearing. On a mountain. With a man who carried a notebook and a knife and a patience that exceeded the patience of anyone who had ever lived.

"You were speaking," he said. "Words I didn't recognize. Old. I wrote what I could."

His notebook was in his lap. Open. Pages filled with his tight, rushed handwriting — lines of transcription, of observation, of the methodical recording of a process he'd watched from outside. Three hours of careful documentation. Three hours of doing the only thing he could.

I didn't look at what he'd written. Not yet. The memory was still reverberating — the echoes of the creation, the afterimage of the place before places, the residual sensation of a self that had existed before the world and had believed the world into existence.

The reframing happened fast.

Not gradually — fast. Like a lens clicking into focus, like the moment when a hidden image in a pattern suddenly resolves and you can't unsee it. The entire history of my life — of all my lives, of every book, every experience, every moment recorded and unrecorded — rotated. Shifted. Showed its other face.

The healings in the first book. Not external protection. Not a guardian entity. Me. My belief that I couldn't be harmed, operating automatically, unconsciously, translating itself into physical invulnerability with the same mechanism that translated stones into new positions and water into new directions. Every healing. Every survival. Every impossible recovery. Mine.

The coincidences in the second. The paths that opened. The weather that changed. The people who appeared. Not luck. Not chance. Not the benevolent intervention of a universe that cared. My belief shaping the world around me — clearing paths because I believed in clear paths, changing weather because I believed in favorable weather, producing coincidences because I believed in outcomes that required them.

Wei.

The image flashed — Wei's face, too young, too stubborn, the settlement gate, the cultivator's technique, the fall. My belief that everything I loved died, manifesting with the same automatic, unconscious authority as my belief that I couldn't burn. The deep conviction overriding the surface wish. The pattern, not the murder. The fresh wound, reopened.

The Monolog-Spaltung. The second voice — the voice that had said *Not now* and *Enough* and *Keep going* throughout B5. Not a foreign presence. Not an intrusion. Not an external voice speaking into my consciousness from outside. Me. A part of me that KNEW. A part that had always known what the wall was hiding, that had been speaking from behind the barrier, that had been trying to tell me in the only way the wall allowed — three words at a time, cryptic, urgent, compressed.

The voice was mine. Had always been mine.

The anomalies. The shockwave. The field. The missing mountain. The reflection that smiled before I did. All of it — every impossible thing, every breach of physics, every violation of the rules that the world was supposed to follow — mine. My belief. My conviction. My unconscious, unintentional, persistent reshaping of reality to match the architecture of my deepest certainties.

The reframing was not a thought. It was an experience — physical, visceral, the sensation of everything you've ever known turning inside out and revealing that the inside had always been the outside and the thing you'd been looking at was the thing you'd been looking from.

I hadn't been surprised.

That was the strange part. The reframing — the complete, total, fundamental revision of my understanding of my own existence — produced not shock but confirmation. The confirmation I'd feared. The specific, terrible confirmation that arrives when the thing you suspected turns out to be true and the truth is worse than the suspicion because the suspicion allowed doubt and the truth does not.

I'd known. Some part of me — the part behind the wall, the part that spoke in three-word fragments, the part that smiled in reflections — had always known. The reframing was not new information. It was old information finally acknowledged.

I sat in the grass. The clearing was bright. The fog was gone. The sun was direct and honest and showed everything without mercy.

I knew.
