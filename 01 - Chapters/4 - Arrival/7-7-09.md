# Chapter 62

She packs.

There is not much. The specific minimal possessions of a woman who has lived in a village for years without accumulating — a few clothes, a bowl, a cup, the chipped ceramic that has become hers through the specific alchemy of daily use. She does not take the bowl. She does not take the cup. She leaves them on the table — clean, positioned, the specific deliberate arrangement of objects being left behind for whoever comes next.

The neighbor is in the doorway before she reaches it.

"I'm going," she says.

The neighbor's face does the thing — the rapid assessment, the visual scan that processes information faster than speech. The packed bag. The empty shelves. The positioned bowl.

"Where?"

"Home."

"You HAVE a home."

The neighbor gestures — at the house, at the garden, at the plum tree that is in autumn and losing its leaves with the specific seasonal resignation that deciduous trees perform. At the village. At the specific accumulated geography of a life lived in a place for long enough that the place has become the word.

"A different one," she says.

The neighbor looks at her. The specific long look of a woman who has shared rice and wrinkle commentary and the particular intimate proximity of village neighbors who know more about each other than either has disclosed. The look contains — things. Things that the neighbor will not say because the neighbor's communication style is declarative rather than confessional.

"Your rice is good now," the neighbor says.

"Thank you."

"Don't get lost."

It is as close to goodbye as the neighbor will come. The specific emotional restraint of a woman who expresses affection through practical instruction — don't get lost, the imperative that contains within it the implication that the getting-lost would matter, that the person being instructed is worth the instruction.

She leaves the house. The door closes behind her. The well is there. The garden is there. The plum tree is there — bark grey, branches bare, the specific winter-approaching architecture of a tree that will continue its cycle regardless of who lives in the house beside it.

The path out of the village leads uphill. She walks. Slowly — the body is older now, the joints stiffer, the specific biomechanical resistance that aging introduces into the process of locomotion. Her knees negotiate with the incline the way old knees negotiate with all inclines: cautiously, with the particular deliberate placement of feet that indicates the body is no longer taking stability for granted.

"Will you come back?"

She stops. Turns.

The Counter. Standing on the path behind her. Taller now — eleven, twelve, the specific half-formed height of a child between childhood and whatever comes after. Her face is serious. The counting face. The face that applies numerical analysis to every situation including this one.

"No," she says.

Honest. The specific direct honesty that the Counter deserves — the child who counts everything and therefore deserves to be counted upon for truth. No. She will not come back. This is a one-direction journey, and the direction is — final.

"But you'll remember me," the Counter says.

Not a question. A statement. The specific Counter-confidence of a child who understands that she is memorable because she is specific, because her counting is unique, because the world does not contain another person who would count a stranger's wrinkles with the same methodical devotion.

"Your wrinkles," the Counter adds. As though specifying. "I'll remember your wrinkles. There were too many."

She looks at the child. The child looks at her. The exchange is — she collects it. This one. The last one from this village. The Counter on the path with the serious face and the numbers.

"Everything," she says. "I'll remember everything."

The Counter nods. Satisfied. She turns and walks back toward the village, counting steps as she goes. The specific retreating enumeration of a child returning to her domain.

She watches the Counter go. Then turns. Continues uphill.

The path is steep. Her knees protest. The fox-spirit walks beside her — lower to the ground now, or she is higher off it, the specific relative positioning that changes when one party shrinks and the other doesn't. The amber eyes are steady. The fox-spirit does not count. The fox-spirit does not remember. The fox-spirit walks.

She thinks, briefly, of a notebook. Of a man who carried one. Of the specific worn leather and stained pages and dots where characters should have been. Of a man who recorded everything because everything deserved recording and walked away with the recording and did not look back.

She does not look back.

The village recedes. The path narrows. The mountain receives her with the specific geological indifference that mountains apply to all travelers — come or go, the stone is the stone, the slope is the slope, the altitude is the altitude.

She climbs. Old knees. White hair. The specific visible effort of a body that is mortal and aging and climbing anyway.

Above her, the clouds are — dissolving. The afternoon light breaking through, the specific intermittent illumination that occurs when cloud cover thins, the world brightening and dimming and brightening with the rhythm of atmospheric change.

She climbs toward the light.
