# Chapter 20

He named it the next morning.

We'd camped — if you could call it camping — at the edge of the destruction circle, where the living forest met the dead ground, where trees still stood but the air tasted of dust and the birds hadn't returned. I hadn't slept. Not from choice but from the insomnia of a body that didn't trust itself to be unconscious, the refusal to release control when control had proven to be an illusion.

Xu Ran had slept. Of course he had. The man had the talent of sleeping where and when he chose, the metabolic discipline of someone who understood that rest was not optional and that guilt was not an adequate substitute.

He made tea. The fire was small and careful and the pot was the same pot he'd been carrying since — how long? The indefinite duration of shared travel, the accumulation of days into something that defied simple counting.

"When you got sad," he said, "the trees died."

He said it the way he said everything — flat, measured, the tonal absence that was his primary communication mode. No accusation. No weight. The factual register of a man reporting observation.

"Correlation isn't causality," I said.

The response was automatic — the intellectual reflex of a mind that had spent millennia constructing arguments as defense mechanisms, the deployment of logic as shield. The philosophical position was sound. Two events occurring simultaneously did not establish a causal relationship. The fact that my emotion and the destruction had coincided temporally did not prove that one had produced the other.

The position was sound and it was wrong.

"That IS causality," Xu Ran said. "I saw it."

He poured the tea. The liquid steamed into the morning air and the steam was ordinary and the ordinariness was the point.

"You were thinking about something. Your face changed. The fog thickened. Then —" He gestured at the circle. The geometry of absence behind us, the architectural void where forest had been. "That's not correlation. That's not even causality in the philosophical sense. That's you making the weather do what you feel."

I drank the tea. It was adequate — not good, not bad, the median quality that Xu Ran's tea consistently achieved, the Platonic form of drinkable.

He was right. I knew he was right. The knowledge had arrived during the sleepless night, the understanding that built itself from evidence rather than argument. The fog had been mine. The thickening had followed the feeling. The burst had followed the memory. The destruction had followed the grief. The causal chain was unbroken and unambiguous and the only thing preventing me from accepting it was the implication.

If my emotions shaped reality —

If every feeling I had was not merely internal but external, not merely experienced but expressed, not merely suffered but inflicted —

Then every emotion was a risk.

Every moment of grief was a potential forest. Every pulse of anger was a possible — what? Earthquake? Flood? The destruction of things that had done nothing except exist within the radius of my feeling?

"Don't do that," Xu Ran said.

"Do what?"

"Spiral." He set his cup down. "I can see it. Your eyes go somewhere else when you spiral. You stop looking at what's in front of you and start looking at everything that could go wrong."

"Everything IS going wrong."

"No. One thing went wrong. You destroyed some trees. Things happen."

"I killed a bird."

He paused. The Xu Ran pause that meant he was editing his response, removing the first thing he was going to say and replacing it with the second, the internal revision process that made his speech slower but more precise.

"Yes," he said. "You did."

No mitigation. No it-wasn't-your-fault, no you-didn't-mean-to, no the-world-will-balance-it-out. The bare acknowledgment of fact, the respect of treating the event as real rather than smoothing it into something bearable.

"So what do I do?"

"Learn," he said. "That's the whole structure. That's why we're here. You learn what you are and then you learn to be it differently."

I looked at the circle. The dust had settled overnight. The bare earth was visible — brown and ordinary, the colorless real of soil exposed to air when the things that had been growing in it were removed. The smell of burned feathers was gone. The morning wind had taken it.

"Every emotion," I said. "Every single one."

"Apparently."

"For how long?"

"What do you mean?"

"How long have I been — doing this?" I gestured at the circle. At the fog. At the dead bird I couldn't see anymore but could still see. "Millennia? Since the beginning?"

He didn't answer immediately. He picked up the brush. He wrote something — a single character, quick, the ink still wet when he set the brush down.

"That's a good question," he said. "That's the first good question you've asked."

The fox-spirit was sitting at the edge of the destruction circle, its amber eyes watching the place where the forest stopped being forest. It hadn't moved during the burst — or it had and had returned. Its position was the calm of an animal that understood something about the event that the humans didn't.

I finished the tea. It was cold.

"Every emotion," I said again. Testing the shape of the sentence. Finding it impossible. Finding it true.

Xu Ran packed up the fire. Methodical. The procedure of departing a campsite, the mechanical sequence that anchored movement in routine.

We walked. The circle shrank behind us. The living forest received us back the way forests did — without ceremony, without judgment, with the indifference of a forest that absorbed destruction and grew around it.

I tried to feel nothing.

That didn't work either.
