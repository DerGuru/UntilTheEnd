# Chapter 4

Three more changes by evening.

A rock face that had smoothed itself into a wall — polished, almost glassy, catching the late light like a mirror I hadn't asked for. The wildflowers at the trail's edge, which had been white yesterday and were now a deep violet that streaked toward black at the edges, as if someone had adjusted the color with absolute confidence and absolute indifference to consistency. A bird call I didn't recognize — a three-note pattern, low and resonant, that the fox-spirit tracked with the focused attention of a predator hearing something that shouldn't exist.

Each change was small. Each change was complete. Each change carried with it the full weight of a past that hadn't happened — the smooth rock face had been smooth for millennia, the flowers had always been violet, the bird had always sung this particular three-note pattern in this particular valley.

Each change was retroactive.

The retroactivity was the part that made my stomach turn. Not the changes themselves — changes happen, anomalies produce changes, the world has been rearranging itself around me for months and the rearrangement was no longer surprising. But the retroactivity — the complete, seamless replacement of one version with another, the past rewritten without scars, without evidence, without the courtesy of leaving a trace of what had been — that was different. That was new. That was something that required a level of precision and authority that simple anomalies didn't have.

Simple anomalies broke rules. These changes wrote new ones.

Xu Ran made camp at sunset. Efficient, methodical — the fire where it belonged, the bedrolls where they belonged, the perimeter check that had become reflexive since the sect had stopped being ignorable. He moved through the routine with the practiced ease of a man who had done this a hundred times, and I watched him move and thought about how comforting it was to watch someone do something ordinary. Something that stayed the same from one day to the next. Something that didn't retroactively rewrite itself into a different version.

"The flowers were white yesterday," I said.

He was poking the fire with a stick. Didn't look up. "What flowers?"

"At the trailside. The ones that are violet now."

"They've always been violet."

I knew he would say that. I'd known before I asked, the way you know the end of a sentence before the speaker finishes it — the pattern was established, the grammar was clear, the conclusion was inevitable. The flowers had always been violet for him. The tree had always been there. The stone had always faced east. The water had always run uphill. The rock face had always been smooth.

Reality changed, and Xu Ran's memory changed with it, and the only memory that didn't change was mine.

"Something is happening," I said.

He looked up from the fire. The flames moved across his face — light and shadow, warmth and motion, the ordinary physics of combustion. "You've been saying variations of that sentence for six months."

"This is different."

"You've said that too."

The dry humor. The careful lightness. The bridge he built over every difficult conversation, the handrail on every steep descent. But beneath it — I could see it now, with the sharpened perception that the crack had left me — beneath it, he was watching me. Really watching. The pencil wasn't in his hand but the observation was still happening, the cataloging, the quiet accumulation of data about what I was and what I was becoming.

"The changes are retroactive," I said. "When something changes, it doesn't just change now. It changes always. Everyone remembers the new version. Everyone's memory gets rewritten. Except mine."

He was quiet for a moment. The fire cracked. A log shifted, sending sparks upward.

"How many?" he said.

"Today? Six. Seven, if you count the bamboo."

"What bamboo?"

"Exactly."

The word landed. He heard it — the specific weight of an *exactly* that was confirmation, not agreement. The bamboo that he remembered walking through, that his body knew, that his feet had found automatically — the bamboo didn't exist yesterday. Hadn't existed at all. Was new in the world and old in his memory and I was the only one who could see the seam.

He sat with that.

I liked that about him — the sitting. The willingness to hold an idea without immediately responding to it, without defending his version, without insisting that the bamboo had always been there because his memory said so. He sat with the possibility that his memory was a draft that had been edited. He sat with the possibility that I was the only reader who remembered the earlier version.

"The tree too?" he said.

"The tree too."

"I remember you planting it."

"I know."

"I can see it. Your hands in the dirt. The rain."

"I know."

He looked at the fire again. The firelight did things to his face that faces shouldn't allow — it made the lines deeper, the shadows heavier, the years more visible. He looked old. Not the cultivator-old, the timeless, preserved, functionally-immortal old that I was. Human old. Thirty-five years of living written across his features in the honest, irreversible language of aging.

"That scares you," he said.

"Yes."

"Not the changes."

"No."

"The retroactivity."

"The fact that no one knows except me. The fact that reality rewrites itself and everyone agrees with the rewrite and I'm the only one standing in the clearing saying *that tree wasn't here yesterday*. That makes me either the only one who sees the truth or the only one who's wrong."

The fire burned. The sparks rose. The fox-spirit lay at the camp's edge, amber eyes half-closed, watching nothing. Or watching the thing it had been tracking all day — the invisible presence, the movement in the air, the something that wasn't there until it was and then had always been.

"You're not wrong," Xu Ran said.

"How do you know?"

"Because the things you describe as changes make sense as changes. A tree doesn't grow overnight. Water doesn't run uphill. Flowers don't change color. The fact that I remember them differently doesn't mean you're wrong — it means my memory was changed and yours wasn't."

The logic was his gift. The careful, methodical, evidence-based reasoning that treated reality as a problem to be solved rather than a condition to be suffered. He couldn't see the changes. He couldn't remember the previous versions. But he could follow the logic from *trees don't grow overnight* to *something is editing reality* to *Yun is the only one immune to the editing* with the same precision that had led him through every notebook page, every observation, every careful, accumulated detail.

"Why you?" he said. "Why can you see it?"

I didn't answer. I knew why. The images from this morning — the hands, the light, the creating — pulsed in the background of my perception. The metallic taste was constant now, a flavor I was learning to live with the way you learn to live with tinnitus or chronic pain. Something you carry.

I didn't answer because the answer was in the images, and the images were in the crack, and the crack was in the wall, and the wall was the thing that had been keeping me from knowing what I was for longer than I could measure.

Something flickered at the edge of the thought — a shape, half-formed, too fast to hold. The sense that the immunity and the editing weren't separate things. That they belonged together in a way I couldn't articulate and wasn't ready to.

The wall did nothing.

I let the flicker dissolve. Not pushing. Just — not reaching for it.

Force of habit.
