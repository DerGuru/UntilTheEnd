# Chapter 10

Gone.

Not slowly. Not with the theatrical fading that cultivation techniques produced — the dissolving, the dimming, the gradual reduction of presence from visible to invisible. Gone in a blink. The specific, absolute gone of something that had been here and was now not-here, with no transition between the two states.

Thirty cultivators. One moment in the square. The next moment not.

The absence was louder than the presence.

The fires still burned. The smoke still rose. The child still cried. The world continued its physical operations with perfect indifference to the fact that thirty people had just been removed from it. The flames didn't notice. The smoke didn't adjust. The child didn't stop crying because the source of the fear was gone — the fear had become its own entity, self-sustaining, independent of cause.

The square was empty.

I stood in it. Xu Ran stood beside me. The villagers stood in their doorways and behind their walls and in the spaces where they'd been when the cultivators had arrived. Nobody moved. Nobody spoke. The silence had the specific weight of something that was not the absence of sound but the presence of understanding — the collective, simultaneous recognition that something had happened that shouldn't happen, couldn't happen, didn't happen, had happened.

I found them later. In my mind — not visually, not through any sense I could name, but through the same channel that had allowed me to believe them gone. I found them two hundred meters away, in the forest, scattered among the trees like leaves after a storm. Disoriented. Some standing, some kneeling, some on the ground. One was vomiting. Another was touching his own face with the slow, wondering investigation of someone who wasn't sure it was still there.

They weren't hurt. Not a scratch, not a bruise, not a hair displaced. I hadn't attacked them. Hadn't used force. Hadn't done anything that could be described in the vocabulary of combat. I had believed them elsewhere, and they were elsewhere, and the believing was all it took.

The vomiting cultivator was on all fours. I could feel his confusion — not empathetically, not with any emotional resonance, but factually. He was confused. The confusion was a feature of his current state, as measurable as his body temperature or his heart rate. He didn't know what had happened. He didn't know where he was. He had been in a village square and now he was in a forest and the gap between the two locations was not a journey but a revision.

I looked at my hands.

They were steady. No trembling, no aftershock, no physiological evidence of extreme exertion. Whatever I'd done hadn't required force. Hadn't required effort. Hadn't required anything except the belief — the complete, absolute, unquestioning belief that thirty people were not where they appeared to be.

Conviction, not will.

The distinction crystallized. I'd been pushing against things my whole life — pushing against the wall, pushing against the erasure, pushing against the world's insistence on being one way when I needed it to be another. Pushing was will. Pushing was effort. Pushing was the mortal's paradigm: apply force, overcome resistance, achieve change.

This wasn't pushing. This was stating.

*They are not here.* Not a desire. Not a command. A fact. The same kind of fact as *the sun rises* or *water flows downhill*. Except that this fact hadn't existed until I believed it, and the moment I believed it, it became retroactively, permanently, unquestionably true.

A woman stepped out of a doorway. Middle-aged. Hard hands. An apron stained with something domestic — flour, oil, the evidence of a morning spent in a kitchen before the morning was interrupted by cultivators and fire and the sudden disappearance of thirty people. She looked at me.

The look was not gratitude.

I'd expected — no. I hadn't expected gratitude. But I'd expected something other than what I found in her face, which was fear. Pure, primal, undiluted fear. The fear of someone who has just watched a woman make thirty people vanish by standing still and looking at them.

I was not a savior. I was a new category of threat.

"We should go," Xu Ran said. His voice was low. Not urgent — careful. The voice of a man who understood that the woman's fear was appropriate and that our presence was the cause of the fear and that the appropriate response to being the cause of fear was to leave.

An old man stood near the well. His hand was raised — pointing at me. Not aggressively, not accusingly. The gesture of someone whose body was performing an action his mind hadn't authorized. He pointed. His mouth was open. Nothing came out.

The child had stopped crying. Its mother held it against her chest, her face turned away from me, her body angled to place itself between the child and whatever I was.

I was the thing that had made thirty people disappear.

I was the thing that could make anyone disappear.

I was the thing that reality rearranged itself to accommodate.

"Yun," Xu Ran said. "Now."

We left. The fox-spirit first, then me, then Xu Ran. The order was unplanned — instinctive. The animal leading, the anomaly following, the human guarding the rear. We walked out of the village the way you walk out of a room where something has broken — quickly, without looking back, without checking whether the pieces could be reassembled.

Behind us, the fires burned.

The water from the well would taste bitter for a week. Not because of contamination, not because of any physical or chemical process that could be identified and corrected. Because the world was adjusting. Pushing back. The subtle, cumulative cost of reality being edited by someone who hadn't asked reality's permission.

Luck Debt.

The phrase surfaced from memory — the quiet, incremental tax that the world levied on unauthorized changes. Every edit had a price. Every revision met resistance. The price was never dramatic, never immediate, never proportionate. It was always small and always late and always just enough to remind you that the world had opinions about being changed.

Bitter water. A fire that wouldn't die. The taste of metal in a woman's well.

I'd saved them. And they would never forgive me for it.
