# Chapter 29

The next day. Again.

I sat in the same place — the specific geographical consistency that Xu Ran had suggested, the rationale being that variable reduction improved diagnosis, that if the location was constant then any change in result could be attributed to the process rather than the position. Scientific thinking applied to something that wasn't science. His specialty.

I am mortal.

Stronger this time. Not louder — volume was irrelevant in the interior, where sound was metaphor and force was intention. Stronger in the sense of more committed, more deliberate, the specific increased investment of a woman who had failed yesterday and was applying yesterday's failure as today's instruction.

I am mortal. I AM mortal. I am MORTAL.

The emphasis shifted like weight on a scale, the stress moving from word to word, testing each syllable's load-bearing capacity, searching for the specific arrangement that would penetrate the wall.

Something.

Not breakthrough — the word was too large, too dramatic, too architecturally definitive for what actually occurred. A sound. Behind the wall. The specific auditory impression of a noise heard through insulation — muffled, indistinct, present but not clear. An echo. The acoustic evidence of space beyond the barrier, the proof that the wall had a far side and the far side contained something.

I opened my eyes. The clearing was unchanged. The stream ran. The birds were silent — had they been silent before? I couldn't remember. The specific uncertainty of a woman whose attention had been interior and whose exterior observations were therefore unreliable.

"Something," I said.

Xu Ran's brush was moving before I finished the word. He'd been watching — the specific sustained observation of a diagnostician monitoring for symptom change, the visual equivalent of a stethoscope pressed to the patient's surface.

"Describe it," he said.

"An echo. Behind — behind everything. Like a sound on the other side of something thick."

"Duration?"

"Brief. Half a breath."

He wrote. The characters were small, precise, the specific calligraphic density of data collection. He noted the duration. He noted the conditions. He noted the time of day, the position of my body, the expression on my face during the attempt.

"Environment?" he asked.

I looked. The clearing. The stream. The grass. The — had the leaves moved? The leaves on the tree nearest my position were — still. Not wind-still, not calm-still, but the specific frozen stillness of objects arrested mid-motion. As though the air around them had thickened for a fraction of the duration of my attempt and the leaves had been caught in the thickening.

"Minimal," I said. "Maybe. The leaves."

He looked. He noted.

"Again?" he said.

"Not today."

The exhaustion was different from the external-warping exhaustion. That had been physical — the specific muscular depletion of a body expending energy on something that shouldn't require energy. This was — deeper. Not bone-deep but identity-deep. The specific fatigue of a self that had been asked to look at itself and had found the looking more expensive than the doing.

We ate. Rice. The specific default meal that characterized our travel — the culinary baseline beneath which Xu Ran's cooking could not descend and above which it could not rise. I ate mechanically. The jaw worked. The tongue positioned. The body performed its feeding function without the mind's active participation.

"What does an echo mean?" I asked.

"Sound," he said. "The wall isn't solid."

"It felt solid."

"Sound passed through it. Solid doesn't transmit sound."

The logic was — reasonable. If the wall had been truly impenetrable, truly absolute, truly the total barrier that it had felt like, then nothing should have penetrated. Nothing should have echoed. The echo was evidence of imperfection — a crack, a thin spot, a vulnerability in the architecture that the architecture's designer hadn't intended.

I was the architecture's designer.

The fact was recursive and exhausting: I had built the wall, I was the wall, I was trying to breach the wall, and the wall's weakness was my weakness, and my weakness was the tool I needed to use to exploit the wall's weakness, and the circularity of the whole structure was the specific kind of logical topology that made the mind tired just from tracing it.

"Symptom," Xu Ran said. He was writing again. "Diagnosis. Treatment." He paused. Looked at me. "Same as any healer. Except the patient and the disease are the same thing."

"Is that supposed to help?"

"It's supposed to structure. Help comes later."

The afternoon arrived. The sun moved. The clouds — mine? not mine? — drifted. The specific atmospheric indifference of a sky that had no opinion about the struggle taking place beneath it.

I washed the bowls. The mechanical domesticity of post-meal cleanup — the specific human procedure that anchored the extraordinary in the ordinary, that placed the impossible task of self-transformation in the context of dirty dishes and cold stream water.

Tomorrow I would try again. The echo would be there or it wouldn't. The wall would crack or it wouldn't. The self would budge or it wouldn't.

But something had passed through. Something had echoed.

The wall wasn't solid.

That was — something.
