# Chapter 60

The rice burns.

She stands at the stove and watches the pot and the rice at the bottom of the pot is brown becoming dark becoming the charcoal shade that indicates the transition from cooking to cremation. The smell is — familiar. Not from her own cooking. From his.

Xu Ran.

The burned rice. HIS burned rice. The mediocre consistency that she endured for months of mountain walking, that she complained about and ate and complained about again. The rice that was reliably, dependably, consistently burned. Not because he couldn't cook — he could, he demonstrated that once, at the end, the one meal that proved he'd been choosing not to — but because the burning was his default, his baseline, the culinary expression of a man who knew the process but not the patience.

She has made his mistake.

The realization arrives with the rice. She has done exactly what he did — the water ratio wrong, the heat too high, the parametric error that produces burned-bottom-adequate-top, the geological stratification of overcooked and underdone in the same pot.

She eats it. Standing. The burned part is crunchy. The adequate part is — adequate. The overall experience is mediocre and fills the stomach and produces the satisfaction of a meal consumed regardless of quality.

She eats Xu Ran's rice and the eating is an echo and the echo is — not painful.

That is new. The echo is not painful. The memory of the man who burned rice is not the kind of memory that produces grief or loss or the emotional weight that memories of departed people usually carry. The memory is — warm. The particular warmth of a thing remembered with the fondness that time produces when time is allowed to work on memories the way time works on everything.

She sets the bowl down. The bowl is empty. The pot is burnt.

She cleans the pot. The abrasive procedure of removing burned rice from metal, the physical effort of scrubbing carbon from iron, the domestic labor that follows culinary failure. The sound — scrape, scrape, scrape — is rhythmic and meditative and produces the mental state that repetitive physical tasks provide, the thinking-without-thinking that the body performs when the body is occupied and the mind is free.

She thinks about collecting.

Not objects. Memories. The conscious decision to notice and retain instead of the unconscious accumulation that has characterized her memory for millennia. Before, memories happened TO her. Arrived without consent. Accumulated like sediment. Now — she CHOOSES. Looks at a moment and decides: this one. This one I keep.

The light through the kitchen window at this time of day — the angle, the color, the way it falls on the counter and illuminates the dust and the grain and the small imperfections of the surface. This one.

The sound of the Counter's voice from the lane — distant, counting, the numerical narration of a child who treats the world as a math problem and solves it constantly. This one.

The smell of the plum tree's blossoms in spring — the particular sweet-light scent that the flowers produce for the brief weeks of their display, the olfactory evidence of a season performing its function. This one.

Collecting. Not hoarding — collecting. The intentional curation of a life's moments, the conscious decision to VALUE the moments as they occur rather than discovering them later in the archive and wondering when they happened.

She cooks dinner. Better than the rice. The improvement that practice provides — bean stew, seasoned with the ginger that grows at the edge of the garden, flavored with the herbal note that ginger provides when ginger is used in the correct proportion. The stew is — acceptable. Genuinely acceptable. Not mediocre. Not bad. The quality level that represents actual competence rather than the absence of failure.

She eats. At the table. Sitting. The candle is lit. The stew is warm. The evening is arriving with the patience that mountain evenings display.

The fox-spirit is under the table. The position of an animal hoping for falling food, the optimistic proximity of a creature that has learned that human meals sometimes produce floor-level dividends.

She does not drop anything.

Loneliness is — different now. Not absent. Not gone. The quality of being alone has shifted from the loneliness of a woman who cannot connect (because she is too different, too old, too permanent) to the loneliness of a woman who is BETWEEN connections. The space between. Not emptiness but interval. Not void but pause. The architectural opening that lets the air through and lets the light through and is not nothing but is the thing that makes the walls meaningful.

She sits at the table. Alone. In the quiet house. The candle burns. The stew cools.

She is alone the way a room is empty — not bereft, but available.

This, she thinks. This one, too.

She collects the moment and adds it to the others.
