# Chapter 8

The sun began to set, and I discovered that I had been walking in circles.

Not literally — the path had moved forward, downhill, through a section of forest where the trees grew close enough that their canopies wove together into a single unbroken ceiling. But I had been here before. This morning, a week ago, or a century ago. The geography of forests stopped mattering after the first few thousand years. You saw one beech, you saw them all. The beeches might have disagreed, but nobody asked them.

The light changed — gold first, then copper, then the deep amber that preceded grey. Somewhere in the canopy, the day shift ended: songbirds winding down their final phrases, passing the silence to the crickets and the owl that lived in the dead oak a quarter-mile north. I had been hearing that owl for three years. Before it, there had been another owl. Before that, another. The tree remained. The owls were temporary.

Everything was temporary.

Behind me, footsteps.

He had been following for the better part of an hour. Quietly, for once — or his version of quietly, which meant reducing the twig-snapping from one per three steps to one per seven. An improvement. He had said nothing since "are you okay," which was either sensitivity or exhaustion. Knowing him — and I did not know him, refused to know him, knowing was a doorway I kept shut — it was probably both.

I reached a fork in the path. The left branch led toward the village, descending through undergrowth that thinned as the forest gave way to fields. The right branch went deeper, into old growth where the trees were thick enough to block the evening sky and the only sounds belonged to things that didn't sleep at night.

I took the right.

The path narrowed. Roots crossed it like tendons under skin, and the evening light struggled to reach the ground, filtered through so many layers of leaves that what arrived was more suggestion than illumination. The air cooled. Somewhere, water dripped — not a creek, just condensation finding its way from canopy to soil in the slow, patient rhythm of a forest breathing out.

His footsteps followed. Ten paces behind. The distance had been consistent for the last half-hour — close enough to track me, far enough to retreat if I turned around. A negotiated distance. A treaty neither of us had discussed.

He wasn't talking.

That was different. The boy had talked through every other moment we'd shared — talked through fear, through wonder, through the afterimage of a beast dying two meters from his face. His silence now was not the silence of someone with nothing to say. It was the silence of someone who understood, in the wordless way that children sometimes understood things, that this moment required a different currency.

We walked.

The forest closed around us. The path, such as it was, dissolved into a deer track that wound between trunks older than most civilizations I'd watched rise and fall. Moss covered everything — green so deep it looked black in the dying light, soft enough to swallow footfalls. Even his footsteps quieted. The forest was doing the work for him, cushioning his noise, absorbing his presence into its own.

A branch hung low across the path. A thick one — oak, heavy with lichen, angled downward by the weight of its own growth. It hung at a height that would hit my chest but would catch him square in the face.

I reached up.

Pushed the branch aside.

Held it.

The motion was small. My fingers against the bark, the branch's weight resisting and then yielding. I held it for one second. Two. Enough time for him to pass underneath without breaking stride. Enough time for the branch to remember being held.

I didn't think about it. That was the point — there was no decision, no calculation, no weighing of whether this child deserved the courtesy of an unobstructed path. My hand moved the way hands move when the body knows something the mind hasn't approved. Reflex. Habit. Or something older than either.

He ducked under the branch. I let it go. It swung back into place, rustling, and was still.

Neither of us mentioned it.

The sky above the canopy was purple now, darkening toward the particular shade of blue that existed for ten minutes each evening and never repeated exactly. The first star appeared — or the first one I bothered to notice. Stars were another thing I'd stopped counting.

I walked.

He followed.

Ten paces. The evening sounds. The moss. The dark.

At some point, he would turn back. The novelty would fade, the gratitude would find its limits, and he would return to his village and his father and his poisonous mushrooms and his life, and I would continue in the direction I had always been going, which was no direction at all.

The forest grew darker. The path disappeared entirely, replaced by the soft uncertainty of ground that humans didn't walk on. My feet found their way without light — they always had, since before light was something I needed.

Behind me, ten paces back, the boy's breathing steadied. Calmed. Matched itself, without trying, to the rhythm of my steps.

He didn't turn back.

I didn't stop.
