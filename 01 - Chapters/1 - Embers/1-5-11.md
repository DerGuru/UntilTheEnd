# Chapter 42

The village slept.

Not peacefully — the word implies a condition the village hadn't achieved in weeks. It slept the way exhausted things sleep: deeply, gratefully, without the luxury of choosing comfort over collapse. The cooking fires had burned out. The last conversations had trailed off into the particular silence of people who had said everything useful and lacked the energy for what wasn't. The windows were dark. The doors were closed. The night had the village to itself.

I was on the hilltop.

My hilltop. The one with the flat stone and the view and the grass that remembered my shape. The wind was warm — still warm, always warm, the drought's insistence on consistency extending to the air itself. It carried dust. It always carried dust now. The valley was drying at the cellular level, the soil releasing its last moisture into a sky that accepted it without acknowledgment.

Above me, the stars.

I'd been watching them for — I stopped counting millennia ago, but the habit persisted, the way habits from the first century of life persist long after their purpose has dissolved. The constellations were different now. Not dramatically — not rearranged — but shifted. Stellar drift, the slow migration of bodies across distances so vast that the movement was imperceptible on any human timescale. On mine, it was a calendar. Stars that had been fixed points in my early years had migrated, dimmed, vanished. New ones had appeared — young, bright, burning with the particular intensity of objects that hadn't yet learned that intensity was finite.

I'd watched stars die. Slowly, across centuries. A gradual dimming, a reddening, a fading to nothing. The death of a star was less dramatic than the death of a sandstone library or a rooftop garden or a child holding a burned scroll. But it lasted longer. And no one wept for it.

The horizon pulsed.

Xu Ran. His qi-signature had settled into a final rhythm — dense, compressed, regular. The consolidation was nearly complete. The energy he'd gathered from the spirit beast cores, from the environment, from the valley itself, was coiling inward, tightening, preparing for the expansion that would come when the structure reached its limit and the boundary between what he was and what he was becoming dissolved.

Five days.

The math was simple. Radius: seven li, possibly eight. The village: three li from his position. Inside the zone. My barriers would reduce the impact — the redirected qi-flows, the stone walls, the trenches would absorb and deflect perhaps forty percent of the shockwave. The remaining sixty percent would arrive at the village as a sustained pressure wave lasting anywhere from minutes to hours.

Effects: contamination of remaining water sources. Destruction of root vegetable crop. Structural damage to weakened buildings. Qi-shock in unprotected humans — nausea, disorientation, temporary blindness in sensitive individuals.

Deaths: unlikely. Injuries: probable. Habitability after: marginal.

The village would survive the breakthrough. It would not survive the winter that followed.

I could leave.

The thought arrived with its old familiarity — comfortable, worn, the mental equivalent of a coat I'd been putting on and taking off for four thousand years. I could leave. Walk down the hill, cross the valley, follow the river south until the pulsing faded and the air cleared and the village became another place I'd been. Another valley. Another collection of warm lights in the dark, growing smaller with distance, growing easier to forget with each step.

I could leave. I'd done it before. Hundreds of times. The mechanics were simple: stand up, walk, don't turn around. The simplicity was the appeal — leaving was the only action that required no engagement, no decision, no reckoning with the consequences of having been present. You couldn't fail at leaving. You could only succeed.

I could leave.

The thought sat in my chest. I held it there, examining it with the care of someone inspecting an artifact that used to be functional and now was merely historical. It still fit. It still had its old weight, its old logic, its old promise of unburdened existence. But it didn't — quite — produce the old certainty. The guarantee that leaving was correct, that non-involvement was neutral, that walking away from something was different from walking toward nothing.

The congee. The fire. The arm. The boy's breathing in the dark, third-step rhythm, trusting that the world would still be here when he woke up. The almost-laugh. The not-smile. The rooster, spiraling into the gap between houses with the tactical awareness of a small, angry general.

The boy asking the fire what I was, because the fire was safer to ask than me.

"Old," I'd said. And he'd thanked me for it.

I could leave.

I stood up. The grass released my shape reluctantly — the impression stayed, a negative of my body, an absence with boundaries. The wind pushed at me from the east, carrying Xu Ran's qi and the dust and the smell of a valley that was dying slowly and would die faster soon.

I didn't leave.

I didn't leave because leaving was the one thing I'd always been good at, and I was tired of being good at it. I didn't leave because a boy with dirt on his face had said "words are something" and meant it. I didn't leave because Mrs. Liu was planting root vegetables in cracked earth and Mrs. Zhao's rooster was plotting its next escape and Elder Li was chewing his cheek and the village was surviving, stubbornly, impossibly, in the face of forces it couldn't see and couldn't fight and couldn't understand.

I didn't leave because five days from now, something was going to happen, and the barriers weren't going to be enough, and I was going to have to choose between the woman I'd been for four thousand years and the woman who drank congee and replaced roof tiles and chased roosters and almost laughed when a twelve-year-old boy told her she was in a bad mood.

I stood on the hilltop. The stars turned overhead — slowly, imperceptibly, the ancient machinery of the universe grinding through its cycles without urgency or awareness or the slightest interest in the decisions of a woman standing on a hill.

Five days.

The wind blew.

I did not leave.
