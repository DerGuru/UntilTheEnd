# Chapter 24

Wei fell asleep by the fire.

It happened the way sleep takes children — suddenly, treacherously, in the middle of a sentence that lost its verb and then its subject and then its speaker. He'd been talking about something. The market, or the fish, or the way Old Lan's goat had eaten through Chen's fence again. The words thinned, the pauses lengthened, and then he was gone — tipped sideways against the stone he'd been sitting against, legs drawn up, arms folded across his chest, head resting on nothing in particular.

Twelve years old. Asleep, he looked younger. The sharpness left his face — the set jaw, the calculating eyes, the stubborn architecture of a boy who had decided that the world was a problem he could solve through persistence. What remained was softer. The curve of his cheek, the slight parting of his lips, the eyelashes that cast shadows in the firelight. A child's face. The face of someone who still fit inside the shape their body made when they curled up, because the world hadn't yet expanded them past their margins.

His breathing was slow. Regular. The deep, undefended rhythm of a body that trusted its environment enough to turn off its alarms. This, more than anything else — more than his stubbornness, his intelligence, his talent for following women who did not want to be followed — was the thing I couldn't understand. He slept here. In the open. Next to a fire that would die before dawn, in a forest that was emptying of everything warm-blooded, within range of a cultivator whose power could level a valley.

And he slept.

The moon was a sickle. Thin, sharp, casting the kind of light that made shadows deeper than the dark it was supposed to relieve. The crickets sang — fewer than last week, the depletion thinning even the insects. Somewhere far away, to the northwest, the pulse of Xu Ran's cultivation beat against the edge of my awareness like a second heart. Steady. Greedy. Closer than yesterday.

The fire crackled. A log collapsed into embers, sending a brief shower of sparks upward. One landed on Wei's sleeve. I watched it die — a bright point, dimming, joining the fabric without harm. His sleeve was already spotted with small burns from previous fires. Evidence of a life lived next to heat, because warmth had to be earned and earning it left marks.

Not my problem.

The thought was clear. Familiar. I had thought it so many times that it had worn a groove in my consciousness, a path that my mind followed with the effortless ease of water following a riverbed. Not my problem. The boy, the village, the father with the rotting lungs, the cultivator eating the forest from the inside out — none of it was my problem. I had no stake. I had no obligation. I had no connection to this place, this time, these people, that could not be severed by the simple act of walking in any direction and not stopping.

I had done it before. Millions of times. Cities, villages, forests, civilizations — I had watched them rise and wither and forgotten them before the dust settled. That was what immortality was: the ability to be present for everything and responsible for nothing. A spectator's existence. Clean. Efficient. Unburdened.

Not my problem.

The boy shivered.

Not violently — a small tremor, the body's reflexive protest against the cooling air. The fire was dying. The embers glowed orange, still warm but diminishing. In an hour, they would be ash. In two, the cold would settle properly, and a twelve-year-old sleeping on the ground in a thinning forest would feel it in his joints and his fingers and the space between his shoulder blades where the warmth left first.

I didn't need warmth. Temperature had stopped being relevant to my experience sometime around the fall of the Third Dynasty — whichever third dynasty that was, there had been several. My body processed heat and cold with the same indifference it processed light and sound and the gravitational pull of celestial bodies. I wore clothes because nudity attracted attention, not because I needed protection from the elements.

The jacket I wore — a simple thing, dark fabric, worn soft by centuries of use (or a replica of something worn soft by centuries of use; I replaced them when they fell apart, and they fell apart often, because fabric was temporary and I was not) — sat on my shoulders with the weight of something I didn't need.

I stood up.

Walked to where he lay.

Took the jacket off.

Laid it over him.

The motion took three seconds. Less. My hands settled the fabric over his shoulders, tucked the edge under his chin — not tight, not fussed over, just placed. The way you place a thing that matters on a surface that matters, with the specific care that is indistinguishable from carelessness unless you know what to look for.

He didn't wake. His breathing didn't change. He just — was warmer. The shivering stopped.

I turned my back. Walked into the dark.

I did not think about what I had done. There was nothing to think about. It was a jacket. It was cold. He was a child. The action had no significance beyond the thermal. It was physics. Heat transfer. Conservation of energy. Generosity had nothing to do with it. Care had nothing to do with it.

Not my problem.

The words repeated. Clear, final, carved into the architecture of my self-narrative with the precision of a mason setting a cornerstone. Not my problem. Not my village. Not my student. Not my fight.

The dark closed around me. The forest was quiet — the wrong kind of quiet, the depleted kind, the kind that meant something was eating the world from one end and hadn't finished yet. My footsteps made no sound on the moss. My breathing didn't disturb the air. I was a ghost's ghost — present without evidence, warm without source, moving without destination.

Behind me, the fire's last embers turned from orange to grey.

Behind me, a boy slept under a jacket he hadn't asked for, given by a woman who would deny it happened if the question were ever asked.

Not my problem.

The words were clear. They were final. They were, for the first time in four thousand years, unconvincing.
