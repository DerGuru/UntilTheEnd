# Chapter 43

The well went dry on the fourth day.

Not the slow decline we'd been managing — not cloudy becoming yellow becoming metallic. This was cessation. Mrs. Liu lowered the bucket, hauled it up, and it came back empty. She lowered it again. Empty. A third time, because Mrs. Liu treated reality as a negotiation rather than a fact.

Empty.

She set the bucket down on the stone rim, wiped her hands on her apron, and turned to Elder Li with a face that said everything her mouth didn't. Li chewed his cheek. The habit had progressed to the point where I could see a raw spot forming on the inside, a small wound he was maintaining through sheer repetitive anxiety.

The village gathered. Not by announcement — by gravity. Bad news in a small community pulls people toward its center the way qi-drainage pulls energy toward a siphon. Within an hour, every adult was in the square, and the square was doing what squares do when the water runs out: producing noise at a volume inversely proportional to its usefulness.

"We should move."

Gao. His face had the drawn quality of a man who'd been losing arguments with the river for weeks and had transferred his frustration to the village as a whole. His nets were folded and stacked near his door — a gesture of surrender so tidy it bordered on defiance.

"Move where?" Mrs. Liu crossed her arms. "The next village is two days' walk. With children. In this heat. Without water."

"We have water from the stream—"

"Enough for here. Not enough for walking."

"Then we dig deeper—"

"Dig with what? Your hands?"

The argument circled. It had the familiar topology of disputes that are fundamentally about fear rather than logistics — people saying "we should" when they meant "I'm afraid," people saying "we can't" when they meant "I don't know how."

Elder Li said nothing. He stood with his arms at his sides and his shoulders at an angle that suggested they were holding up something invisible and heavy, and he looked at the ground, and the ground looked back at him with cracks.

Wei stood up.

He'd been sitting on the flat stone at the square's edge — the one the children used as a bench, low enough for short legs, warm enough in afternoon sun. He'd been sitting and listening and doing the thing I'd drilled into him without knowing I was drilling it: observing before acting, collecting data before forming conclusions, waiting until the picture was complete and then — only then — moving.

He stood up. Walked to the center of the square. Stopped.

The adults looked at him. Some with the indulgent confusion of people encountering a child in an adult context. Some with irritation — this was not the time for children. Gao opened his mouth.

"We do this," Wei said.

His voice was too high. He knew it. I could see him fighting the pitch — pressing his diaphragm down, trying to find the register that would survive adult scrutiny. His chin trembled. Not visibly, not to anyone who wasn't watching for it, but I was watching for it, and the tremor was there: the physiological signature of a twelve-year-old body producing courage from a supply that wasn't designed for this much withdrawal.

"The well is gone. The stream isn't — not yet." He swallowed. Reset. "There's a spring on the western slope. Clean water. I've tasted it." He had. I'd sent him there three days ago to check my pathwork. "It's an hour's walk." He held up a finger. Then another, because he couldn't help himself. "Two people can carry enough for the village per trip. Three trips a day."

Gao: "An hour each way? In this heat?"

"In the morning. Before the sun is high. And at dusk. When it's cooler."

"And the food?"

"The root vegetables are still in the ground. They're not dead — they're slow." He looked down at his hands like the numbers lived there. "We cut rations. Half for grown-ups. Full for kids and elders. The dried fish lasts another two weeks if we—"

"Son." The Elder's voice. Quiet, tired, the voice of a man who'd spent decades being the person who spoke last and was tired of what he heard from everyone else. "How do you know all this?"

Wei looked at him. I watched the boy's face do something I hadn't seen before — an expression that wasn't borrowed from his mother's worry or his father's stubbornness or even from me. It was his. A look that said: *I paid attention.*

"I counted the fish. I measured the water. I walked the spring route. I looked at the vegetables."

"When?"

"While everyone was talking."

The silence that followed had a different texture than the earlier ones. Not the silence of shock or disagreement. The silence of recalculation. People looking at the boy in the center of their square and adjusting a category they'd assumed was fixed: *child.*

Elder Li looked at me. Briefly — a flick of the eyes, barely a glance. He knew. Not what I was, not the specifics, but the outline: the boy's competence didn't come from nowhere, and the woman at the forest's edge who'd taught him herbs and water filtration and the particular discipline of counting before speaking was part of a pattern Li was too tired and too old and too pragmatic to investigate.

Mrs. Liu saw the look. Her mouth tightened, then loosened again as if she'd decided the question could wait.

He looked back at Wei.

"The spring on the western slope. You're sure it's clean?"

"I drank from it three days ago. I'm still alive."

A sound. Not laughter — pre-laughter. The ghost of amusement that appears when fear meets something unexpected and doesn't know how to categorize it.

"Two volunteers for the water run," Li said. "Morning and evening. Chen, Gao — you're fit enough. Wei goes with you the first time. He knows the route."

Gao stared. His mouth moved. No sound came out.

"The rest of you — half rations as the boy said. We've survived worse."

He hadn't. None of them had. But it was the right thing to say, and he said it with the right amount of certainty, and certainty — even false certainty — is a resource that doesn't run out when the well does.
