# Chapter 9

He walked behind me until he didn't.

Somewhere past midnight — or wherever the forest's darkness was thickest and the moss deepest — his steps slowed. The ten-pace distance stretched to twelve, then fifteen, then to the particular rhythm of a body forgetting how to be vertical. I heard it happen: the stumble, the correction, the second stumble that was less a stumble than a negotiation with gravity. Then the soft, decisive sound of a twelve-year-old folding into the space between two roots, and the breathing that followed — deep, immediate, the sleep of someone who had been running on stubbornness and had run out.

I stopped.

Stood in the dark with a sleeping boy ten paces behind me and the forest doing what forests did at night: existing, indifferently, in every direction.

I could have left. The thought arrived, sat down, made itself comfortable. While he slept, while the distance between his breathing and my walking could grow into something permanent. The simplest exit. The kindest one, probably — he would wake in a forest he knew, find his way home, and I would be a strange woman who had once killed a spirit beast and then dissolved into the kind of memory that twelve-year-olds filed under "probably a dream."

I didn't leave.

I sat against a birch. Close enough that the forest's sounds would reach him as forest sounds and not as silence. Far enough that when he woke, the distance would look like coincidence.

He woke before dawn. Grey light, grey air, the hour when the night hasn't quite left and the morning hasn't fully committed. I heard him sit up. The confusion — three seconds of a body remembering where it was and why. Then footsteps, moving away. Toward the village. Toward the smoke that was beginning to rise from chimneys where the first fires were being lit.

He didn't say anything. I didn't look.

---

He came back.

Of course he did. I hoped — with the dull, impersonal hope of someone who has learned not to invest in outcomes — that the events of the previous day would have discouraged him. That the memory of a spirit beast dissolving two meters from his face would settle into something resembling common sense, and he would choose the option that involved staying far away from the woman who could disintegrate living things with her finger.

But he came back.

I was still against the birch. The air smelled of dew and cold grass and the distant woodsmoke from the village, where people who did not know they were temporary were starting their days. The birch was comfortable in the way that trees were comfortable after you stopped caring about comfort: it held still, it didn't ask questions, and it had been in roughly the same spot for ninety years.

Footsteps. The particular brand of footsteps that belonged to a boy who believed that moving quickly and moving quietly were the same thing. Leaves crunched. A branch snapped. Something small and probably innocent fled through the underbrush.

"There you are!"

He emerged from the tree line with his basket on his back and a grin that suggested he had won a bet with himself. His ankle was still wrapped, but he moved on it like the pain was a minor administrative inconvenience. Twelve years old. The age where the body forgave everything and the mind hadn't learned to hold grudges.

"I brought these." He swung the basket off his back and knelt in front of me, presenting its contents like an offering. Herbs. Roots. Mushrooms. All of them wrong.

I looked at the collection. Looked at him. Looked at the collection again.

"What?" he said.

I said nothing. He shrugged, sat down three paces away, and began sorting his findings into piles that followed a logic I couldn't identify and didn't want to.

That was day two.

Day three, he came later — mid-morning, when the sun had burned off the fog and the forest hummed with the business of insects. He had questions. Many questions. He wanted to know about spirit beasts: where they lived, what they ate, whether they slept, whether they could be tamed, whether the one I'd killed had a family.

"Do spirit beasts have families?"

I did not answer.

"Because if they do, there might be a baby boar out there. Right now. Looking for its mother. Which is dust." He paused. "You dusted its mother."

I stared at a point approximately three hundred years in the past. It was a comfortable distance.

"I think they do have families," he continued, answering his own question with the confidence of someone who had never met an obstacle that silence couldn't solve. "Old Chen says they're animals with qi, and animals have families. So there might be a Mrs. Boar. And little boars."

He was quiet for exactly four seconds.

"Do you think the little boars will come looking for revenge?"

"Those were badger tracks," I said.

He blinked. It took him a moment to connect this statement to the conversation from yesterday — or was it the day before? His sense of time was as disorganized as his herb collection. Then his face lit up.

"Ha! I *knew* you were listening yesterday! I said they were wolf tracks, and you—" He pointed at me with a reed he'd pulled from the ground. "You said *badger*. Under your breath. Like you didn't want me to hear."

I had not said it under my breath. I had said it at normal volume. He had simply been talking too loudly to notice.

Day four, the herbs improved. Not because he'd gained knowledge — he hadn't — but because he'd watched. Watched what I stepped around, what I glanced at, what I didn't touch. The boy was not talented. But he was observant in the desperate, focused way of someone whose survival depended on reading the world correctly. His new collection was still mostly wrong, but less catastrophically so. He'd stopped picking Blushing Caps. He'd started picking Silverleaf, which was useless but harmless — an improvement over poisonous.

He laid them out on a flat rock near where I sat. I did not look at them. He looked at me not looking at them. Something passed between us — not understanding, exactly, but the mutual acknowledgment that a game was being played, and that neither of us was going to admit to the rules.

Day five.

He sat down beside me. Closer than usual — two paces instead of three. His basket was on the ground. He wasn't sorting herbs. He wasn't talking. He was just sitting, legs crossed, hands on his knees, staring at the same trees I was staring at.

Five minutes passed. The forest did forest things: wind in the canopy, a bird calling for a mate it would never find, the patient creak of branches adjusting to the morning's warmth.

"Are you always like this?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Good. Then I know what to expect."

He picked up a pinecone. Turned it over in his hands. Set it down.

"My father's worse today. The cough. It's deeper."

I said nothing. The morning light fell through the canopy in sheets, illuminating the dust motes that drifted between us — small, golden, temporary.

"The herbs I'm bringing — they're not working, are they?"

The question sat between us like a stone dropped into still water. He wasn't looking at me. He was looking at the pinecone, turning it over and over, as if the answer might be written on one of its scales.

I watched the dust motes. They drifted in patterns that looked random but weren't — affected by air currents too subtle for human senses, by the heat of bodies, by the breath of trees.

"No," I said.

He nodded. Small. The motion of someone confirming what they already knew, and had known for weeks, and had continued to collect herbs anyway because the alternative was a stillness he couldn't afford.

He put the pinecone down. Stood up. Brushed off his pants.

"Same time tomorrow?"

He left before I could answer. Which was convenient, because I didn't have one.
