# Chapter 1

The forest smelled like rain that hadn't fallen yet.

I walked. That was what I did — walked. Through forests, across mountains, along rivers that had changed their courses three or four times since I'd first seen them. This one was old, for a forest. The trees were thick enough that two men couldn't have wrapped their arms around most of them, and the canopy was so dense that morning came late and left early. Moss draped the branches like funeral shrouds. Ferns unfurled from rotting stumps. The air was heavy, green, and wet.

It was beautiful. I knew that the way you know a fact you've read too many times — with your head, not with anything that matters.

Another day.

I stepped over a fallen trunk without looking down. My feet knew the ground better than my eyes did. A thousand forests, ten thousand — they all had the same bones underneath. Roots, rocks, the slow decay of things that used to stand. I could feel the qi in the soil, dim and sluggish, the pulse of a world that didn't know I was listening.

Birds called from somewhere above. A warbler, two sparrows arguing, something larger rustling through the upper branches. Insects hummed in the spaces between the trees, that low drone that filled the silence without breaking it. The sound of a forest that was alive, unremarkably, persistently alive.

I'd heard these sounds when the trees were saplings. Before that, when the land was scrub. Before that — but I didn't think about before that. Not on mornings like this. Not when the light came through the leaves in patterns I'd memorized centuries ago.

My feet were bare. The moss was cool and damp. Dew clung to the fern tips and occasionally one would brush my ankle, leaving a cold streak on my skin. I used to notice things like that. The temperature of water. The texture of bark under my fingers. There was a time when every sensation was a small discovery.

That time was very far away.

I passed a spirit beast den — empty, recently abandoned. The scratches on the entrance log were fresh, the dirt still damp where something large had dragged itself out. Low-level. Tier one, maybe two. The kind of beast that would terrify a village and bore a proper cultivator. I noted it the way you note a crack in the road: something that existed, that I would step around.

The air shifted. Warmer, suddenly, as if the forest had taken a breath. A cloud must have moved — sunlight broke through the canopy and hit the ground in a column of gold, illuminating the motes of dust and pollen that drifted through the air like tiny, purposeless travelers.

I stopped without meaning to.

The light was warm on my face. I closed my eyes.

For a moment — half a moment, maybe less — I let it sit there. The warmth. The quiet. The smell of moss and wet wood and the faint sweetness of something flowering nearby that I could have named if I'd cared to.

Then I opened my eyes and kept walking.

That was the habit. Brief pauses, not because I felt something, but because my body remembered feeling things and occasionally went through the motions without consulting me. Muscle memory of a person I used to be. I'd stopped minding. It happened less often now than it used to.

The morning light caught on a spiderweb strung between two branches — each droplet of dew a tiny, perfect lens. I'd seen something like it before, once, on a mountain that no longer existed. The web had been bigger then. Or maybe I was remembering it wrong. Memory did that after a few thousand years. The details softened, the edges blurred, until what remained was less a recollection than a feeling wearing the costume of one.

I hadn't eaten in — how long? I counted backwards. A month? Three? The body didn't need it. Hadn't needed it for so long that the act of eating felt like a performance, a pantomime of humanity. I could eat. I remembered how. I remembered enjoying it, distantly, the way you remember the plot of a story someone told you once at a party.

My Qi was still, perfectly masked. That took no effort — hadn't for millennia. Like breathing, like blinking. The ocean pretending to be a puddle. Anything in this forest with the sense to feel for energy signatures would register me as nothing. A mortal woman walking through the trees. Unremarkable. Forgettable.

That was the point.

I followed no path. There wasn't one, not really — just the gaps between the trees that were wide enough to walk through without turning sideways. The forest floor dropped slightly, following the slope of a hill I'd watched erode over the centuries. At the bottom, a stream — thin, clear, gurgling over stones that had been sharp once and were smooth now. I stepped across it without breaking stride.

Something caught at the edge of my awareness.

A qi signature — low, animal, pulsing with hunger. Spirit beast. Close. Maybe three hundred paces north, moving south through the undergrowth. Its energy was ragged, agitated. Hunting, or fleeing from something that hunted it. The feel of it was coarse, like rough-cut stone — no refinement, no cultivation, just raw power compressed into muscle and bone and instinct.

I logged it and kept walking. Spirit beasts were common enough in forests like this. The qi concentration in the soil attracted them. They fed, grew, sometimes evolved. Sometimes they wandered into the lowlands and destroyed a village. Sometimes a cultivator came and destroyed them first. The cycle was old and unremarkable. I'd seen it turn a thousand times.

Then I felt the second signal.

Small. Human. Faint. The qi signature of someone who had never cultivated a day in their life — just the dim, natural glow of a living body. A child, probably. Young. Moving through the forest maybe a hundred and fifty paces east of my position, perpendicular to the beast's trajectory.

I stopped.

The beast was heading south. The human was heading west. Their paths would intersect in — I calculated without thinking, the way I calculated everything without thinking — sixty heartbeats. Maybe seventy, if the child was slow. Which children usually were.

I stood very still and listened to the forest breathe around me.

I used to sigh in moments like this. I'd trained myself out of it centuries ago. Sighing implied investment. Investment implied caring. Caring implied—

Well.

I didn't sigh. I just stood there, between the trees, and waited to see what would happen.

The way I always did.
