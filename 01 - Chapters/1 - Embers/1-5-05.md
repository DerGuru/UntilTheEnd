# Chapter 36

The drought deepened.

Nine days without rain became twelve. Twelve became sixteen. The sky held its blue like a promise it had no intention of keeping, and the sun arrived each morning with the dedicated cruelty of something that didn't know it was cruel — which, I'd learned over the centuries, was the most effective kind.

The village adapted. That was the word for it — adapted — though it carried a clinical neutrality that failed to capture the reality. The reality was: they worked harder. They woke earlier. They dug channels in cracked earth with tools that were older than most of their owners and ate less so the stores would last and carried water in buckets from the stream because the well now produced something closer to rust than water.

Elder Li lost weight. His face thinned in the way that old faces do when calories become arithmetic — the cheekbones emerging, the eyes settling deeper, the skin loosening as though the body beneath it was retreating inward. He didn't complain. None of them complained. Complaining required energy, and energy was currency, and currency was not spent on words when it could be spent on work.

Mrs. Liu's root vegetables went in on the fourth day. She directed the planting with the efficiency of a woman who had done this before and expected to do it again and resented the necessity without being paralyzed by the resentment. The children helped — small hands in dry soil, pushing seeds into cracks, carrying water one cup at a time from the filtered barrels. Xiao Mei, the girl with the goat stories, sang while she planted. The same song her mother sang at night — badly, beautifully. The melody was simpler in a child's voice. More honest.

I checked the barriers daily. The qi-flow was holding its new course — south, toward the river, away from the village. The stone walls were stable. The trenches were intact. I reinforced two sections where erosion had weakened the channel walls, packing clay into the gaps with hands that had healed from the blisters and were now simply dirty.

Wei trained.

Every morning, without being asked, without being reminded, he walked to the barrier course and ran it. Wall to wall, trench to trench, the third-step pattern steady beneath feet that were getting harder and more certain with each repetition. His balance had shifted — not just physically but in the way he occupied space, the way his weight distributed when he stood still. He was beginning to understand that stillness and stability were not the same thing. Stillness was the absence of motion. Stability was the presence of control.

He fell less. When he fell, he fell better — controlled, directed, turning a collapse into a roll and a roll into a recovery. I corrected less frequently. Not because the errors disappeared, but because they shrank from mistakes into preferences, and preferences were a student's territory, not a teacher's.

"Your right foot is still—"

"Better than last week."

"Better is not correct."

"Better is what I've got."

I let it stand. He was right, in his way. Better was what he had. It was what all of them had — the village, the Elder, Mrs. Liu, the children planting root vegetables in drought-cracked earth. Not good. Not fixed. Not saved. But better than yesterday, and better was enough to build on.

The fish stopped coming on the eighteenth day. Fischer Gao sat by the riverbank with his nets spread out beside him, the mesh clean and mended and entirely pointless, and stared at the water as though it owed him something. It did, in a way. The river had been reliable for three generations. Its betrayal — if you could call the physics of qi-drainage a betrayal — was personal in the way that only impersonal forces can be.

"Could be worse," Gao said when I passed him.

"How?"

He thought about it. "Could be winter."

That was fair. Drought in summer was survivable — miserable, damaging, but survivable. Drought in winter, when cold multiplied every deprivation, when a missing harvest meant empty bellies in freezing air, when the old and the young died first because the margin between survival and failure narrowed to a knife's edge—

"Could be winter," I agreed.

Wei had started helping the village without being asked. He carried water. He dug channels. He moved stones for the older men whose backs protested what their hands were willing to do. He didn't announce his contributions or seek acknowledgment — he simply appeared wherever labor was needed and worked until the labor was done and then moved on to the next task.

His mother watched him. I saw her face when he came home — the careful, precise monitoring of a woman cataloging her son's transformation without quite understanding what was transforming or why. He was different. Harder, in places. Steadier. He moved with a certainty that twelve-year-olds shouldn't have and that this particular twelve-year-old had earned through repetition and bruises and the patient, unglamorous process of becoming competent at something difficult.

She brought me tea once. Left it on the flat stone near the fire pit without speaking, without making eye contact, without the formality that would have turned it into a social transaction. The tea was weak — rationed leaves, stretched thin — and sweet in a way that suggested she'd added honey from a supply that was probably running low.

I drank it. It was better than congee.

The horizon pulsed. Xu Ran — still consolidating, still pulling, still cycling toward the moment when the pressure would equalize and the breakthrough would come. But something had changed. The rhythm was faster. The intervals shorter.

Not two weeks.

Ten days. Maybe eight.

I didn't tell the village. The village didn't need a countdown — it needed root vegetables and filtered water and the daily, cumulative refusal to be destroyed by something it couldn't see and didn't understand.

I checked the barriers one more time. Reinforced the western trench. Adjusted two stones on the upper wall.

Then I sat by the fire, and I drank the tea, and I watched the stars come out, and I did not calculate the odds because the odds were not helpful and the tea was warm and the boy was asleep and the village was surviving, stubbornly, relentlessly, in the way that small things survive large forces: by being too persistent to die.
