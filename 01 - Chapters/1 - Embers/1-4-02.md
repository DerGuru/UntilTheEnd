# Chapter 26

I came in the night.

The village slept the way villages sleep during hard times — lightly, uneasily, with one ear turned toward the forest and the other toward the crying of children who'd absorbed their parents' anxiety through the porous membrane of walls too thin to keep anything out. A dog whimpered somewhere. A shutter creaked in a wind that wasn't there.

Wei's house was dark. His mother had fallen asleep in the chair by the pallet — her head tipped forward, chin on her chest, hands still folded in her lap as if she'd been praying and lost the argument with exhaustion mid-sentence. Wei lay on the pallet, his splinted arm elevated on a folded blanket, his face turned toward the ceiling. His eyes were open.

The door didn't creak when I entered. Or it did, and neither of us acknowledged it.

"You," he said.

"Quiet."

He closed his mouth. His eyes tracked me across the room — wide, alert, sharpened by pain into a focus that his training hadn't yet achieved on its own. Sweat glistened on his forehead. The splint smelled of camphor and desperation. His skin was hot — the low-grade fever of a body fighting inflammation with the only tools it had.

I knelt beside the pallet.

His arm lay between us on the blanket — swollen, purple-black at the joint, the splint holding the bones in approximately the right alignment. Approximately was the best a village healer could do. Approximately wasn't enough.

I placed my hand over the break.

The contact was light — my palm against the wrapping, fingers curving around the forearm without pressure. My skin was cool. It was always cool. Temperature was a function of metabolism, and my metabolism had transcended function somewhere around the era when function was invented.

"What are you—"

"*Quiet.*"

He went quiet.

I closed my eyes. Not because I needed to — sight was no more essential to this than breathing was — but because closing my eyes narrowed the world to touch and frequency, and what I was about to do required precision at a scale that made surgery look like carpentry.

I released qi.

A thread. Less than a thread — a filament, thinner than a spider's silk, carrying just enough energy to persuade bone fragments that they had never separated. I guided it through the wrapping, through the swelling, into the fracture zone where three pieces of ulna sat in positions that nature had not intended and the village healer had done his best to approximate.

The fragments moved.

Wei's jaw clenched. His back arched — involuntarily, the body's protest against being rearranged from the inside. The sensation would not be pleasant: a deep, grinding pull, accompanied by a warmth that started at the bone and radiated outward through the soft tissue. Not pain exactly — or not only pain. The feeling of something returning to a position it remembered, the way a dislocated joint remembers its socket.

The first fragment aligned. I held it. Fused the fracture line with a pulse of qi so precise that the bone's crystalline structure reformed along its original grain, stronger than before, because my qi didn't do half measures even when I asked it to.

The second fragment. Smaller, more displaced, lodged in soft tissue that had already begun to swell around it like a river rerouting around a stone. I moved it. The tissue protested. I persuaded it. The fragment slid home.

The third. The joint itself — the damaged articulation surface, cartilage torn, ligaments stretched past their elastic limit. This took longer. Cartilage was slower to rebuild than bone; it required coaxing rather than commanding, and coaxing with qi was like trying to whisper through a hurricane. I reduced my output to almost nothing. A breath of energy. A suggestion.

The joint reformed.

Three minutes. Four. Under my hand, the swelling receded — not vanishing, but redistributing, the excess fluid being absorbed back into the tissue at a rate that the healer would have called miraculous and I would have called adequate. The bruising faded from purple-black to yellow-green in the time it took Wei to breathe twice.

The air *flimmered*.

Not a word I would have chosen — but the closest approximation available in a language that wasn't designed to describe what happened. For one second — one heartbeat, one blink, one fraction of a moment too brief to measure and too strange to dismiss — the world *shifted*. The walls of the hut, the moonlight through the window, Wei's face, my own hand against his arm — all of it *stuttered*, as if reality had briefly forgotten how to render itself and was consulting the instructions.

For that heartbeat, everything looked — written. Not real. Not physical. Like markings on a surface, like shapes given meaning by arrangement rather than substance. The hut was a description of a hut. The moonlight was a word for moonlight. Wei's face was a collection of details assembled with intention rather than biology.

Then it was gone. The world resumed. The moonlight was moonlight. The walls were walls. My hand was my hand, and beneath it, a boy's arm was whole.

"What was that?" Wei whispered.

His voice was careful, the way voices become when they're carrying something they're not sure they want to put down. He'd seen it. Felt it. Whatever *it* was — the flicker, the stutter, the moment when the world had shown its seams.

"Nothing. You're tired."

He shook his head. Not a denial — a rejection. He didn't believe me. But the moment was already fading, dissolving into the unreliable architecture of memory, where it would settle alongside dreams and déjà vu and the thousand other small impossibilities that the human mind filed under *probably didn't happen*.

"Flex your hand," I said.

He flexed his hand. The fingers curled and uncurled. The wrist rotated. The elbow — the joint that the healer had declared permanently compromised — bent and straightened with the fluid, painless ease of something that had never been broken.

He stared at his hand.

I stood up.

The memory was already surfacing — uninvited, unavoidable, triggered by the familiar vibration of my own qi passing through damaged tissue and finding its way home. I had done this before. The gesture was ancient, embedded in my muscle memory deeper than language, deeper than identity, deeper than the carefully constructed indifference I wore like a second skin.

A girl. Small. Five years old, perhaps six. Her hands held out in front of her, palms up, the skin blistered and weeping from a forge fire that her father's carelessness had allowed to find her. She didn't cry. That was what I remembered most clearly — the silence. A child with burns that would have broken an adult's composure, holding her hands perfectly still, looking at them with an expression of mild puzzlement, as if her body had done something she hadn't authorized and she was waiting for an explanation.

I took her hands. The burns retreated under my fingers — red to pink to the smooth, unbroken skin of a child who had never been near a forge, never felt heat, never learned that the world was a place that could take from you without asking. She cried when it stopped hurting. The relief, arriving after the fear, was worse than the pain.

Her father knelt. Tears. Gratitude. The broken, gasping thanksgiving of a man who had nearly destroyed the most important thing he would ever make. He asked me to stay. They always asked me to stay.

I left. They always expected that too, eventually.

Three years later, passing through the same region because the road happened to go that way and I happened to need a road, I found the forge. Cold. The roof collapsed. The village had been consumed by one of the ten thousand conflicts that cultivators generated as a byproduct of their existence — a dispute over territory, or resources, or the imagined slight that a Core Formation cultivator had received from a Foundation Establishment elder's tone of voice during a tea ceremony that neither of them remembered correctly.

The girl was ash. The hands I had healed were ash. The father's tears were evaporated, and his gratitude was scattered, and the forge that had wounded her and the fire that had consumed her were the same element, and I was the only one left who remembered that any of it had happened.

That was when I stopped healing.

Not immediately, not with a decision as clean as a surgeon's cut. It was slower than that. Each subsequent injury I encountered — and I encountered many, because the world produced injuries the way rivers produced current — I weighed the calculation: heal this body that would age and break and burn regardless, or walk past it and save myself the arithmetic of caring for a result I could not preserve?

The equation got heavier. The numerator grew. The denominator — the number of people I'd healed who were still alive — approached zero and then reached it and then passed it, into the territory of negative numbers that existed only in my memory, and my memory was very, very long.

I stopped healing. It was the most rational decision I ever made. It was the only decision I ever made that I could not defend.

And now I had healed the arm of a boy who would die — in sixty years, or in six months, or tomorrow, the timeframe was irrelevant; what mattered was the certainty — and the arm that I had healed was flexing and unflexing in the moonlight, and the boy attached to it was staring at me with an expression that I could not look at because looking at it would require me to acknowledge what I had done, and what I had done was *decide that he mattered*, and deciding that someone mattered was the one thing I had sworn, across four thousand years of carefully maintained indifference, never to do again.

"Go to sleep," I said.

"But—"

"Sleep."

He lay back. His arm — whole, sound, functional — rested at his side. His eyes closed. Not because he was tired, but because he trusted me enough to close them.

I left. The door did not creak.

Outside, the stars were cold, and the night was empty, and I stood in the dark for a very long time, doing nothing, feeling nothing, convincing no one.
