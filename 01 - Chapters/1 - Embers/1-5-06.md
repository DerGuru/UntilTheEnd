# Chapter 37

The hilltop. My hilltop.

I'd stopped pretending it wasn't mine somewhere around the second week. Ownership was an illusion I'd abandoned centuries ago — the idea that a person could claim a piece of earth, as though the earth acknowledged the transaction, as though the rock and the grass and the wind agreed to belong to someone simply because that someone stood there frequently enough to wear a path. But this hilltop had my shape in the grass. The flat stone where I sat had adapted to the angles of my weight. The view was arranged the way I preferred it: the valley below, the village to the south, the eastern ridge where Xu Ran's qi-signature pulsed with increasing urgency.

I came here to think. Or to not think. The difference was less clear than it used to be.

The wind was warm. Dry. It carried the smell of baked earth and dying grass and the faint, metallic tang of qi-contaminated air. The same wind that had blown across the valley every afternoon for decades, except now it carried a weight that had nothing to do with temperature or humidity and everything to do with the young man in the forest who was compressing the equivalent of a small sun into his dantian and didn't care what leaked.

Xu Ran's signature was stronger today. Not just stronger — structured. The chaotic pulsing of the past weeks had organized itself into something rhythmic, intentional, the unmistakable pattern of a cultivator entering the final phase of consolidation. He was close. Days, not weeks.

I watched the horizon. The light was strange above his position — a subtle distortion, like heat shimmer but wrong, the air itself bending around a density it couldn't accommodate. Invisible to normal eyes. To mine, it was a beacon.

Then the thought came.

Not mine.

*He wants to touch the sky. He believes he deserves it.*

I went still. Not the stillness of concentration or meditation or the careful immobility that four thousand years of discipline had made automatic. A different stillness. The stillness of something suddenly and fundamentally wrong.

The thought hadn't formed the way thoughts form — emerging from context, moving through association, arriving at consciousness with the fingerprints of their origin visible if you looked closely enough. This thought had appeared. Complete. Polished. Set into my awareness like a sentence placed on a page.

*He wants to touch the sky. He believes he deserves it.*

The words were smooth. Too smooth. They had the quality of language that has been written rather than thought — edited, considered, chosen for precision rather than generated by the messy, imperfect machinery of a living mind. They described Xu Ran's motivation with the clarity of an omniscient narrator rather than an observer.

I knew Xu Ran's motivation. I'd deduced it from his behavior, his qi-pattern, his age, his intensity. Young cultivators at the precipice of Core Formation wanted one thing: ascension. It was predictable and universal and required no special insight to understand.

But I hadn't framed it like that. *Touch the sky.* *Deserves it.* Those were someone else's words. Someone who saw him from above, from the outside, from a perspective that I — despite everything — did not quite have.

I shook my head. The thought faded. The words dissolved. But the residue remained — a feeling, faint and unsettling, like discovering a door in a room you'd been certain had only walls.

Qi-resonance. That was the rational explanation. A cultivator approaching breakthrough could project intention unconsciously — his core desires leaking outward with the excess qi, reaching sensitive minds as fragments of purpose, as translated emotion. Possible. Documented. I'd seen it before. A reasonable explanation from a reasonable framework.

I believed it the way I believed a wall with a door in it was still a wall.

My shadow moved.

Not dramatically. Not in the way that shadows move when the light source shifts or the clouds pass or the body casting them adjusts its position. I hadn't moved. The sun hadn't moved — not enough, not in the half-second it took. My shadow simply — twitched. A lateral displacement, barely visible, as if it had disconnected from its source for an instant and then snapped back, embarrassed.

I looked down. The shadow was normal. My shape, my proportions, my stillness faithfully reproduced in dark negative on the grass. An ordinary shadow doing ordinary shadow things.

But for one moment — one moment I couldn't explain and couldn't rationalize and couldn't file neatly into any framework I possessed — it had been wrong. Desynchronized. As though the thing casting the shadow and the shadow itself were not entirely the same entity.

I stood up. Walked down the hill. The shadow followed, obedient and synchronous and entirely normal.

I did not think about it further.

I didn't.
