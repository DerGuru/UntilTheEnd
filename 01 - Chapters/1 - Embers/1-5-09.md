# Chapter 40

The rooster was the hardest part.

Not emotionally — practically. Mrs. Zhao's rooster had survived the fall from the roof with the offended dignity of an animal that considered gravity a personal insult, and it expressed this offense by refusing to be caught. It dodged. It feinted. It achieved a sustained velocity that contradicted everything I understood about the aerodynamics of overweight poultry. Wei chased it through the village square, around Elder Li's cracked house, behind the water barrels, and into the gap between Mrs. Liu's house and the grain shed, where it turned and regarded him with the serene contempt of a creature that knew, with bone-deep certainty, that it was winning.

"Come here," Wei said.

The rooster did not come there.

"I'm trying to *help* you."

The rooster disagreed with this assessment.

Wei lunged. The rooster launched itself vertically — an achievement of pure spite — cleared his outstretched hands by inches, and landed behind him. It strutted away. The strut was deliberate. A victory lap.

"Use your feet," I said from the wall where I was watching. "Circle left. It will go right."

"How do you know—"

"Roosters always go right."

He circled left. The rooster went right. He was ready. The rooster was not. Wei scooped it up with both hands, pinning its wings against its body, and held it at arm's length as it kicked and screamed and attempted to communicate, through the medium of flapping, its legal objections to the proceedings.

He handed it to Mrs. Zhao, who tucked it under her arm without ceremony and carried it back to the coop. The rooster went silent, which was either acceptance or the beginning of a longer campaign.

"Roosters always go right?" Wei said, shaking feathers from his sleeve.

"Most of them."

"And if it had gone left?"

"Then you'd still be chasing it."

He almost laughed. The sound stalled somewhere between his chest and his throat — a contained thing, arrested by the awareness that laughing felt wrong today. The fence was still broken. The roof tiles were still scattered. The dust from the shockwave was still settling on surfaces that had been clean this morning. People were still moving through the village with the careful, measured efficiency of those processing a shock too large to feel all at once.

He picked up a hammer instead.

The fence took an hour. Wei worked with Chen — the man whose leg had been cut by the spirit beast weeks ago, the wound still visible as a pink line above his ankle. They didn't talk about the explosion. They talked about the wood — which pieces were salvageable, which needed replacing, how the joints should be angled to resist the next impact. Practical things. The vocabulary of survival, which has no words for fear because fear doesn't fix fences.

I replaced the roof tiles. Two clay tiles, standard provincial design, fired in the kiln that the village maintained communally and jealously. I climbed the ladder, seated the tiles in their brackets, and climbed back down. The whole operation took eleven minutes and required no thought and no qi and no cosmic perspective. It was work. Simple, finite, bounded work. A problem with edges. I'd forgotten how satisfying those were.

By late afternoon, the village was repaired. Not restored — repaired. The distinction mattered. Restoration implies return; repair implies continuation. The fence was standing but weaker. The roof was complete but the tiles were mismatched. The well was still yellow. The fields were still cracked. The air still tasted like ozone and stress.

But the village was standing. The people were standing. The children had stopped crying. The rooster was in its coop, planning its next escape.

Wei found me at dusk. I was at the barrier wall — the one that had shifted, the compromised one. I'd spent the afternoon resetting the fallen stones, adjusting the angle, packing clay into the gaps where the shockwave had loosened the foundation. My hands were dirty again. The blisters from last time had barely healed before new ones formed over them, a stratigraphy of manual labor that my body wasn't accustomed to and my pride wouldn't let me heal.

"You moved faster than me today," he said.

I said nothing.

"A lot faster."

I picked up a stone. Fitted it into the wall. Tapped it with my palm until it seated properly.

"When you stopped me — you were behind me. Then you were in front of me. I didn't see you move."

"You were running. It's hard to see when you're running."

"I wasn't running that fast."

I picked up another stone. The wall was nearly complete. One more row and the reflection angle would be restored — better, actually, because I'd corrected an error in the original design that I'd been too exhausted to notice the first time.

"You're stronger than you look," he said.

"I eat my vegetables."

"You don't eat anything. I've never seen you eat."

"I eat when you're not looking."

He was quiet for a moment. Then: "Is that true?"

"Does it matter?"

He thought about it. Twelve years old, sitting on a hillside beside a woman who had appeared in front of him like a thought and deflected every question with another question and refused to explain anything that would require her to be honest about what she was.

"No," he said. "I guess it doesn't."

He picked up a stone and handed it to me. The right stone — granite, dense, the correct weight for the position in the wall. He'd been watching me work. He'd been learning the pattern.

We rebuilt the wall in silence. Stone by stone. Hand to hand. The sun went down. The wall held.

The stars came out. From the east, Xu Ran's signature pulsed — rhythmic, patient, counting down.

Seven days.
