# Chapter 25

The thing that came out of the forest was not a spirit beast.

Spirit beasts had structure — a hierarchy of tiers, a logic to their power, an evolutionary grammar that I'd been reading for millennia. This was something else. Something wrong. A forest cat that had been caught in the qi-displacement of Xu Ran's hunting — soaked in ambient energy it couldn't metabolize, swollen past its natural proportions, its muscles fibrous with unprocessed qi and its eyes the flat, yellow blankness of an animal that had gone past instinct into something that didn't have a name.

It was too big. Too fast. Too present. Nature's gentle suggestion that a forest cat should weigh thirty pounds had been overruled by a verdict of eighty, and every additional pound was restless, jittering with energy that its nervous system couldn't distribute.

Wei was at the forest's edge.

He'd been collecting herbs — the good ones, from the area near the village that still held enough ambient qi to keep plants alive. His basket was on his back. He was crouching, examining something at the base of a birch, his fingers separating leaves with the practiced care I'd trained into him. Serrated: life. Smooth: death. He checked every time. Every single time.

The cat came from the underbrush at a flat run.

Wei's training saved him. Not muscle, not speed — awareness. His senses, sharpened through weeks of stillness and listening, registered the disturbance a fraction before his eyes did: the pressure shift of a large body displacing air, the wrong-frequency vibration of qi-distorted muscle contracting. He threw himself sideways. Pure reflex — the body overriding the brain, choosing direction without consultation.

The cat's forepaw caught his left arm.

The sound was specific: a dry, compressed *crack* that was too loud for the size of the bone it came from. The kind of sound that bypassed the ears and registered directly in the stomach. Wei cried out — short, sharp, the exhale of someone whose breath has been replaced by pain. He hit the ground, rolled, came up clutching his arm to his chest with his good hand.

The cat turned. Its mass carried it past him, claws gouging the earth as it braked. It swung around, tail lashing, and came back for a second pass—

And stopped.

I was there.

Not between them. Just — there. Standing at the edge of the clearing I had occupied a moment ago, or possibly not a moment ago, possibly for hours, the distinction was academic given that my relationship with distance had been renegotiated several cultivation stages past the point where physics applied.

I didn't move. Didn't raise a hand, didn't extend qi, didn't do anything that a mortal woman standing at the edge of a clearing wouldn't do. I was just *present*, in the way that a mountain is present — not threatening, not aggressive, simply occupying space with a density of being that the universe couldn't quite ignore.

The cat felt it. Not with understanding — understanding required a brain that processed abstractions, and this animal's brain was three-quarters qi-damaged static. But with something older. The deep, primal recognition that all living things carry in the collagen of their bones and the myelin of their nerves: the recognition of something that exists on a scale that makes the concept of predator and prey not merely irrelevant but grammatically incorrect.

It fled. Fast — faster than it had come, qi-enhanced muscles firing in a sequence designed by panic rather than coordination. It crashed through the underbrush, snapping branches, scattering birds that weren't there anymore, and was gone. The sound of its retreat diminished over thirty seconds and then there was silence.

Wei was on the ground. His arm bent at an angle that arms don't bend at — the forearm twisted outward below the elbow, the joint visibly displaced, the skin already swelling in a purple bloom that spread while I watched. His face was white. Not from fear — from the specific pallor that occurs when the body diverts all available blood flow away from the surface and toward the core, because the core is where the important things are, and everything else is negotiable.

His teeth were clenched. His breathing was fast, shallow, controlled — the breathing of someone who is managing pain rather than surrendering to it. His eyes were open, fixed on his arm, processing what he was seeing with the clinical detachment that shock provides for free before the bill arrives.

"Can you stand?"

"I think my arm is broken."

"It is. Can you stand?"

He looked at me. The color was coming back — slowly, in patches, like a watercolor painting being reconstituted. He unclenched his jaw long enough to nod, then clenched it again, because opening his mouth risked sounds that his dignity preferred to keep internal.

I pulled him up. He swayed. Steadied. His broken arm hung at his side, immobilized by the kind of protective muscle clenching that the body performs automatically when a limb has announced its retirement. He walked. I walked beside him. The village was ten minutes away, and each minute contained exactly the number of steps a twelve-year-old with a broken arm could manage at a pace that preserved consciousness.

The village healer — a man named Wen, old, experienced, competent within the borders of his competence — examined the arm in his one-room practice that smelled of dried herbs and anxiety. He palpated the joint. Prodded the swelling. Moved the forearm two degrees and stopped when Wei made a sound that wasn't a word.

"The joint is shattered," he said. "I can splint it. Set the bone. But the damage—" He looked at Wei, then at Wei's mother, who had arrived with the speed of a woman for whom bad news traveled faster than light. "He'll lose full use of the arm. Rotation, grip strength. It won't heal right."

Wei's mother stood in the doorway. Her hands were at her sides. They were shaking — a fine, constant tremor, like the surface of water in a glass carried by someone trying not to spill.

"I need the arm," Wei said. Through his teeth. Through the sweat that had collected on his forehead and was running into his eyes.

The healer began constructing the splint. Bamboo strips. Cotton wrapping. A paste that smelled of camphor and old promises.

I stood outside the door. The evening light was wrong — too warm, too kind, too generous for a day that had produced this particular outcome. The forest stood at the edge of the village like an accomplice, silent and implicated.

*Not my problem.*

The words assembled themselves automatically, from habit, from muscle memory, from the four-thousand-year practice of walking away from things that hurt. But they didn't finish forming. They hung in the space between thought and conviction like a bridge that had lost its far bank — structurally intact, functionally useless.

Inside, Wei clenched his teeth and didn't cry. His mother shook and didn't cry. The healer wrapped the splint and didn't look at either of them.

I stood at the door.
