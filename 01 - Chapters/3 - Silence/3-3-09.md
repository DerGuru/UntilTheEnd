# Chapter 28

Evening.

Fire. The small, domestic fire that the settlement's houses shared with the night — orange, crackling, the specific ambient personality of controlled combustion that said: we are gathered, we are warm, we are people in proximity to each other and the proximity is the point.

Wei sat. Cross-legged. The posture of someone who was about to perform — not performing-performance, performing-narrative. The telling posture. The storyteller's arrangement, which in Wei's case was: leaning forward, hands active, voice set to the particular register that preceded embellishment.

"So the lynx came out of NOWHERE—"

"He was territorial," I said. "You'd been training in his—"

"Out of NOWHERE," Wei repeated. Louder. The volume that said: your correction is noted and rejected and the rejection is because my version is better and better is the metric and the metric is: does the story work. "And it was HUGE. Like—" He spread his arms. The wingspan of something significantly larger than a rock lynx.

"It was wolf-height," I said. "Wolf-height isn't—"

"BIGGER than wolf-height. At least — look, the important thing is—"

"You rolled."

He stopped. The stop of someone whose narrative had been interrupted at the wrong moment by the wrong detail with the wrong truth.

"I dodged."

"You rolled."

"I dodged THEN rolled."

"You rolled first."

A pause. He recalibrated. The specific adjustment of a storyteller whose fact-checker was present and whose presence was an obstacle.

"Okay but it FELT like dodging." He grinned. The grin that said: you're right and I'm right and we're both right and the both is the compromise and the compromise is the grin. "And then I hit it. With qi. Full power. And it—"

"Staggered."

"FLEW."

"It staggered, then retreated."

"It flew BACKWARD and CRASHED into the bushes."

I looked at him. He looked at me. The exchange that was the negotiation — his version (operatic, large, impressive) versus mine (accurate, clinical, smaller). The negotiation that always produced the same result: his version for public consumption, mine for the historical record, the historical record being read by nobody and the nobody being the truth.

Almost a smile. Mine. The almost that was the involuntary response to the specific comedy of his exaggeration — the way he inflated every detail by exactly thirty percent, the precise ratio of embellishment that was consistent and that I had been tracking and whose tracking was the amusement and the amusement was the almost-smile and the almost-smile was the permission.

"And then," Wei said, leaning further forward, eyes bright, the brightness that was enthusiasm and was also the other brightness and the other brightness being the thing I was counting — "then I just STOOD there. In the middle. Blood everywhere—"

"Primarily on your left arm."

"Blood EVERYWHERE. And I looked at it. And it looked at me. And I said—"

"You screamed."

"I said, very calmly—"

"You screamed once, then stopped."

He looked at me. The look that said: you are the worst audience.

"I said. Very. CALMLY. 'I can do this.' And I DID."

That part was true. He had. He'd said it — to himself, not calmly, but he'd said it and he'd done it and the doing was the truth that his embellishment was built on and the embellishment being built on truth was the thing that made it tolerable and the tolerable was the almost-smile and the almost-smile was still there and still almost and still mine.

He continued. The story grew. The lynx became larger with each telling — this was the third retelling and the lynx was now approximately the size of a small horse and had teeth that Wei described with hand gestures that suggested tusks and tusks suggested a different animal entirely and the different animal was the one he was fighting in his narrative and the narrative was his and his was the version and the version was the victory and the victory was his.

I listened. Not to the story — to him. The specific Wei-frequencies that existed beneath the performance. His voice: strong, present, the vocal quality of health and energy. His qi: humming, post-combat elevated, running warm. His core: there, behind the performance, behind the grin, behind the enthusiasm that was the surface.

Four times per minute.

I counted. While he talked. While he spread his arms and described attacks that hadn't happened in the geometry he was describing. While his face was bright and his voice was loud and his story was growing and the growing was the joy.

Four. Times. Per. Minute.

His core twitched. Behind his sternum. Behind his shirt. Behind the grin.

He couldn't feel it. He couldn't see me counting it. He couldn't know that while he was constructing the narrative of his victory — the narrative that was true in its essence and false in its details and that was his and deserved to be his — I was constructing a different narrative. One that was true in its details and terrifying in its essence and that was mine and that I deserved to keep because keeping it from him was the thing I was doing and the thing I was doing was the lie and the lie was the principle and the principle was the gamble and the gamble—

"—and then it just RAN," he concluded. Triumphant. The conclusion of a story that had taken fifteen minutes to tell and that covered forty-five seconds of actual combat and whose ratio of telling-to-event was the measure of its importance to him and its importance was total.

"You rolled," I said.

He threw a twig at me.

Almost a smile. Mine. The same almost, the same permission, the same involuntary response to the same boy performing the same joy.

But behind the almost: the count. Four. And the count's trajectory. And the trajectory's endpoint. And the endpoint's—

*He's different. He has to be.*

The fire crackled. The night continued. He told the story a fourth time. The lynx was now the size of a bear.

I listened. Counted. Held the almost-smile and the number in the same space and the space being too small for both but containing both because containing things that didn't fit was my skill and my skill was what I had left and what I had left was the boy and the count and the almost.
