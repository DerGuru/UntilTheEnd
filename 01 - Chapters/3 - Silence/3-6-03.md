# Chapter 46

The fourth attacker came from the south.

Not through the east gate — around. The flanking position I'd tracked earlier: two signatures circling. One held position. The other broke and moved toward Wei's right side, using the wall's curve as cover.

Wei felt it. Turned. Engaged. One hand on the sword, one hand projecting a qi-pulse that caught the flanker mid-approach and pushed him sideways into the wall. Stone cracked. The attacker slid down. Did not get up immediately.

Wei turned back to the east. The specialist had regrouped. Two more behind him — fresh, unhurt, the reserves that professional units maintained because maintaining them was the doctrine and the doctrine was: outlast.

They came together. Two at Wei's front, one working to his left. Coordinated — not identical attacks but complementary, the timing designed to force split attention and whose splitting was the vulnerability they sought.

Wei met them.

His movement changed. Something shifted — the specific transition from individual combat to multiple-opponent awareness that I had taught him in theory and that he was executing in practice for the first time. Wider stance, peripheral vision expanded, the sword working arcs instead of lines. Each cut served two purposes: offensive and defensive, the economy of motion that was the only viable strategy when outnumbered.

He caught one. Blade across the forearm — deep, debilitating. The attacker dropped his weapon. Retreated.

The second pressed. Hard. A sequence that forced Wei backward, step by step, toward the gate. The third circled.

Wei's core flared.

The light — brighter. Pulsing. The specific intensity that I had tracked for weeks, the qi-clock ticking, the acceleration that each burst of full-power combat produced. He was burning his core and the burning was the fighting and the fighting was the burning and the acceleration was accelerating.

He broke the press. A surge — raw, unrefined, the kind of qi-burst that I would have corrected in training because it cost more than it achieved. But it worked. The attacker stumbled. Wei followed. Cut. The attacker fell.

The circling third: arrived. Engaged. Wei blocked. Countered. Missed.

The attacker hit him. Side. Below the ribs. Not a killing strike — a qi-enhanced impact that rattled organs and disrupted breathing. Wei staggered. One knee.

He got up.

Exhale. Blood at the corner of his mouth — bitten tongue or internal. He got up and the getting up was the thing that defined him and whose definition was: he would always get up. Until he couldn't.

He killed this one.

Not by choice. The angle — the attacker lunging as Wei rose, the trajectories converging in the specific geometry of bad luck and timing, Wei's sword up in defense that became offense as the attacker's momentum carried him forward into the edge. Through the qi-guard. Through.

The attacker's eyes: surprised. The expression of someone whose plan had been different and whose plan was now irrelevant.

Wei's face. Looking at the man sliding off his blade. The specific moment when a boy who had been fighting with controlled, non-lethal precision crossed the line that existed between those two categories and whose crossing was permanent and whose permanence was the weight that would have settled later, in quiet, if later had been available.

He pulled the blade free. Turned. More coming.

From the wall, from the east, from the positions that Guo had arranged: more. The professional unit rotating fresh bodies into contact, the specific attrition strategy that relied on one fact — Wei was one, and one had limits, and limits were the thing that professionalism exploited.

---

The sound reached me from the edge.

Not the combat — behind it. Behind the qi-blasts and the sword-strikes and the shouting. A rhythm. Barely audible. Tapping.

*Knock.*

One. Against wood. Or bone. Or the specific surface that Guo used — the signal-board that his unit recognized and whose recognition was the response.

*Knock.*

Two.

I waited. The third knock was the pattern — three knocks, three phases, the tactical trigger that I had not yet seen executed but whose existence was implied in the organization and the organization was Guo's and Guo was a three-knock mind.

The third knock did not come. Not yet.

Two knocks. Two phases. The first: the frontal assault. The second: the flanking. Both active. Both engaged. Both achieving their purpose, which was not victory but expenditure — making Wei use his core, burn his reserves, spend the finite resource that was accelerating toward empty.

Guo was at the edge. Invisible. Patient. Counting.

Not Wei's kills. Not his own losses.

Wei's flares.

Each core-burst: counted. Each full-power discharge: noted. The specific accounting of a commander who understood that the target was not the boy's skill but the boy's fuel and the fuel was running out and running out was the strategy and the strategy was time.

I could feel Wei's core from the west wall. The oscillation — bright, dim, bright, dim — each peak lower than the last, each trough deeper. The curve I had been tracking for weeks, compressed now into minutes, the acceleration that combat produced and that full-power combat produced faster and that the qi-clock had been counting toward.

He was winning every fight and losing the war.

And the war was inside him.

And inside him was the place I had chosen not to go.
