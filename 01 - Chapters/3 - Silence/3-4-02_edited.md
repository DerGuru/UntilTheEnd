# Chapter 31

The well.

The settlement's gathering point — the only structure that belonged to everyone, the shared architecture of water. They stood in a circle around the stone rim with the metal taste in their mouths and headaches in their temples and the dogs still barking.

The elder — not an elder in the cultivation sense. A farmer: sixty-three, weathered, the kind of authority that came from having been here longest. He stood at the well's edge and said the thing no one else would say:

"The qi is — wrong? Can anyone—?"

He stopped. Because he didn't know how to finish. Because the vocabulary of qi-crisis was not in his inventory — his inventory was rain, drought, blight. The ordinary catastrophes with ordinary solutions. This was the earth itself being sick in a language he didn't speak.

Looks.

The looks went to Wei.

Not to me. Not to Lao Chen, who worked with metal and whose metal-working tangentially touched qi but didn't constitute competence. Not to Heiler Mao, whose presence was medical — bones and fevers, not qi-flows.

To Wei.

Because Wei was the cultivator. The only cultivator. The one who trained in the clearing and fought rock lynxes and carried wounded woodcutters. Fourteen years old with scars and glowing hands and the quality of someone who was more than the rest of them.

Wei felt the looks. I watched him feel them — the arrival of collective attention, the weight of twenty-seven pairs of eyes.

He stood up.

Not the casual stand of leaving a chair — the deliberate rise of someone accepting a role.

"The qi source is northeast," he said. "At the mountain slope. I've felt it — it's shifted. If we can stabilize it—"

He organized. Four groups. He assigned them with the clarity that martial training produced — the decisiveness that came from forms and practice and the understanding that in crisis, hesitation kills.

"First group — find the source. I'll lead. Anyone who can carry supplies."

"Second — secure the fields. Move what you can. The grain first — it's the most vulnerable."

"Third — anyone with medical knowledge, go to the sick. Water and shade for the headaches. Mao — can you?"

Heiler Mao nodded. Already moving.

"Fourth — barriers. Dig channels around the north-facing structures. If the soil shifts further—"

He was right. About all of it. The sequence, the priorities, the distribution of labor — he had assessed the situation, identified the resources, allocated them. Not perfectly — there were inefficiencies I could see and that he couldn't, because his experience was fourteen years and mine was considerably more. But the inefficiencies were minor. The structure was sound.

Frau Huang stood at the edge of the circle. Her son beside her — for once close, the unusual proximity of a boy who was usually gone by dawn being present at his mother's side because the wrongness of the morning had penetrated even his twelve-year-old imperviousness.

"The boy knows what he's doing," she said. To no one. To everyone.

I stood apart. Tea — cold. The cup in my hand. Outside the circle, outside the organization, outside the thing that was happening: Wei, in the center, surrounded by adults who were listening to him. Fourteen. Clearer than anyone there.

Pride. Genuine, brief. The involuntary response of someone who had built something and whose something was performing. The teaching worked.

Then: the other thing.

He didn't need me. Not here. Not now.

That was the goal. Had always been the goal. Make him capable of functioning without you.

He was. Functioning. Without me.

And the proof was the absence.
