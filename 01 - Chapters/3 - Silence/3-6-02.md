# Chapter 45

Wei at the east gate.

In front of the wall. Not behind it — in front. On the road, between the settlement and the treeline, in the space that was neither defended nor offensive but occupied, held, claimed by a barefoot fourteen-year-old with a sword and a core that glowed through his shirt.

He released his qi.

Not the dampened version. Not the controlled, trained, carefully modulated signature I had taught him to maintain. The full thing. Everything. The reservoir that had been building for years, the core that was too bright and too fast and too much — he opened it.

The wave rolled forward. Visible — heat distortion in the grey air, the qi displacing atmosphere, bending light. It hit the treeline and the trees shuddered. Leaves fell. The ground vibrated.

The attackers felt it. I saw it in their signatures — the hesitation, the recalculation. Three of them in the first wave: trained, capable, sect-bred cultivators who had been given an assignment and whose assignment had led them to expect an unstable boy, not this. Not a qi-wave that hit like a wall and whose wall carried the specific density of potential that exceeded anything a fourteen-year-old should possess.

Two of them paused. One stepped back.

Wei didn't wait.

He moved. Forward. Into the space between the gate and the treeline — the killing ground, the open area that military doctrine designated as the zone where defensive advantages ended and offensive advantages began. He entered it without calculation, without tactical consideration, with the specific directness that was his nature and that his nature had refined into something that resembled instinct but was actually confidence.

His sword. Lao Chen's blade — folded steel, proper balance, the kind of weapon that responded to its wielder's qi and whose responding was the partnership and the partnership was Lao Chen's craft. Wei's technique: the foundation I had given him, the forms, the positions, the breathing patterns. Plus his adaptations — the things he'd changed because he was Wei and Wei changed things by existing in their proximity. Plus instinct.

The first attacker engaged.

Wei was faster. His cut: diagonal, low to high, the specific arc that exposed the opposing cultivator's qi-guard on the left side. The attacker blocked — barely. The impact: audible from the wall. Steel on reinforced qi. Sparks that were part metal and part energy.

Wei followed through. Second cut. Third. Not elegant — efficient. Each movement a decision, each decision executed before the previous one finished, the continuous forward pressure that overwhelmed technique with speed and speed with intent.

The attacker went down. Not dead — disabled. Wei's blade at his shoulder, the specific angle that severed qi-channels without severing arteries. Controlled damage. Precise.

I noted that. Controlled. He could have killed. Chose not to.

Second attacker. Flanking — from Wei's left, the angle that exploited the opening created by the first exchange. Wei turned. Blocked. The impact pushed him back three steps — heels dragging in dirt, bare feet finding purchase.

He stabilized. Pushed forward. His qi flared — a burst, concentrated, the specific technique I'd shown him for close-quarters disruption. The attacker's guard shattered. Not broke — shattered. Fragments of qi-structure scattering like glass.

Wei hit him. Pommel to jaw. Simple, brutal, effective.

Down.

The settlers behind him. At the walls, at the gate, positioned in the formation that three weeks of rudimentary training had established — not soldiers, not warriors, but organized civilians with tools and the willingness to stand. They stood behind Wei. He was their point. Their shield. The sharp end of a blunt force that would not survive without its sharp end.

Third attacker. Faster than the first two. Better. A sect-trained combat specialist whose training was visible in the fluidity of movement and whose fluidity was the kind that came from years, not months. He engaged Wei with a sequence that I recognized — nine-chain northern style, the pattern that targeted core stability through disruption of peripheral qi-channels.

Wei countered. Not with the textbook response — with something improvised, something that existed in no manual and no training guide, the specific solution that his body invented in the moment because his body was faster than his mind and his mind was fast.

The exchange: four seconds. Six strikes exchanged, three blocks, one dodge. The specialist retreated two steps. Reassessing.

Wei: breathing hard. Sweat on his face. The core-light at his sternum: brighter now, pulsing with the exertion, the light that should have been invisible and that was anything but.

He was magnificent.

That was the word. Not good, not talented, not promising — magnificent. A fourteen-year-old fighting sect-trained cultivators with bare feet and a borrowed sword and winning. Not surviving — winning. The complete expression of everything I had taught him and everything he had become on his own and everything that the combination produced.

The settlers saw it. Their faces — from the wall, from the gate, from the positions they held with their farming tools. The specific expression of people watching something they didn't fully understand but that they trusted. That they believed in. That was between them and the qi-blasts and whose between-ness was the protection and the protection was Wei.

He fought.
