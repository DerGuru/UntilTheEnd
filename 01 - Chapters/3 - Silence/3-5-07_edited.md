# Chapter 43

The last evening.

There was no way to know it was the last evening. That's a lie. I knew. The signatures, the positioning, the pattern I had seen before — in other lives, other wars, other operations that targeted and extracted and eliminated. Tomorrow.

Wei sat on the veranda. Barefoot. Legs over the edge, hanging, the way he'd sat when he was nine and the world was large and the veranda was tall and his feet hadn't reached the ground yet.

He was doing nothing.

Not training. Not sword-sharpening. Not bragging. Not telling a story. Just sitting.

The sun — low, yellow-orange. It hit the mountains and the mountains turned gold and the gold turned red and the red turned dark.

I sat beside him. Not close. The gap: deliberate, the distance two people maintained when both knew and neither wanted to.

Quiet.

The settlement behind us — barriers pulsing, protection signs humming below hearing, escape routes marked and waiting. Everything ready. Everything except.

He breathed.

And then the light.

Not a flicker. Not the intermittent core-glow that came and went. This was different.

A breach.

At his breastbone. Through his shirt. Visible — not suggested, not faint. Visible in daylight. In the golden light of the setting sun, his core produced its own light. Brighter.

In rest. Not combat, not training, not exertion. Sitting. Barefoot. Just sitting.

The light came through fabric the way sunlight came through paper — diffused but present, the shape of the source visible in the surface. Round. At the sternum. Steady for two seconds, then stronger, then steady at the stronger level.

Stage 3. The stage that confirmed: the process was no longer conditional. No longer dependent on activity or stress. Autonomous now. The degradation that no longer needed a trigger because the degradation had become the baseline and the baseline was the countdown.

He looked down.

A boy could see his own chest glowing through his own shirt. That required no expertise.

He looked up. At the mountains. At the red-going-dark.

He didn't say "just tired."

He didn't say anything for a long time.

The silence between us — thick, heavy. Not comfortable, not uncomfortable. The silence of two people who shared the same truth and whose sharing was the silence and the silence was the closest thing to honesty either of us had managed in weeks.

"I'm not going to stop," he said.

Not to me. To the mountains, maybe. To the light. To whatever part of himself was producing the light.

I didn't answer.

"I know what you'll say." He picked at the wood of the veranda. Looking down, occupied with something small, avoiding the larger conversation. "That I should rest. That I should be careful. That the core—"

"I wasn't going to say that."

He looked at me.

The light at his sternum — still there. No longer a symptom but a condition. A core consuming faster than it regenerated.

"What were you going to say?"

The truth? That the light was the stage before the final stage. That the time between this light and the end was measured in days, not weeks. Days.

That I could slow it. That my hands on his sternum, my qi in his pathways, would buy him time. Stabilize the cascade. Extend the countdown from days to weeks.

That I was choosing not to.

That the choice was the zögern and the zögern was the principle and the principle was the cage and the cage was the thing I lived in and the thing he was dying outside of.

"That I know," I said.

A pause.

"This time I fight," he said.

The same words. From the forge. The confirmation: the fight was the choice and the choice was non-negotiable.

"I know," I said.

The sun set. The mountains went dark. The light at his sternum remained — faint, steady, the glow that continued after the sun because it burned with its own fuel and the fuel was finite.

Stars came.

Tomorrow.

Neither of us moved. Neither of us went inside. Neither of us made the decision normal people make at the end of normal evenings.

We stayed.

The veranda. The dark. The stars. The light through his shirt like a second heartbeat.

Tomorrow was battle. And battle was the thing he wanted. And wanting it was the thing that made him Wei. And being Wei was the thing that was killing him.

And the killing was the thing I could have stopped. And the stopping was the thing I chose not to do. And the choosing was the thing I would carry.

The stars moved. The night deepened. His light continued.

Somewhere in the darkness: eight signatures. A commander. A plan.

Somewhere closer: a sharpened sword leaning against a bed.

And between all of it — between the signatures and the sword, between the plan and the boy, between the barrier-protected walls and the unprotected core — me. Sitting. Watching. The gap between us: the distance of someone who would not close it.

Morning would come.

   - "This time I fight" callback cascade: 3 lines → 1
   - Sun set cascade: 4 lines → 2
   - Staying cascade: 4 lines → 1
   - Gravity cascade: 4 lines → removed (the "weight of a choice" section — too explicit)
2. [HIGH] Deleted 9× "specific" tic (escalation pattern, height, feeling, quality, distance, gesture, intervention, curve, gravity)
3. [MED] Broke 12+ "whose" chains
4. PRESERVED: ALL dialog untouched ("I'm not going to stop" / "I know what you'll say" / "I wasn't going to say that" / "What were you going to say?" / "That I know" / "This time I fight" / "I know" — the WHOLE exchange), Stage 3 core-glow at rest (CRITICAL), zögern/principle/cage cascade (CRITICAL — thematic payload), "And the killing was the thing I could have stopped" tricolon (kept — closing beat), "Morning would come" ending (Part 5 closer), veranda image, eight signatures + commander, sword against bed
