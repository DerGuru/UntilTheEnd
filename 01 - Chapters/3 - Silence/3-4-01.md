# Chapter 30

Morning — wrong.

I woke to the weight of it. Not physical weight — qi-weight. The ambient pressure of the room increased, subtle, the specific heaviness that happened when qi-flows in the region shifted and the shifting produced density in the air and the density was the signal.

Like a storm that wouldn't arrive. The barometric promise of violence that existed as pressure rather than precipitation — the held-breath quality of atmosphere that was waiting for something and the something was not rain.

Wei felt it too. He sat up slowly. Not the usual explosion of waking — the tentative rise of someone whose body was registering environmental data before consciousness had time to sort it.

"It feels heavy," he said.

He was right. It did.

Outside: the settlement was already wrong. The specific wrongness of a place where things had changed overnight and the change was visible in the mundane — the fields, the animals, the plants. The domestic infrastructure of a community that depended on stability encountering the specific instability that qi-shifts produced.

The fields. Three of them — the barley, the root vegetables, the grain that the settlement hadn't named but that Frau Huang called "the good one." Brown. Wilted overnight, the cellular collapse of crops whose qi-nourished soil had been disrupted and whose disruption had expressed itself as death in the vocabulary of plants, which was: droop, brown, fall.

Wei's garden. I checked it before he did — standing in the doorway, looking at the three pots.

The dock grass: wilting. The vertical confidence of yesterday replaced by the lateral surrender of today, the stems bending toward the earth with the specific posture of plants that were giving up. The nettle-cousin: worse. Its ambiguous bloom — the small, white, wrong flower — closed. Sealed. The botanical equivalent of retreat.

The lemongrass: holding. Barely. The accidental rightness of this plant proving marginally more resilient than the deliberate wrongness of the others, the irony being that the one thing he'd planted correctly was the one thing that survived longest.

Animals. Dogs barking — the sustained, directionless barking that said: something is wrong and I can't identify it and not-identifying is the distress and the distress is the sound. Lao Chen's cat: gone. Three chickens from the coop behind Frau Huang's house: huddled, quiet, the silence of birds who should have been loud and whose loudness-absence was louder than their loudness.

People. Headaches. Nausea. The physical symptoms of qi-pressure on bodies that didn't cultivate and whose not-cultivating was the vulnerability — they felt the shift as discomfort, as malaise, as the embodied expression of an environment that had become hostile in ways they couldn't name.

Frau Huang: out early. Loud, but not the usual loud — the specific volume of concern that was higher-pitched and had an edge and the edge was fear.

"Something's wrong with the water," she announced to no one. To everyone. "It tastes like metal."

It did. I'd tasted it. The ferric quality of water whose mineral content had been altered by qi-flow disruption — the geological consequence of energy-pattern shifts that ran deep enough to affect the aquifer and the aquifer expressing the shift as iron and iron tasting like blood.

The qi-flows themselves. I felt them — extended my perception outward, traced the energy patterns that ran beneath the settlement and the valley and the region. They were moving. Not the normal, tidal movements that qi-flows made in response to season and moon and the ambient physics of cultivation environments. These were disruptions. Structural. The qi equivalent of a river changing course — the underground energy streams that had been stable for decades now rerouting, compressing in some areas and depleting in others.

The source: northeast. The qi-node that fed the valley — a concentration point where energy streams converged and distributed and that served as the circulatory system's heart for this corner of the world. It was destabilizing. Not collapsing — shifting. Like a bowl being tilted, the contents sliding to one side, the balance lost.

I catalogued. Field damage: three sectors. Animal behavior: flight response in four out of seven domestic species. Human symptoms: twelve adults presenting with qi-pressure malaise. Core infrastructure: water quality compromised. Qi-flow disruption: northeast source, destabilizing.

Wei came outside. He felt it — his qi-sensitivity was developed enough to detect the disruption, to feel the wrongness in the ambient field. His face: serious. The specific seriousness that replaced the grin when the grin was inappropriate and the inappropriate being the context and the context being: things are wrong.

He knelt by his garden. Touched the dock grass. The wilting stem between his fingers.

"What's happening?" he asked.

"The qi-flows are shifting. The source northeast is destabilizing."

He looked at me. Then at the settlement. At the brown fields. At the dogs barking. At the people holding their heads.

He stood.

The standing that preceded decision. The posture of someone who was about to say something and whose something would be the thing that mattered and the mattering was the weight and the weight was the morning and the morning was wrong.
