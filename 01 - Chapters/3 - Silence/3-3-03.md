# Chapter 22

The first exchange.

Paw — lateral, fast, the sweeping strike of a forelimb that weighed more than Wei's torso and that moved with the specific velocity of muscle enhanced by qi and by qi-enhanced muscle being the combination that made qi-beasts the thing they were, which was: dangerous in ways that normal predators were not.

Wei dodged. Mostly. His body moved left — trained reflex, the instinct-muscle-nerve composite that I had programmed into him through months of demonstration and correction. His feet found the ground. His center held.

Almost.

The claw caught his sleeve. Fabric tore — a clean line from shoulder to elbow, the specific rip of claw through cotton that was the sound of proximity converted to textile damage. No blood. Close enough to feel the air displacement of the passing strike.

The lynx didn't pause. The second attack came as continuation, not sequence — a spring, the compression of hindquarters followed by launch, the animal's full weight converted to projectile and the projectile aimed at Wei's chest.

Wei rolled. The specific combat roll that I had demonstrated sixty times and that he had practiced two hundred times and that his body now executed without conscious instruction — shoulder, spine, hip, feet, up. The roll took him three meters. The lynx landed where he'd been. Claws found earth instead of boy. Dirt flew.

Wei stood. Qi in his hands. Bright.

The lynx turned. Fast — impossibly fast for something that large, the pivot of a body whose mass should have required more time to redirect but whose qi-enhancement had solved the physics of inertia the way qi solved all physics, which was: by ignoring it.

It came again.

This time Wei didn't dodge. He met it. The specific decision that separated defense from combat — the moment when a fighter chose to be present in the exchange rather than absent, to occupy the space where the attack was arriving rather than the space where it wasn't.

His qi-hands caught the lynx's momentum. Not fully — you didn't fully catch seventy kilos of qi-enhanced predator at eleven meters per second, not when you were fourteen and sixty-five kilos and still learning the difference between confidence and capability. But enough. Enough to deflect. Enough to redirect.

The lynx slid past. Its flank scraped Wei's shoulder. Contact — brief, hot, the friction of fur-over-skin that said: I am here, you are here, we are occupying the same space and the space is the fight and the fight is happening.

Wei spun. Followed the lynx's trajectory with a qi-strike — palm-forward, channeling raw energy into a directed pulse. The strike connected. The lynx skidded. Recovered. Shook its head.

Not hurt. Annoyed. The distinction between the two being the problem — he'd hit it, and it was still here, and here was the clearing and the clearing was the fight and the fight was not over.

The lynx circled. Now. After two exchanges, after the discovery that this small loud creature was not the easy target it appeared to be — now it circled. The reassessment of a predator whose confidence had been adjusted by data and whose data said: this will take longer than expected.

Wei breathed. Hard. The exertion of two exchanges at full intensity — his lungs processing oxygen at combat rate, his heart driving blood through vessels that were conducting qi and oxygen simultaneously and the simultaneously being the load and the load being visible in the red of his face and the heave of his chest.

But his eyes: clear. Focused. The focus of someone who was present in the present and whose present was the fight and the fight was his.

I stood at the edge. Eight meters.

My hands: fists. The discovery — unbidden, unwelcome — that my hands had closed without my permission. The fingers curled into palms. The nails pressing crescents into skin. The physical evidence of restraint made muscular, of holding-back expressed as holding-on and the holding-on being to myself because the thing I was not holding was the urge and the urge was the intervention.

Zögern-Beat.

The principle: he could do this. He was trained. He was capable. If I intervened now — leaped across eight meters, unmade the lynx with a fraction of my capacity — I would solve this fight and solve him into dependence and dependence was the cage and the cage was the thing and the thing was the opposite of what we were building and what we were building was: him, functioning, alone.

But.

The taste. In my mouth. The specific taste of the inside of my cheek being bitten — not deliberately, not the conscious choice to bite, but the involuntary tension expression that my jaw produced when my jaw was clenching and my clenching was the body's version of the mind's restraint and the restraint was the cost.

Blood. On my tongue. The taste of iron. Of restraint made physical. Of watching someone you — of watching someone fight alone and the alone being the lesson and the lesson having a price and the price being: this, here, blood on tongue, blood on palm crescents from nails, eight meters of distance that felt like a continent.

The lynx charged.
