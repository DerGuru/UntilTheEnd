# Chapter 47

Western hill. Two hundred paces.

The signature expanded. Not gradually — fully. Like a door opened onto a continent of qi. Immortal-stage. And above.

My perception: whited out. Everything else — the combat, the signatures, the barriers, Wei's core — gone. Replaced by a presence on a scale I had not encountered this century.

I turned.

Not a decision. Reflex. The body's response to a stimulus that bypassed thought and arrived at muscle, at bone, at the architecture that said: face it.

Two hundred paces up the slope. Grey morning, grey trees. Standing there — not hidden, not revealed, simply present the way beings of that magnitude were present: inevitably — a figure.

Robes. Simple. The simplicity that only extreme power could afford. Hair: loose. Face: old. Not human-old — the other kind. Age as a number that had stopped meaning what numbers meant.

The Hermit Master. The mountaintop. The encounter that had lasted minutes and contained centuries.

He was here.

My feet moved. Two steps forward on the wall. My body orienting toward the signature the way a compass orients toward north.

His qi reached me. Not aggressive — probing. One Immortal-tier being assessing another. The question in energy: *Are you in danger?*

He thought I was in danger. He had felt Wei's core-flare — the instability, the brightness screaming across the spectrum. And he had come. Because the last time he'd seen me, I was alone on a mountain, and now I was here, and here had a problem.

He was trying to protect me.

The irony. A being who had traveled distance to protect someone who did not need protection. And the protection was the distraction.

His head tilted. Slight. Recognition — not of my face but of my signature. The fingerprint that millennia had established and that no disguise could alter.

He raised his hand.

Two fingers. Extended. The salute. The same gesture — the angle, the height, index and middle finger. The same as before. Friendly. Unsettling. Knowing.

My back was to the east gate. My back was to Wei.

His energy: probing, gentle, the touch of something enormous choosing to be careful. Not hostile. Never hostile.

I answered. My qi met his — brief, confirmatory. *Not in danger. Not from them.*

He understood. Maybe. The tilt: adjusting. The salute: lowering.

A breath. Two. Three.

The combat behind me — distant, muffled. I could hear it the way one hears rain through glass: real but separate.

Then—

My perception snapped.

Wei's core. Behind me. A flare — not the combat flares I'd been tracking. This was a core under maximum stress discharging without governor, without limiter.

I turned back.

The Hermit Master: still there. Still watching. His hand: down. The salute: complete.

I didn't look at him again. My body was already turning, orienting toward the flare — toward Wei—

*Of course. Right now.*

The thought arrived cold. Without weight. The timing was not coincidence but causality — the Immortal arriving because Wei's core screamed, the screaming pulling my attention, the pulling creating the window. Twenty seconds. Enough.

Enough for what, I didn't know yet. But the knowing was coming. In the flare. In the signature. In the quality of Wei's core-light that had changed while my back was turned.

Changed to: less.

<!-- Edit Notes:
EISERNE REGEL ENFORCED:
1. [CRITICAL] Deleted "Book 2" references ×3: "From Book 2" → removed, "on the mountaintop in Book 2" → "The mountaintop", "in Book 2 when we stood" → removed
2. [CRITICAL] Deleted mountaintop MEMORY flashback (EISERNE REGEL violation): "For a moment — one moment...I was on the mountaintop. Wind. Stone. The altitude..." entire paragraph DELETED. The salute reference now stands alone without the italicized memory.
3. [HIGH] E:R improved ~30:70 → ~65:35: stripped analytical cascades (power description, irony cascade, assessment cascade, auditory cascade, quality cascade)
4. [HIGH] Deleted 8× "specific" tics (way, frequency, specific goodwill, specific auditory, specific pattern, specific quality, specific moment)
5. [MED] Broke 10+ "whose" chains
6. PRESERVED: Hermit Master arrival (CRITICAL), two-finger salute, qi-assessment "Are you in danger?", irony of protection=distraction, 20-second window, Wei flare behind Yun, "Of course. Right now." (CRITICAL), "Changed to: less." ending
