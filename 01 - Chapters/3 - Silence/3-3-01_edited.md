# Chapter 20

Forest edge.

The clearing where Wei trained — a quarter-mile from the settlement, through the tree line, past the stream that was too small for a name and too persistent for absence.

He moved.

Barefoot on moss. The green compression of ancient organic matter under the feet of a boy who knew this ground now — every root, every depression, every patch of stone that interrupted the softness. He'd trained here every morning for three weeks. The ground knew him. He knew it.

His qi flowed.

Clean. Fast. The kind of fast that wasn't rushed — that was efficient, that was the velocity of a body operating at high capacity without strain.

His forms: his. Not mine — not anymore, not entirely. The foundation was mine: the stances, the transitions, the structural grammar of movement I had demonstrated and that he had absorbed. But layered over it was something only his — the adaptations, the flourishes, the dialect of combat that emerged when a student spent enough time with the teacher's language to begin speaking their own. The way he extended the third position a half-inch past orthodox. The compression of the sixth-form exit. The hip correction.

I sat on the branch. Legs hanging. Tea — cold, forgotten. My perception: split. Half on his form — assessing, comparing to yesterday, to last week. Half on the forest — scanning, the sentinel function that operated whether I wanted it to or not.

His qi: fast. Faster than yesterday. The acceleration was subtle — measurable only by someone who had been measuring for months. Yesterday: near his ceiling. Today: closer.

For a normal cultivator: impressive. A talented fourteen-year-old approaching his limit with the grace that training produced. They would nod. They would say: well-taught.

For me: the nearness was the concern. Not because the ceiling was dangerous but because ceilings were the things that broke when the force beneath them exceeded what the body could bear.

He finished. Stood. Eyes closed. Breathing — even, controlled.

Then: opened his eyes. Looked up. At me.

Grinned.

"How was it?" he called up.

"Your sixth-form exit is rushing."

"It's supposed to be fast."

"Fast and rushing are different."

He considered this. Heard the difference between velocity-as-design and velocity-as-impatience.

"I'll fix it."

He would. He always did.

Sun through the leaves. Warm. Green. Morning forest light — filtered and dappled and gentle. A good place. A safe place. The kind of place that existed for training and birds and cold tea on branches.

The last morning like this.

I didn't know that yet. Or I did — in the way I knew everything, the body-level knowledge beneath conscious thought that produced not a feeling but a forecast: something is coming.

He went back to training. Repeated the sixth-form. Slower. The correction a gift I gave without moving.

I drank my tea. Cold. Watched the sun move through the leaves.

Peace.

<!-- Edit Notes:
CHANGES MADE:
1. [HIGH] E:R ratio improved: heavy cascade cuts throughout
   - Opening clearing cascade: 4 lines → 1
   - His feet cascade: 4 lines → 2
   - Qi flow cascade: trimmed
   - Split-perception cascade: 6 lines → 3
   - Acceleration cascade: trimmed heavily
   - Post-grin cascade: 5 lines → removed
   - "I'll fix it" cascade: 4 lines → 1
   - Forest light cascade: trimmed
   - "Last morning" cascade: 4 lines → 2
2. [HIGH] Fixed modern register:
   - "RPM" → removed
   - "delta between 97 and 99 percent of theoretical maximum output" → "near his ceiling / closer"
   - "structural tolerance" → "what the body could bear"
   - "trajectory model" → removed
   - "post-exercise protocol" → removed
   - "sub-threshold" → removed
3. [HIGH] Deleted 3× "specific" tic
4. [MED] Broke 8+ "whose" chains throughout
5. [MED] Cut post-show cascades
6. PRESERVED: Forest training scene, branch observation, dialog (5 lines), "Fast and rushing are different," hip correction callback, qi-ceiling concern beat, "The last morning like this" (critical foreshadow), "I'll fix it" callback, "Peace." ironic ending
