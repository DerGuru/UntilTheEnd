# Chapter 58

At the edge. Fifty paces.

A signature. Broken. The specific frequency of a core that had been shattered by something other than death — the forced disruption of structural integrity that produced a signature like a bell that had been hit wrong and whose wrong-hitting was audible in the overtones.

Xu Ran.

Standing. In his torn coat. At the edge of the clearing where I had stopped — the clearing being a consequence of my stopping, the trees around it intact but the grass beneath me: brown, dead, the circle that accompanied.

He saw me. I saw him. Peripheral. Unimportant. Another body in a world of bodies that either lived or didn't and whose living-or-not was the distinction and the distinction had lost meaning.

He felt the aura.

I could see it — the physical response. His face going pale, then green. The specific coloration of nausea. His hands: shaking. Not from cold. From the qi-emission that was hitting his already-broken system and whose hitting was the additional stress on a structure that had no tolerance for additional stress.

Blood. In his mouth. The capillary disruption. He spat — sideways, discreetly, the gesture of a man who maintained propriety even while his body rejected proximity to someone whose proximity was poison.

He stayed.

Not moved forward. Not stepped closer. But stayed — at fifty paces, at the edge of the radius, in the specific position that was: here. Present. Enduring. The trembling in his hands: continuous. The nausea: continuous. The blood-taste: continuous. He endured all of it by the specific method of: clenching his jaw and standing.

He looked at me.

I didn't look back. Not directly. His presence registered the way weather registered — atmospheric, environmental, a condition of the space rather than an occupant of the space.

He understood something. Not the details — not the qi-mechanics, not the timeline, not the specific chain of events that led from a three-knock signal to a dead boy. But the shape. The shape of loss that was visible in the shape of a woman standing in dead grass in rain. The shape that did not require explanation because the shape was the explanation.

His core was broken. Not by death — by hubris. By decisions he had made that had consequences that had shattered the structure. Different mechanism. Different cause. Same result: broken.

Broken understood broken.

He stood there. At fifty paces. Offering nothing — no words, no comfort, no gesture. Because he had nothing to offer. Because offering required having and having required wholeness and wholeness was the thing neither of us possessed.

Minutes. The rain: drizzling. His coat: wet. His hands: trembling.

Then he turned. Slowly. The way someone turned when turning required reassembling the intention to move and the assembling was effortful. He turned and he walked. Away. His gait — uneven, the specific locomotion of a body compensating for a broken core and whose compensation was the limp that was not a limp but was close enough to be mistaken for one.

He did not look back. Not because he didn't want to. Because looking back was the gesture of people who were leaving something they could return to, and he was not leaving because he had not arrived, and arriving required an invitation, and invitations required a host, and the host was standing in dead grass and the host was not hosting.

He would come back. In the next book. Not as an enemy — as something else. But the something else was for later and later was not today and today was: he walked away and I stood and neither of us had said a word.

Fifty paces.

The distance of two broken things that recognized each other and whose recognition was the closest thing to comfort and whose comfort was: insufficient.
