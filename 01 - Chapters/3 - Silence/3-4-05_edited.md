# Chapter 34

The memory came during the walk down.

The settlers were ahead — happy, relieved, moving with the energy of people whose crisis had been resolved. Wei among them, accepting shoulder-pats and head-ruffles. He was laughing. Something someone said.

I walked behind. And the trigger fired.

His face. In the sun. A young person standing in the center of grateful people, smiling, having just saved them. Present-tense and past-tense simultaneously. The present was Wei. The past was—

A city. Thousands of people. Stone walls, market squares. Under threat — I couldn't remember from what. Beast, sect, disaster. The threat had dissolved into irrelevance in the acid of time, leaving only: there was danger, and someone fixed it.

A man. A cultivator. Young — mid-twenties, but young for what he could do. Powerful. Once-in-a-generation powerful. His qi was bright. The word I kept using. The word that kept applying.

He had saved the city. Alone. With the heroism that came from capability married to the stubborn refusal to let bad things happen to people who couldn't prevent them. His wiring. The same wiring.

They cheered his name. Thousands of voices filling the square — the square that would be named after him, that would bear his name in stone for decades.

He stood in the center. He smiled. The real one.

His core was already cold.

Not dark — cold. Running, still running, but the heat depleted by what saving a city required. A fire that had burned too hot. The flame still visible. The wick consumed.

Three weeks. He collapsed. Not in battle — in training. A basic form, nothing strenuous. His core failed. The qi-channels collapsed in sequence — a cascade, dominoes. He was dead before they reached him.

The city mourned. A hero who died of his own saving. A fire that burned too hot and went out.

*They cheered his name. His core was already cold. He just didn't know it yet.*

The memory released. I was on the mountain path. The sun was present.

"You okay?" Wei. Looking back. Over his shoulder. "You're quiet."

"I'm always quiet."

"Quieter than usual quiet." He studied me. The brief study of someone who was perceptive when he chose to be, which was more often than I credited him for. Then: shrug. The shrug of someone who was fourteen and alive and had decided that this was not the moment for investigation. "Come on. I'm starving."

He turned forward. Frau Huang's son appeared from somewhere — as twelve-year-olds do — and said something that made Wei laugh.

He smiled. The real one.

His core — I could feel it from here — was humming. Bright. Warm.

The gong from the cave was still resonating.

I walked. Carried the memory and the present in the same body. The memory saying: this is what happens. The present saying: this is who it's happening to.

*He's different. He has to be different.*

The city named a square after the other one. I don't remember the name. I don't remember the city. I remember the smile. I remember the cold.

Wei laughed. Ahead of me. Fourteen and alive and warm and unaware of squares or fires or the temperature of cores that had given too much.

I walked.

<!-- Edit Notes:

1. [CRITICAL] Memory trimmed from ~45-60 sentences to ~20 (outline spec 16-20):
   - Cut city description: 4 lines → 2
   - Cut threat description: 3 lines → 1
   - Cut man description: 6 lines → 3 (removed "generated the specific attention" cascade)
   - Cut "saved the city" section: 5 lines → 2
   - Cut cheering section: 3 lines → 2
   - Cut platform cascade: 3 lines → 1
   - Cut "cold" analysis: 5 lines → 3 (kept fire metaphor)
   - Cut "knew or didn't" cascade: 4 lines → removed
   - Cut collapse section: 7 lines → 3 (kept "in training" + "dead before they reached him")
   - Cut "Failed" definition cascade: 4 lines → removed
   - Cut mourning: 3 lines → 2
   Final memory: ~20 sentences. Maintains all key beats.
2. [CRITICAL] Added 4 dialog exchanges (chapter had ZERO): "You okay? You're quiet" / "I'm always quiet" / "Quieter than usual quiet" → shrug → "Come on. I'm starving." Natural, character-appropriate.
3. [HIGH] Deleted 7× "specific" tic (energy, image, attention, heroism, square, maturity, temperature)
4. [HIGH] Fixed modern register:
   - "orders of magnitude" → "Thousands"
   - "thermal capacity of the system" → removed
   - "core-degradation symptomology" → removed
   - "vocal apparatus" → removed (in other chapter)
5. [HIGH] E:R ratio improved ~20:80 → ~45:55: cut cascades throughout
6. [MED] Broke 10+ "whose" chains
7. PRESERVED: Memory core beats (city, man, bright qi, saved alone, core cold, three weeks, dead in training, mourned), "They cheered his name. His core was already cold." callback (CRITICAL — outline beat), "He's different" refrain, "I don't remember the name. I don't remember the city. I remember the smile. I remember the cold." (excellent), gong resonance callback, "I walked." ending
