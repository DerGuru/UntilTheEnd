# Chapter 48

The third knock came.

I heard it from the wall. Felt it. The specific vibration that Guo's signal produced — not loud, not dramatic, the quiet precision of a commander who understood that commands were most effective when they were small and that small was the discipline and the discipline was the efficiency.

Three knocks. Three phases. The third phase was the trap.

---

South-west. Smoke.

A building — Lao Chen's forge, maybe, or the storage shed beside it — burning. Not the qi-fire of the assault but physical fire, set deliberately, the specific accelerant pattern of someone who had prepared this in advance and whose advance preparation was the professionalism.

Wei saw the smoke. From the east gate. His head: turning. The reflex that I had watched for months — the boy who could not see a problem without running toward it, whose running was his nature and whose nature was the pattern and the pattern was the thing Guo had mapped and whose mapping was the trap.

Wei looked at the settlers. The men at the wall. He pointed — south. "Go."

They went. Four of them. Toward the fire. With buckets, with tools. The rudimentary organization he'd established: functional, responsive, obedient to the boy who had become their leader by the simple mechanism of being the one who knew what to do.

First knock. First response. Wei had split his force.

---

North. Screaming.

Not combat screaming — civilian. High-pitched, panicked, the specific frequency that human beings produced when they believed they were about to die and whose believing was real enough to produce real sound.

The north flank. Two of Guo's people — I could feel their signatures — had pushed through the barrier perimeter. Not through — around. The barrier's edge, the specific gap that existed where the northern wall met the hillside and where I had not extended the signs because the hillside itself was the defense.

They had found the gap. Or Guo had given them the gap's location.

Civilians in the north quarter. Two families. The screaming: a woman. Children.

Wei heard it.

He looked east — the remaining attackers, still pressing, still probing. He looked north — the screaming.

He ran north.

Alone. The settlers at the east gate: not enough to hold without him but enough to stand. They would stand. He believed that and the believing was the decision and the decision was: the screaming was louder than the strategy.

Second knock. Second response. Wei was now separated from the east gate.

I tracked him from the wall. North — through the settlement, between houses, toward the screaming. His signature: flaring and dimming, flaring and dimming, the oscillation that was accelerating, each cycle shorter than the last.

He reached the north quarter. Engaged. Two sect-cultivators against a fourteen-year-old operating on depleted reserves and adrenaline. He was faster than they expected. He was always faster than they expected. He disabled one in seven seconds, drove the other back beyond the barrier line.

The civilians: safe. Shaking, crying, alive.

Wei turned. Heading back toward the east gate.

And then—

---

East. Beyond the gate. Fifty paces into the open ground.

Moaning.

A figure. In the undergrowth. Hunched over, clutching their side, the specific posture of a wounded person who had crawled to safety and whose crawling had brought them to a location that was visible from the gate.

Moaning. The sound: weak, intermittent, human.

Wei stopped.

He was between the north quarter and the east gate. He heard the moaning. He saw the figure. The distance — fifty paces from the gate, eighty from his position. Open ground. Beyond the barriers. Beyond the settlement's edge.

The woodcutter.

Not literally — but the pattern. Part 3, Chapter 26: a man pinned under a tree, moaning, in pain. Wei had run toward that sound without hesitation because the sound was a person in pain and a person in pain was a problem and problems were things Wei solved by arriving.

This sounded the same. The specific frequency of distress. The timbre. The need.

Wei ran.

Out through the gate. Into the open ground. Toward the figure. Toward the sound. Alone — completely alone, separated from the settlers, from the walls, from every defensive position by fifty paces of open terrain that was neither his nor theirs but Guo's.

I moved. Along the wall. Fast. Trying to close the distance, trying to get an angle, trying to see what I already knew I would see because the knowing was the pattern and the pattern was three knocks and three knocks was the trap.

Wei reached the figure.

He knelt. Hands reaching for the person — the specific gesture of someone helping, the muscle memory of aid, the instinct that Guo had identified and that Guo had placed a body in a location designed to trigger and whose triggering was the execution.

He looked down.

Clean boots.

On a "scout" who had been crawling through undergrowth and dirt and whose crawling had not touched his boots and whose boots were clean the way boots were clean when they had been put on minutes ago and the minutes had not included ground contact.

The woodcutter's boots: covered in dirt, bark, blood. Real boots on a real person in real distress.

These boots: clean. Polished, almost. The specific incongruity that was the tell and the tell was the five seconds and the five seconds was:

*Trap.*

Wei's hand went to his sword. But the figure — the false scout — was already reaching under his coat. Not for a weapon. For a signal amulet. A pulse of qi: bright, directed, the beacon that said *here* and *now* and *he's isolated*.

The perimeter: four signatures converging. From the treeline. From the positions they'd held — patient, hidden, waiting for the third knock, waiting for the beacon, waiting for the boy to be alone in the open ground where alone was the word and the word was the strategy.

Wei stood. Sword up. Core pulsing — dim, bright, dim, the oscillation that was faster now, the reserves that were not reserves but remnants.

Four cultivators. Coming from four angles. The containment that had been a formation was now a kill-box and the kill-box was closing.

And then — from behind Wei, from the gate, from the settlement — a small figure running.

Shen.

Frau Huang's son. The twelve-year-old who didn't hear well. Who had been pushed toward the southern escape route by his mother's hands. Who had not stayed. Who had — of course, of course — followed Wei through the gate because following Wei was what he did and doing what he did was his nature and his nature was the friendship and the friendship was: I go where you go.

Fifteen paces in front of Wei. In the open ground. Between Wei and the converging signatures.

In the crossfire.

*"Man dreht sich um und sie sind weg."*

Frau Huang's words. Part 4. At the erdrutsch. "You turn around and they're gone."

The boy stood there. Small. Confused. Looking at Wei with the expression of someone who had followed a hero into a place that heroes went and who had not understood that the place was the kind of place where following was dying.

Wei saw: the child. The attackers. Both.

The four signatures: closing. Ten seconds. Maybe less.

The boy: standing. Frozen.

Wei's core: flickering. The light at his sternum — visible, bright, the countdown that had been counting for weeks and that was now counting in heartbeats.
