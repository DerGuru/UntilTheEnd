# Chapter 38

It happened at the well.

Midday. Wei stood with Lao Chen's neighbor — a farmer whose name I knew but whose name had compressed to irrelevance. The point was the flicker.

They were talking. Normal. Water, weather, the harvest recovery. Wei was animated — the brightness of someone who was fourteen and had recently saved a settlement and whose saving was the confidence.

Then his core pulsed.

Not internally — externally. The eruption of qi that broke through his dampening: golden, hot, radiating outward in a pulse visible to anyone with eyes. Not just cultivators. Anyone.

For one second, Wei looked like a lantern.

The farmer stepped back. Involuntary. Not fear — just: what was that?

"Your qi — what IS that?"

Wei blinked. Felt something. Deciding whether real or imagined. His hands — he looked at them. Both. The tremor was there — fine, the vibration I had catalogued at Stage 2, now visible to someone other than me in daylight at a well.

"Nothing. Just—"

"That wasn't 'nothing.'"

Wei looked at his hands. Closed them. Opened them. Closed them. The tremor persisted through the first close, diminished through the second, stopped.

"Just tired," he said.

The farmer looked at him. The look that said: I don't believe you, but I lack the information to contradict you.

Wei moved on. Toward the market stall.

I stayed at my position. Wall. Tea.

The flicker had been visible to at least four people. The farmer. A woman at the nearest stall. A child. Shen Liang.

Shen Liang.

He was there. Afternoon. At the settlement's edge — not the market, the periphery. Dressed differently: simpler clothes, a satchel of herbs, presenting as a traveling merchant. The disguise was competent and also irrelevant because his qi-signature was catalogued and catalogued was permanent.

He was distributing salves and herbal remedies. Helping settlers. The performance of benevolence that was simultaneously genuine and strategic — he could do both, and both was the skill that made him dangerous.

Wei recognized him. I watched the recognition cross Wei's face — surprise, then recalibration, then: approach.

They spoke. I was too far to hear. But I could read Wei's body — the posture of attention, the listening that Wei performed when someone was telling him something he didn't want to hear but couldn't dismiss.

Shen Liang handed Wei something. Small. A jar — healing salve, probably. For the shoulder. The kindness of a handler maintaining contact through care.

Then: a sentence. One. I read it on his lips.

"You have to decide, boy. Soon no wall will be enough."

His face. The smile: gone. For the first time, the mask was not operational. His expression was — naked. Not cold like the jade-tablet report. Not warm like the market encounter. Just: there. Present.

Worried? Maybe. Or the pragmatism of someone losing a resource.

Or maybe he was a man in his twenties who had met a boy and recognized something and was now watching the boy walk toward a thing that was coming. And the warning was the truth. And the truth was unsmiling.

No wall will be enough.

Ambiguous. The walls of the settlement — against the sect. Or the walls of Wei's body — against his core. Both readings valid. Both true.

Wei stood after Shen Liang left. Afternoon light. Holding a jar of healing salve. Looking at the road that led east toward the sect gate — the door he had closed and that was now being opened from the other side.

He didn't tell me about the conversation. That evening, at the table, with the rice and the tea: nothing. The first thing Wei didn't share. The first information he kept.

The symmetry was perfect and terrible: I was keeping information from him. He was keeping information from me. Sitting across a table with our separate secrets, the table being the space between us and the space being the width of unsaid things.

I drank my tea. He drank his.

The table held.

<!-- Edit Notes:
CHANGES MADE:
1. [HIGH] E:R ratio improved ~20:80 → ~40:60: cut cascades throughout (opening, animation, pulse, farmer, position, recognition, Shen Liang, worry, road)
2. [HIGH] Deleted 8× "specific" tic (brightness, visible undeniable, vibration, angle, micro-expression, listening, kindness, nowhere)
3. [HIGH] Fixed modern register:
   - "visual cortex processed light" → "anyone with eyes"
   - "bilateral, fine" → "fine" (removed bilateral)
   - "mundane spectrum" → removed
   - "infrastructure of friendliness" → "the mask"
4. [MED] Broke 15+ "whose" chains
5. PRESERVED: ALL dialog (farmer/Wei exchange, "Just tired"), Shen Liang's "no wall will be enough" (CRITICAL — lip-read), first secret Wei keeps (CRITICAL — symmetry of secrets), "The table held" ending, flicker visible to 4 people, Shen Liang disguise/identification
