# Chapter 18

Night.

Wei slept. The sleep that had become predictable in its depth and timing — the body of a boy whose days were full enough to produce exhaustion and whose exhaustion was the permission and the permission was: rest, deep, total, the surrender that only safety allowed.

His core.

I felt it from the doorway. Before I crossed the room. Before I knelt. The specific quality of qi-emission that was audible to my perception at increasing distances — two weeks ago, I'd felt it from a meter. A week ago, from two. Tonight: from the doorway. Four meters.

The range was expanding.

I crossed. Knelt. The nightly arrangement — my knees on the floor beside his bed, my hand hovering, the two-centimeter gap that was the space between contact and assessment and the gap being the protocol and the protocol being: I don't touch, I measure, I measure because touching is care and care is what I do during the day and during the night I am something else and the something else is the sentinel and the sentinel observes.

Light. Through his shirt. Golden, warm, steady — the candle-behind-paper quality that was beautiful and was also the diagnostic indicator of output exceeding containment and containment being the body and the body being fourteen and fourteen being the vessel and the vessel being insufficient and insufficient being the trend.

Four twitches per minute.

I counted. The count was automatic — I started when I knelt and finished when one minute elapsed and the elapsed minute contained: four. Four contractions of qi-stability. Four moments where his core's output stuttered, flickered, reset. Four interruptions in the smooth sine wave of healthy qi-emission that indicated structural fatigue and structural fatigue indicated progressive destabilization and progressive destabilization indicated a trajectory and the trajectory indicated—

Four. Yesterday: three. The day before: three. Two weeks ago: two.

The arithmetic. Two, two, two, three, three, three, three, four. The function. The slope. Positive. Slow. Consistent. The kind of consistent that said: this is not random, this is not fluctuation, this is progression and progression has an endpoint and the endpoint is the place where the slope exceeds the body's capacity to compensate and the compensation fails and the failing is the event and the event is—

I withdrew my hand.

Went outside. The door — quiet, careful, the opening-and-closing of someone who did not want to wake the sleeper and whose not-wanting was the motive and the motive was love and love was a word I did not use and not-using was the habit and the habit was the defense.

Night air. Cool. The settlement sleeping — dark houses, dark paths, the occasional ember-glow of a fire banked for morning. Somewhere: a dog. Somewhere else: the sound of water, a stream, the ambient hydrodynamics of a landscape that existed without him and would exist without him and the without-him being the thought I was not thinking.

The qi-field.

I extended my perception. Not far — a hundred meters. Enough to feel the settlement's perimeter. Enough to feel the ambient signatures: Lao Chen, asleep, his qi like old iron — dull, stable, the resonance of someone who had peaked decades ago and whose peaking was the settling and the settling was the peace. Frau Huang: bright, loud even in sleep, the qi-signature of someone who lived at high amplitude and whose amplitude was the personality and the personality was the volume. Shen: dim, muted, the specific quietness that—

I stopped.

The field. Beyond the settlement. Something.

Not a presence — not a person, not a body, not a cultivator standing in the dark with intent and position. Something subtler. A quality. The qi-equivalent of being watched — the specific shift in ambient pressure that occurred when attention was directed at a location and the location was this settlement and the settlement contained a boy and the boy was the target and the target was the reason for the watching.

Weeks ago — at the market — the attention had been directional. Three cultivators, three lines of interest converging on Wei. That was navigation. That was triangulation. That was people looking at a thing.

This was different. This was ambient. This was the field itself having been altered by the looking, the way that a lake's surface changes not because something touched it but because something is watching it and the watching has weight and the weight the subtle, impossible, unmistakable pressure that said: someone has an interest in this place.

Not in me. I checked — the habit of millennia, the first diagnostic: am I the target? The inventory: my presence was suppressed, compressed, the qi-signature of nothing, of absence, of the void that I projected when I chose not to exist on the detection spectrum. No. Not me. Not this time.

In him.

The attention was on him. On the boy. On the golden light broadcasting through cotton. On the signal that he was and that I could not stop him from being and the stopping being the impossibility and the impossibility being the new shape of the problem.

Before: I hid. They sought me. I moved. They lost me. The dynamic was simple — predator and prey, seeker and hider, and I was the better hider because hiding was my skill and my skill was ancient and ancient was better.

But if they sought him, then hiding was his problem. And his solution. And his skill. And his skill was: none. He had no hiding skill. He had qi that screamed. He had a core that glowed through fabric. He had the specific, beautiful, dangerous quality of someone who was bright and whose brightness was the signal and the signal was the everything.

I could hide myself. I could not hide him. Not without suppressing his qi permanently — and permanent suppression would stunt his growth and stunting his growth was damage and damage was unacceptable and unacceptable was the limit and the limit was the dilemma.

I went back inside.

Stood over him. Sleeping. The glow — softer now, the core's emissions cycling down, the late-night trough of the diurnal rotation. But still visible. Still broadcasting. Still the candle behind paper that was his body and paper was not stone and paper was not metal and paper was what he was and paper was vulnerable and vulnerable was the word and the word was the sentence and the sentence was the one I could not finish.

Four twitches.

I knelt. Pulled his blanket higher. The gesture — the same gesture, every night, the blanket and the tucking and the care that was physical and physical was the only language available when the other languages required saying the things and the things were the words and the words were: they're looking for you now, and I'm not telling you, and the not-telling is the thing that might—

I didn't finish.

The thought. The sentence. The word.

Tomorrow he would wake. Would stretch, yawn, run to Lao Chen's. Would train, cook, exist at the velocity of fourteen. Would be bright. Would broadcast.

And I would sit. And count. And not tell him.

Because telling him was the thing I was choosing not to do.

And choosing was the gamble.

And the gamble was all.
