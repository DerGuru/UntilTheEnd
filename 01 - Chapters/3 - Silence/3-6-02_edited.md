# Chapter 45

Wei at the east gate.

In front of the wall. Not behind it — in front. On the road, between the settlement and the treeline. Barefoot. Fourteen. Sword. A core that glowed through his shirt.

He released his qi.

Not the controlled version. The full thing. Everything. The reservoir that had been building for years — he opened it.

The wave rolled forward. Visible — heat distortion in the grey air, qi displacing atmosphere, bending light. It hit the treeline. Trees shuddered. Leaves fell. The ground vibrated.

The attackers felt it. I saw it in their signatures — hesitation, recalculation. Three in the first wave: trained, capable, sect-bred cultivators who had expected an unstable boy. Not this. Not a qi-wave that hit like a wall.

Two paused. One stepped back.

Wei didn't wait.

He moved. Forward. Into the open ground between gate and treeline. No calculation. No caution. The directness that was his nature refined into something that was confidence.

His sword. Lao Chen's blade — folded steel, proper balance, the kind of weapon that responded to its wielder's qi. Wei's technique: the foundation I had given him. Plus his adaptations. Plus instinct.

The first attacker engaged.

Wei was faster. His cut: diagonal, low to high, exposing the opposing cultivator's qi-guard on the left. The attacker blocked — barely. Impact audible from the wall. Steel on reinforced qi. Sparks part metal, part energy.

Wei followed through. Second cut. Third. Not elegant — efficient. Each movement a decision executed before the previous one finished. Continuous forward pressure.

The attacker went down. Not dead — disabled. Wei's blade at his shoulder, the angle that severed qi-channels without severing arteries. Controlled damage.

I noted that. Controlled. He could have killed. Chose not to.

Second attacker. Flanking — from Wei's left. Wei turned. Blocked. The impact pushed him back three steps — heels dragging in dirt, bare feet finding purchase.

He stabilized. Pushed forward. Qi flared — a burst, concentrated, close-quarters disruption. The attacker's guard shattered. Fragments of qi-structure scattering like glass.

Wei hit him. Pommel to jaw. Simple. Brutal. Effective.

Down.

The settlers behind him. At the walls, at the gate, organized civilians with tools and the willingness to stand. They stood behind Wei. He was their point. Their shield. The sharp end of a blunt force that would not survive without its sharp end.

Third attacker. Faster than the first two. Better. A combat specialist — the training visible in the fluidity of movement, the kind that came from years. He engaged Wei with a nine-chain northern sequence that targeted core stability through disruption of peripheral channels.

Wei countered. Not with the textbook response — with something improvised, something that existed in no manual. A solution his body invented in the moment because his body was faster than his mind and his mind was fast.

Four seconds. Six strikes exchanged, three blocks, one dodge. The specialist retreated two steps.

Wei: breathing hard. Sweat on his face. Core-light at his sternum brighter, pulsing with exertion.

He was magnificent.

That was the word. Not talented, not promising — magnificent. Fourteen years old fighting sect-trained cultivators with bare feet and a borrowed sword and winning. Not surviving — winning.

He fought.
