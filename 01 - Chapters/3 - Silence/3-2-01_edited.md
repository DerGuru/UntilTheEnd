# Chapter 10

Market day.

The larger settlement — two hours east, bigger streets, actual buildings with second floors, the kind of infrastructure that said: people have stayed here long enough to invest in vertical expansion.

Wei walked ahead. Three steps. The distance that used to be one and had been growing.

Stalls. Spices — cinnamon, star anise, something pungent and unidentifiable that smelled like ambition. Fabrics — silk, linen, the rough-weave cotton that farmers wore. Weapons — swords, polearms, farming tools that could become weapons with sufficient intention and insufficient alternatives.

People. Loud, pressing, normal. The density of humanity that markets produced — bodies in proximity, transactions as the organizing principle.

Wei haggled — badly. He understood the concept but not the execution, knew that the price named was not the price meant but lacked the patience for the theater of negotiation. Theater required performance, and performance was Wei's least developed skill. Also his most endearing quality, because it meant he was genuine.

I watched. Said nothing. He'd learn. Or he wouldn't.

He tried fruit. Paid first — then tried. The order of operations that separated transaction from theft.

"These are good." He held up something round and green. "Want one?"

"No."

He bought two anyway. He understood that "no" was sometimes a word and not an answer, and the correctness of this understanding was annoying because it meant he could read me and reading me was supposed to be difficult.

Then: the problem.

His qi.

He dampened it — he knew how, had known for months, the technique I'd shown him in the mountains that compressed his signature into something manageable, something that didn't broadcast to every qi-sensitive being within three hundred meters that there was an anomaly walking through the spice aisle.

But dampening required concentration. And concentration was a finite resource competing with: the sword vendor who had a blade with a wave pattern; the herb stall where he recognized lemongrass and pointed it out to me as though I hadn't identified it from twelve meters; the old woman selling dumplings whose steam was a sensory event; the boy — his age, maybe younger — demonstrating a basic form with a practice sword and doing it wrong in ways that Wei catalogued and almost corrected, visible in the twitch of his hands and the correction on his lips that he swallowed.

He forgot.

Not all at once. Gradually. The dampening thinned. His qi expanded — not like a wave, not like an explosion, nothing dramatic. Like a candle whose shade has been lifted. A brightening. A slow, warm, inevitable increase in presence that was invisible to normal perception and was absolutely, irrevocably visible to anyone with cultivation.

I felt the first look at the weapon stall.

A woman. Middle-aged, sect robes — Inner Disciple level, maybe higher. Her eyes shifted to Wei the way a compass needle shifts to north: automatically, magnetically. She looked. Calculated. Looked away.

The second: a man at the fabric stall. Young, cultivation concealed but present — Foundation stage, competent. His attention snagged on Wei like cloth on a nail. Held. Released. But the release was deliberate — the kind that said: I've noted this, I'll process it later.

The third: harder to place. A presence at the periphery — not visible, not stall-bound, just there. The quality of attention from someone watching without being watched, and the unwatchedness was professional.

Three. Three qi-sensitive beings who had noticed my boy in the space between the sword stall and the dumpling vendor.

I counted them. Automatically. The weapon-stall woman: forty, sect robes, silver thread at the collar — Iron Lotus or adjacent. The fabric-stall man: twenty-five, no visible affiliation, Foundation stage, surveillance posture. The peripheral presence: classification pending.

Wei moved on. Oblivious. Fourteen and at a market, and the market was the experience — the fruit and the sword and the lemongrass. Not the three pairs of eyes that had tracked him across sixty meters.

A spice vendor — qi-sensitive, rudimentary — stepped back as Wei passed. A small step. Involuntary. The physical retreat of a body responding to a presence that was too much, too bright, too dense for casual proximity.

Wei didn't notice.

I did.

He was a signal. He'd been unremarkable — the kind of presence that slid through perception like water through fingers. Now he was broadcasting. Not intentionally, not aggressively, not even consistently — but broadcasting nonetheless, too strong to be fully contained, the containment failing at the edges, and the edges were the market, and the market was full of receivers.

"Can we come back next week?" he asked, holding two bags — herbs, a blade-polishing stone, something wrapped in paper that he wouldn't show me.

"Maybe."

"That means yes."

It didn't. It meant maybe. But he was right that my maybes had been trending toward yes, and he could read the data.

We walked home. Him three steps ahead. The fruit — both of them — in my hand, because he'd put them there when I wasn't paying attention. My not-paying-attention was a lie. His putting was an act of care, and care was the thing he did now that he didn't need to receive it anymore.

Behind us: three gazes. Remembered. Catalogued. Filed.

Not shared.

<!-- Edit Notes:
CHANGES MADE:
1. [CRITICAL] Deleted meta-violation: "I'd spent two books dismantling and two books was enough" — "two books" is structural meta-reference in Keiner Part
2. [HIGH] E:R ratio improved: cut cascades throughout
   - Opening vertical expansion cascade trimmed
   - Three-steps cascade trimmed
   - Market density cascade trimmed
   - Haggling cascade (4 lines → 2)
   - Fruit-buying cascade trimmed
   - "prophylaxis" counting cascade cut + modern register fix
   - Wei-oblivious cascade trimmed
   - Signal/broadcasting cascade trimmed
   - Walking-home cascade trimmed
3. [HIGH] Deleted 7× "specific"/"particular" tic:
   - "The specific density" → "The density"
   - "The specific badness" → removed
   - "the specific order of operations" → "The order of operations"
   - "the specific generosity" → removed
   - "the specific precision" → removed
   - "The specific quality of attention" → "The quality of attention"
   - "the specific detachment that served as prophylaxis" → "Automatically" (also modern register fix)
4. [HIGH] Fixed modern register:
   - "prophylaxis" → removed
   - "ambient presence" → "presence"
5. [MED] Broke 8+ "whose" chains throughout
6. [MED] Cut post-show cascades
7. PRESERVED: Market scene structure, three-gazes surveillance (excellent tension), Wei's qi-dampening failure, all dialog, fruit generosity, "Not shared." ending, spice-vendor recoil
