# Chapter 62

Spring arrived without asking permission.

Blossoms. White, pink, an assertive yellow that bordered on confrontational. The air warm, sudden. Birds reclaiming territory they'd abandoned months ago, vocal about the inconvenience.

Wei stood on the road. Pack on his back. Face tilted up. Eyes closed.

"Spring," he said.

I saw the blossoms. Saw through them.

We walked. The road was wider here — the northwest pass, well-maintained. Trees on both sides. New green.

I had noticed it at dawn.

The bandage.

Wei's left forearm, wrapped in cloth and herbs, tied with a knot I'd taught him in the second week of travel. Applied not by me but by himself. Alone. In the dark. Before he thought I was awake.

The bandage covered a cut. Not deep — the kind of wound that happened during a qi-surge that contracted the body's systems faster than the body could accommodate.

He had hidden it.

Wei — who had, until three weeks ago, brought every scrape and bruise and splinter to me — had experienced a qi-episode, injured himself, treated the injury, and concealed all of it. From me.

Not concealed. Not shown. Not brought. The absence of disclosure. Worse than lying.

I saw the bandage. Said nothing. Waited for him to mention it.

He didn't.

He walked. Spring-bright. Smiling at the blossoms. His left arm angled slightly — favoring the wound. The minor adjustment that the body makes automatically when instructed to compensate.

This was my fault.

The first lie. "Too much qi through immature channels." That lie had taught him: some things are handled alone. And he had learned with the terrifying efficiency of a student who learns not what is taught but how it is taught.

"Your arm," I said. Three hours into the walk.

He glanced at it. "Caught it on a branch. Last night."

A lie. Small. Clinical. Delivered in the tone I recognized because I had invented it.

"Let me look at it."

"It's fine."

"Wei."

"It's fine, Yun."

My name. Deployed as a boundary marker. A closed door, erected by a thirteen-year-old who had learned that names could be walls.

I didn't push. I should have. Pushing was the function of the adult in this arrangement. But pushing would have required explaining why the branch story was insufficient. And explaining would have required admitting what I knew. And admitting would have required revealing what I was.

So I walked. Behind a boy who was learning my methods without my reasons.

We walked. Spring continued its project. The road curved toward the mountains — gray, distant, the patience of things that measured time in epochs.

Wei walked ahead of me. By three steps. Then five. Then seven.

The distance grew.
