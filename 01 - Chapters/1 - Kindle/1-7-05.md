# Chapter 59

Not enough.

The wave was past me. Moving south. One second from the barriers. Two from the village. Four from the slope where Wei stood with twenty-two others and a bundle at his feet and his eyes pointed in the direction I'd gone.

Forty percent of a Core Formation shockwave. Not enough to kill. Enough to break. Enough to crush the grain stores that stood between the village and winter. Enough to poison the well permanently. Enough to turn a community that had survived through stubbornness and root vegetables and a twelve-year-old's water runs into a place where the numbers didn't work anymore.

Not enough.

Two options. Two seconds.

Option one: nothing. Let the wave hit. The village survives — damaged, diminished, crippled. The people survive — probably. Wei survives. His mother survives. Mrs. Liu and Elder Li and Gao and Mrs. Zhao with her shoulder and Xiao Mei with her songs and the rooster with its opinions — they survive. In the immediate sense. In the technical, cardiac, respiratory sense of alive bodies continuing to process oxygen.

The winter kills them. Not the wave. The winter.

Option two.

I didn't think about it. That's the truth, and the truth matters here because four thousand years of existence had produced a mind that thought about everything — that analyzed and calculated and weighed and measured and rationalized every action and inaction with the exhaustive thoroughness of a consciousness that had too much time and too much data and too little willingness to act without certainty.

I didn't think about it.

My hand came up.

Not because I decided to raise it — because the body decided. The bones that had been singing for weeks. The muscles that remembered a posture older than the forest, older than the valley, older than the mountain Wei had asked about by a fire that felt like a lifetime ago. The fists that had clenched on the hilltop when the memory of the fighter came back, and unclenched deliberately, finger by finger, because I'd been afraid of what they'd do if I let them close.

My hand came up. Open. Palm forward. Fingers spread.

Not even necessary. I didn't need the gesture. I hadn't needed gestures in three thousand years. But old habits. The rituals of an earlier era, when power was channeled through motion because the mind hadn't yet learned that it didn't need the body's permission to reshape the world.

Four words.

Then so be it.

The wave was one second from the barrier wall. Half a second from the village. The distance between two thirds of a catastrophe and the twenty-three people it was aimed at was measured in heartbeats and my hand was up and my palm was forward and the four words were not a decision because decisions require deliberation and this required nothing except the thing I'd spent four thousand years burying and four weeks digging back up.

Then. So. Be. It.
