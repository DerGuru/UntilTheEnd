# Chapter 66

Night.

The hut was intact. One of six structures in the village that had survived without significant damage — a fact that I recognized as partially my doing, though the how would have been difficult to explain and I wasn't going to try. The walls stood. The roof held. The mat on the floor was the same mat, in the same position, with the same threadbare sections in the same places.

Wei was on the mat. Sleeping.

Not the unconscious collapse from the southern slope. Not the stabilized stillness from the healing. Sleeping. The deep, slow, genuine sleep of a body that has been broken and repaired and is now doing the ancient and meticulous work of rebuilding itself from the inside out. His breathing was even. Measured. The third-step pattern — inhale on four, hold on two, exhale on six — running automatically, embedded in his nervous system like a heartbeat, no longer requiring thought or discipline or the stubborn effort that had characterized the first three weeks.

The glow was almost gone. Faint traces at his wrists. A thin line at the side of his neck, following the path of the secondary channel I'd restructured. Barely visible unless you knew what to look for and where to look and had the kind of vision that allowed you to see qi-flow through skin and muscle and bone.

His face was relaxed. Twelve years old. The premature lines that field work and drought and insufficient food had carved into his features were smoothed by the unconscious honesty of sleep. He looked young. He looked his age.

His channels were wider than they'd been this morning. Stronger. The flood had done what flood does — destroyed the existing architecture and deposited something new in its place. The new architecture was better. Not because the flood had been kind but because it had been thorough and the foundation — the foundation I'd built, slowly, carefully, brick by brick over weeks of basic exercises and corrected breathing and deliberate, controlled exposure — the foundation had held.

He would be different when he woke up. He would feel the world differently. He would hear things he hadn't heard and sense things he hadn't sensed and understand, with the clarity that comes from direct experience rather than instruction, why I had made him breathe in counts and stand in postures and repeat exercises that had seemed pointless until the moment they became the only thing between him and permanent damage.

He would have questions.

I sat beside him. Legs drawn up. Hands on my knees.

The hut was quiet. The village was quiet. The particular kind of quiet that follows crisis — not the absence of sound but the active presence of silence, the deliberate hush of a community that has survived something and is holding still to make sure the survival takes.

I watched him breathe.

Sometime later — an hour, two, the measurement didn't matter — I stood. Quietly. The motion had no sound. I'd been moving without sound for longer than this village had existed, longer than this province had been named, longer than the language they spoke had differentiated itself from its parent tongue.

Wei didn't stir. His breathing held. The pattern continued, stable, autonomous, permanent.

I walked to the door. Opened it. Stepped out.

The air was cool. Not cold — the residual warmth from the tribulation's energy hung in the atmosphere like a low fever, barely present but detectable. The sky was clear. The stars were out.

The path to the hilltop was familiar. I'd counted it once, long ago. Tonight my feet didn't need numbers.

The stone was there. The flat stone at the top where I sat and watched. It was cool under my body when I settled onto it, the chill of mineral and night and altitude that seeped upward through cloth and skin without urgency.

The village was below. Dark. Quiet. Intact.

The houses, the fields, the well with its cracked wall that someone would repair tomorrow. The granary with its dwindling stores. The path to the river where the trench still ran — raw earth, exposed stone, the scar of intervention visible even in starlight. It would silt in. It would grass over. In a year there would be a shallow depression. In five, nothing.

The forest stretched to the north. Damaged. The trees nearest the epicenter were dead — stripped, bleached, the wood drained of something more fundamental than moisture. But the damage ended. There was a boundary, a rough circle, and beyond it the forest was intact. Dark. Animal sounds — faint, tentative, the first returns of creatures that had fled and were testing whether the world had become safe again.

A bird tried its voice once, then went quiet.

Xu Ran's signature was gone. Not suppressed, not concealed — gone. The direction was south. Far south. Moving fast. The particular speed of someone who had encountered something they couldn't process and had chosen distance as a substitute for understanding.

He would process it eventually. He would return eventually. Not here — not to this village, not to this clearing, not to this stretch of unremarkable territory where nothing was supposed to be. But he would look for answers. He was the type. The type that needed categories and explanations and coherent frameworks and would spend years building them rather than accept the existence of something that did not fit.

That was a problem for another time.

The stars turned. Slowly, imperceptibly, with the patient rotation that the sky performs for no audience and requires no acknowledgment. I watched them the way I had watched them for thousands of years — without expectation, without interpretation, without the human compulsion to extract meaning from pattern.

The village was dark.

Wei was sleeping.

The air smelled like aftermath — scorched wood and wet earth and the faint, almost sweet residue of dispersed qi fading into the natural background.

I sat on the hilltop. Looked over the valley.

And waited.
