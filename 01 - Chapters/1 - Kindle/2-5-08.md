# Chapter 48

Days blurred. North. Always north. Hills became ridges became the foothills of mountains I hadn't intended to cross.

Wei's ribs healed. His arm recovered. The bruises faded through their spectrum — black to purple to green to the pale nothing that remained when the body had moved on.

He trained every morning. Stabilization exercises, performed with mechanical correctness. Compliance without engagement. He did what I'd told him to do. He did it without deviation.

"Your left channel distribution is uneven."

He adjusted. Without looking at me.

"Better."

No response.

"Again."

He repeated the exercise. The correction held.

"Wei."

"Hm."

"The breathing pattern. You're leading with your chest instead of your diaphragm."

"Does it matter?"

"It determines where the pressure accumulates."

He shifted. The correction was immediate, precise — the mechanical responsiveness of a student who was following instructions without questioning them and without trusting them.

"Like that?"

"Yes."

On the sixth day, rain.

Not the gentle kind. The vertical, committed rain that turned trails to mud and made forward progress into negotiation. We sheltered under a rock overhang — the two of us and the dripping and the grey light and nothing to do but wait.

Wei carved. The bird from before was finished. He'd started something new — I couldn't tell what it was. Neither could he, probably. The carving was process, not product.

His hands trembled through the work. The tremor was increasing. Not linearly — in steps, in jumps. Each step a new baseline. Each baseline higher than the last.

"What is it?" I asked.

He held it up. Turned it. A shape that could have been a turtle or a rock or a lopsided fist.

"Fish."

"That's not a fish."

"It's a fish from a specific angle."

"What angle?"

"Inside the fish."

I looked at it. He was right — if you imagined being inside the fish, looking out, the shape described the interior cavity of something aquatic and hollow.

"That's not how carving works."

"That's what they said about my punching."

The rain continued. He carved. Shavings accumulated on the stone between us. His hands shook, and the shaking deposited itself in the grain of the wood — micro-irregularities that gave the surface a texture no stable hand could have produced.

"Yun."

"Hm."

"How long are we going north?"

"Until north is safe."

"Is anything safe?"

The question was not philosophical. It was practical, direct, Wei-at-his-most-precise — a boy who had punched a Dao-Seeking elder and been broken for it and who was recalibrating his understanding of safety based on updated evidence.

"Safe enough," I said.

He turned the not-fish in his hands. Studied it. Put it back in his pack.

"Okay."

The rain stopped in the afternoon. We walked. The trail was mud and the mud was indifferent to our urgency and our urgency was indifferent to the mud and the compromise was slowness.

That night, he slept facing away from me.

This was new. Before — before the lie — he'd slept facing the fire, or facing me, or in whatever position unconsciousness chose. Now he faced the trees.

I sat with the fire burning down to coals. Listening to his breathing. Feeling the stream — weaker at three meters than it had been at three centimeters, but present. Always present.

One night — the seventh, or the eighth — I caught him awake. Facing away. Eyes open in the dark. Not sleeping, not pretending. Simply lying there with his back to me and whatever was happening behind those eyes happening without my knowledge and without my input and without my being invited.

He knew I was watching. I knew he knew.

The clearing agreed with the silence. The fire burned down. The night went about its business.
