# Chapter 45

I healed him by the fire.

The Bear was gone. Wei lay on his back where I'd moved him — two cracked ribs, left side. Deep tissue bruising along the arm. Split lip. A cut along his hairline from the bark.

I worked. Hands on his chest. Qi flowing — minimal, controlled, the dosage that healing required. The bone responded. Knitted.

My fingers trembled.

Not emotion. Proximity. His core pressed against my palms with warm insistence, the reaching, the wanting. My hands on his chest put my qi in direct contact with his core, and the contact triggered the stream, and the stream accelerated.

So I trembled and healed.

"Does it hurt?" he asked. Eyes closed. The question was about me, not him.

"No."

"Your hands are shaking."

"Qi interaction. Normal."

The ribs set. The bruising resolved. The cut closed. His body accepted the healing with the eager efficiency of a young system that repaired quickly and didn't ask where the energy was coming from.

I withdrew my hands. The tremor stopped.

Wei opened his eyes. Looked at the fire.

"Yun."

"Hm."

He was quiet for a long time. The fire moved. The night pressed. Insects. Wind.

"Why am I so strong and so unstable at the same time?"

Three seconds.

The answer existed in my mouth, behind my teeth. *I am the reason. My proximity changes you. My qi feeds yours. If I stay, you get stronger AND more unstable. If I go, you stabilize — and you're defenseless.*

Three seconds ended.

"You're pushing too much qi through channels that aren't mature yet," I said. "The advancement is outpacing the infrastructure. Train slower."

The lie.

It was half-true. He was pushing too much qi. His channels were immature. All real, all symptoms, none of them the cause.

Wei looked at me. Four seconds.

"Okay," he said. "Slower."

He closed his eyes. Turned toward the fire. Drew his blanket up. The compliance of someone who had accepted an answer not because it satisfied but because the person giving it had earned enough credit.

I sat. In the dark. With the lie.

And something clicked. Not metaphorically. A latch. A bolt. A lock engaging — the internal, physical, unmistakable feeling of a mechanism closing. A decision being registered by something that was not my conscious mind.

A bolt fell into place.

The solid, terminal *thunk* of metal meeting metal. A state becoming permanent.

I shook my head. Once. Hard.

*Qi-fatigue.* That's what it was. Exhaustion from the healing, from the suppression, from the breath that had knelt the Bear.

*Not normal.*

The thought surfaced. I pushed it down. It went.

The bolt didn't.
