# Chapter 45

I healed him by the fire.

The Bear was gone. Wei lay on his back where I'd moved him — two cracked ribs, left side. Deep tissue bruising along the arm. Split lip. A cut along his hairline from the bark.

I worked. Hands on his chest. Qi flowing — minimal, controlled, the dosage that healing required. The bone responded. Knitted.

My fingers trembled.

Not emotion. Proximity. His core pressed against my palms with warm insistence, the reaching, the wanting. My hands on his chest put my qi in direct contact with his core, and the contact triggered the stream, and the stream accelerated.

So I trembled and healed.

"Does it hurt?" he asked. Eyes closed. The question was about me, not him.

"No."

"Your hands are shaking."

"Qi interaction. Normal."

The ribs set. The bruising resolved. The cut closed. His body accepted the healing with the eager efficiency of a young body that repaired quickly and didn't ask where the energy was coming from.

I withdrew my hands. The tremor stopped.

Wei opened his eyes. Looked at the fire.

"Yun."

"Hm."

He was quiet for a long time. The fire moved. The night pressed. Insects. Wind. Somewhere below, water over stone.

Wei sat up. Tested the ribs with one hand, then dropped it. Pulled his knees to his chest.

"Why am I so strong and so unstable at the same time?"

Three seconds.

The answer existed in my mouth, behind my teeth. *I am the reason. My proximity changes you. My qi feeds yours. If I stay, you get stronger AND more unstable. If I go, you stabilize — and you're defenseless.*

Three seconds ended.

"You're pushing too much qi through channels that aren't mature yet," I said. "The advancement is outpacing the infrastructure. Train slower."

The lie.

The fire popped. A log shifted, sending sparks upward.

Wei looked at me. Four seconds. His jaw worked once — the thing he did when weighing something he couldn't name.

"Okay," he said. "Slower."

He lay back down. Turned toward the fire. Drew his blanket up.

I sat. In the dark. With the lie.

Something settled behind my sternum. Not metaphor. A bolt dropping into place — solid, terminal, permanent.

I shook my head. Once. Hard.

The bolt didn't move.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [CRITICAL]: E:R ratio rebuilt from ~15:85 to ~80:20. Cut post-lie analysis (half-true paragraph), compliance commentary, extended bolt metaphor, qi-fatigue rationalization. Added external beats: water sound, Wei sitting up (physical action), fire popping, jaw-working reaction.
- Fixed [CRITICAL]: Chapter restructured as dramatic scene — context → conversation → lie spoken → Wei's physical reaction → brief internal → hard cut. No longer reflection-structured.
- Fixed [HIGH]: Post-show analysis eliminated. "The lie." now lands and sits — no explanation follows.
- Fixed [HIGH]: Analytical dominance broken. Emotional weight carried by dialogue and physical detail, not commentary.
- Fixed [HIGH]: Dialogue exchange is now the spine. Wei's question, Yun's lie, Wei's acceptance — all shown through speech and body.
- Fixed [MED]: "particular" — 0 instances (none found in source text).
- Applied Global Patterns: Sparse dialogue tagging (preserved), 1st-person past tense, no melodrama, reflection ≤3 sentences post-lie, physical detail over stated emotion, hard cut ending.
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: Removing the four-sentence "half-true" analysis and the ten-line bolt/qi-fatigue block lets "The lie." land as a gut-punch instead of a thesis statement.
