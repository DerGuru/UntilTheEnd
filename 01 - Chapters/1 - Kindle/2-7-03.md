# Chapter 64

The merchant left us at the crossroads. Went east. We went west.

I waited until he was gone. Then I thought about what I'd heard.

Three sects. Three approaches. The Iron Lotus would follow the Black Moor trail, find nothing, and recalibrate — they didn't abandon searches, they refined them. The hermit-master operated outside institutional logic, on curiosity alone, and curiosity was the most durable fuel source in the human repertoire. And the Heaven's Order had written a letter — "We ask" — and the Heaven's Order didn't ask. If they were asking, they were afraid.

I needed distance. More than the Black Moor feint provided.

Wei was walking ahead. Fourteen steps now. The distance between us was growing at the rate of one step per day.

"Yun."

He'd stopped. Was looking back. Not at me — past me. At the road behind us.

"Someone's following."

I turned. Looked. Nothing. The road was empty.

"Nobody's following us."

"Not following. Watching."

I extended my senses. Road behind: empty. Trees: occupied by wildlife and wind and the ordinary business of ecosystems. Sky: indifferent.

Nothing.

But Wei's face. The expression of someone who felt something that the instruments couldn't confirm — the fine-tuned sensitivity of a system that detected signals below the noise floor.

"The trees are too even," he said.

I looked at the trees. Oak, birch, the usual northern mix. Spaced as the forest had placed them, the organic randomness of—

No.

The spacing was wrong. Subtle. The trees were evenly spaced. Symmetric. As if planted by someone who valued regularity over naturalism and whose cultivation philosophy extended to the physical world.

Heaven's Order. Their fingerprint extended to the landscape. They didn't just occupy space — they organized it. The organization was their presence, projected onto the geography, and the result was a world that was slightly, almost imperceptibly, too tidy.

"The high passes," I said. "West. We go into the mountains."

"Why?"

"Because mountains resist organization."

Wei looked at me. The look of someone who had received an answer that was true and insufficient.

He turned. Walked. Fifteen steps ahead.

The road stretched behind us. Organized. Patient.
