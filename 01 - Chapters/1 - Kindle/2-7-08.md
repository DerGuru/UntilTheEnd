# Chapter 69

The flower was white.

Small. A mountain blossom. Growing in the crack between two rocks, sustained by rain and stubbornness.

We had stopped by a stream. Wei was filling the waterskins, crouched at the bank, his hands in the current — steady for once, the cold acting as a natural dampener.

I was sitting on a flat stone. The flower was directly in front of me. A bud. Closed. White petals folded inward.

It opened.

Not slowly. Not the gradual unfurling that flowers performed over hours. This was seconds. Two, three. The bud opened, expanded, presented itself. White petals — perfect. Symmetric. Each one positioned with the precision of something designed rather than grown.

I stared.

It wilted.

In seconds. The petals became brown. The symmetric form curled, contracted. The stem bent. Broke. Bud to flower to death in less than ten seconds.

Brown paper fragments where a bloom had been.

*Was that—*

I stood. Looked around. Extended my senses — the full range. Nothing. No qi-manipulation. No external force. No cultivator's technique, no sect's signature. Nothing that I could detect.

And I could detect everything.

The stone was cold under my feet. Something shifted behind my eyes — not pain but pressure, the kind that arrived from directions that shouldn't have directions. A metallic taste. Faint. Brief. The taste of something being observed by something that wasn't there.

Then it was gone. The taste, the pressure, the wrongness. Gone. The stream continued. The mountains continued.

"What is it?"

Wei. Standing behind me. Waterskins full.

"Nothing," I said. "Let's go."

We walked. Up. West. Away from the stream and the stone and the petals.

"Yun."

"What?"

"You're walking fast."

I was. I slowed.

That afternoon, the landscape changed. Subtle. Trees more evenly spaced than mountain trees should be. Rocks arranged by size — the geological gradient that would make sense on a riverbed but not on a mountainside.

Symmetry. The Heaven's Order fingerprint. Closer than I'd estimated.

I changed our route. West, harder, into steeper terrain where symmetry was unsustainable.

"Why west?" Wei asked.

"Better terrain."

"Better for what?"

"For being alone."

He didn't argue.

West. Into the mountains. Where the trees resisted order and the rocks fell where they chose.
