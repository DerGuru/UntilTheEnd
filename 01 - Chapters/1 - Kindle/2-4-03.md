# Chapter 33

I didn't sleep that night.

Not unusual — I rarely slept. But this was the first time in centuries that I couldn't. Because the thing in my head was too heavy to put down and too sharp to hold.

*I'm breaking him.*

I sat by the dead fire. Wei slept four meters away. His core glowed — faint, warm, running hot and unaware. My qi flowed to him. I could see it now — couldn't unsee it. The stream was constant. Unchanged by my awareness. Unchanged by my horror. Autonomous.

I watched it for an hour. Cataloging. The flow adapted to his cultivation cycle. When his core pulled, the stream surged. When his channels rested, it eased. The precision was obscene — a four-thousand-year-old energy source calibrating its output to match a thirteen-year-old's intake, and the calibration was happening without my input, without my knowledge, without the conscious deployment that I used for everything else.

My hands were steady. They always were. Even when the thing behind them wasn't.

The most powerful being in this world, and I didn't know what my own body was doing.

Morning. Wei woke. Sat up. Rubbed his eyes with the back of his hands — a childish gesture he hadn't outgrown.

"Morning."

"Morning."

"Did you sleep?"

"Yes."

A lie. Small.

He ate. Cold rice. His appetite had recovered since the descent — air thicker, altitude released, food staying down.

I watched him eat and saw the stream. My qi, flowing. His channels, receiving. The exchange that had been happening in plain sight for months. Possibly longer.

"We should move."

"Where?"

"Into the hills. Valley's too exposed."

"More hills?"

"Different hills."

He packed. Efficient — the routine was muscle memory. Bedroll, pack, stand.

"Ready."

We walked. The habitual gap — three meters. Close enough for conversation. I counted his breaths. Fourteen per minute. Each one pulled at the stream. Not much. Enough.

Wei matched my pace. He'd learned that my pace was information. Slow meant safe. Fast meant something else.

Today I walked slow.

"You're quiet," he said.

"Thinking."

"About what?"

"Route."

He accepted that. Filed it. Stored it for later — Wei assembled incomplete answers into pictures I hadn't intended to give him.

We entered the hills. The trees closed around us. The river sound faded.

The stream didn't. It pulsed — soft, regular, timed to his heartbeat. I watched it the way you watch a crack in a dam. Not because you can stop it. Because you need to know how long you have.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [CRITICAL] Outline pre-emption: Removed all suppression framing from Ch33. Yun no longer attempts distance-as-countermeasure ("We need distance" / "From here" / stream vs. "barrier"). Replaced with pure observation and escalating dread, preserving Ch36 as the first suppression attempt.
- Fixed [HIGH] Pre-emption structural problem / continuity violation: Suppression sequence restored — Ch33 is now observation-only, Ch36 retains its role as first attempt. The "control" framing in the closing paragraph replaced with helpless awareness ("didn't know what my own body was doing").
- Fixed [HIGH] Payoff theft from Ch36: Ch33 ending now builds *toward* suppression (crack-in-a-dam simile = watching, not acting) instead of pre-empting it.
- Fixed [MED] Analytical dominance: Added physical anchors (steady hands, breath-counting, walking slow) to break up clinical observation.
- Fixed [MED] E:R ratio: Shifted from ~28:72 toward ~33:67 by adding physical details and event-level beats (breath-counting, pace change, practical dialogue).
- Applied Global Patterns: Sensory anchors (hands, breaths, heartbeat pulse); dialogue interrupts reflection before half-page threshold; retrospective voice maintained; "Route" lie mirrors "Yes" lie (pattern of Yun's small deceptions).
- Action upgrades: "Today I walked slow" — deliberate pace choice replaces urgency, signals observation mode rather than escape mode.
- Continuity fixes: Valley exposure reason aligns with scout-awareness from prior chapters; "hills" destination preserved for Ch34 continuity ("The hills were gentle — low, forested"); cold rice continuity maintained.
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: Replacing the distance-escape dialogue with quiet observation ("You're quiet" / "Thinking" / "Route") transforms Yun from someone trying to fix the problem into someone measuring its scope — which is far more terrifying and preserves Ch36's payoff.
