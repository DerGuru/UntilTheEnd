# Chapter 33

I didn't sleep that night.

Not unusual — I rarely slept. But this was the first time in centuries that I couldn't. Because the thing in my head was too heavy to put down and too sharp to hold.

*I'm breaking him.*

I sat by the dead fire. Wei slept four meters away. His core glowed — faint, warm, running hot and unaware. My qi flowed to him. I could see it now — couldn't unsee it. The stream was constant. Unchanged by my awareness. Unchanged by my horror. Autonomous.

I watched it for an hour. Cataloging. The flow adapted to his cultivation cycle. When his core pulled, the stream surged. When his channels rested, it eased. The precision was obscene — a four-thousand-year-old energy source calibrating its output to match a thirteen-year-old's intake, and the calibration was happening without my input, without my knowledge, without the conscious deployment that I used for everything else.

The irony sat in my chest. The most powerful being in this world, and the one thing I couldn't control was myself.

Morning. Wei woke. Sat up. Rubbed his eyes with the back of his hands — a childish gesture he hadn't outgrown.

"Morning."

"Morning."

"Did you sleep?"

"Yes."

A lie. Small.

He ate. Cold rice. His appetite had recovered since the descent — air thicker, altitude released, food staying down.

I watched him eat and saw the stream. My qi, flowing. His channels, receiving. The exchange that had been happening in plain sight for months. Possibly longer.

"We should move."

"Where?"

"Into the hills."

"More hills?"

"Different hills."

He packed. Efficient — the routine was muscle memory. Bedroll, pack, stand.

"Ready."

We walked. The habitual gap — three meters. Close enough for conversation. Close enough for the stream, which found three meters laughably insufficient as a barrier.

Wei matched my pace. He'd learned that my pace was information. Slow meant safe. Fast meant something else.

"You're walking fast."

"We need distance."

"From the scouts?"

"From here."

He didn't ask what that meant. Filed it. Stored it for later examination.

We entered the hills. The trees closed around us. The river sound faded.

The stream didn't.
