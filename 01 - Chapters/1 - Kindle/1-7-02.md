# Chapter 56

The forest was dying.

Not the slow, drought-induced decline of the past weeks — the gradual browning, the leaf drop, the incremental retreat of life from the valley's periphery. This was immediate. The trees closest to Xu Ran's position were stripped — bark peeled away by qi-pressure, the exposed wood underneath bleached white, the grain visible like bone beneath skin. Further out, the trees were still standing but emptied, their leaves gone, their branches bare, each one a skeleton of its former architecture pointing at the sky with the accusatory posture of things that had been alive an hour ago.

The ground was fractured. Not the hairline cracks of the drought — deep, structural fissures running through the forest floor like the crazing on old pottery. Qi leaked from the cracks in visible wisps — pale, faintly luminescent, the excess energy that Xu Ran's consolidation was producing faster than the earth could absorb. The wisps rose and dissipated, each one a tiny surrender, a small amount of energy returning to the atmosphere because the ground had run out of places to put it.

I walked through this. Toward the center.

The air was thick enough to taste. Metallic, electric, with an undertone of something organic — the smell of qi at concentrations that dissolved chemical bonds and released molecular gases from structures that had been stable for centuries. Ozone. Iron. The faint, sweet decay of cellulose breaking down at an accelerated rate.

Normal humans would be dead by now. The qi-density at this distance — two hundred meters from the epicenter — was sufficient to disrupt cellular function. The body's electrical pathways — heartbeat, neural transmission, muscle contraction — would fail under the interference. Death would feel like falling asleep: a gradual dimming, a loss of coordination, a slide into unconsciousness followed by cardiac arrest. Quick. Painless, probably. Not a bad way to go, if you had to.

The pressure spiked.

For half a second the air tightened, the way a deep place tightens when you dive too fast. My skin prickled. The river ahead slapped once against its own bank, a sharp, involuntary sound.

Then it eased. Not gone. Never gone. Just reduced back to its steady, murderous weight.

I kept walking.

One hundred meters. The trees were gone — not fallen but disintegrated, their molecular structure unable to withstand the qi-saturation. Where ancient oaks had stood, there were circles of grey dust on the forest floor. Centuries of growth, reduced to powder. The ground beneath was smooth, glassy — the clay fused by qi-pressure into something that resembled ceramic, dark and reflective and warm under my feet.

The river was ahead. My river. My trench. The thirty meters of clay and stone that I'd dug with bleeding hands in the dark, widened and reinforced and aligned with the physics of qi-absorption with the precision of someone who'd been studying those physics since before the trees I was walking through had been seeds.

The trench was intact. The stones held. The water flowed — barely, the drought reducing even this section to a trickle, but flowing. The qi-flow I'd redirected weeks ago was still channeling through the widened section, the water absorbing residual energy with the patient efficiency of a channel doing what it was designed to do.

I knelt at the riverbank. Checked the stones. Adjusted one — a minor displacement, caused by the latest tremor. Half a centimeter. The difference between optimal and adequate angle.

Behind me. Above me. Around me.

Xu Ran's presence.

He was close — fifty meters, maybe less. I could feel his qi-spiral with the same granularity I felt the stone under my fingers. Tight. Dense. Layered. The final configuration — everything packed, everything compressed, the structure complete and the containment holding and the threshold approaching with the mathematical inevitability of a countdown that had started weeks ago and was now in its final digits.

The tribulation.

It would begin soon. Minutes. The qi-column was pulsing — visible now, even to me, even with my senses calibrated for scales that made Core Formation look like a candle flame. A column of compressed energy rising from his position, pushing through the dead treeline, hitting the upper atmosphere and spreading outward in a disc that caught the light and refracted it into patterns that were beautiful and terrible and entirely indifferent to beauty and terror.

I set the last stone. Stood up. Wiped my hands on my clothes — an automatic gesture, the same one I'd been performing for weeks, the physical punctuation that marked the end of one task and the beginning of the next.

The next task was waiting.

I stood at the riverbank. The trench behind me. The epicenter ahead. The village south, three li distant, a collection of empty buildings and a southern slope where twenty-three people and one twelve-year-old boy were safe.

Safe enough.

I waited. The air was still. The ground hummed. The sky was wrong — too bright, too saturated, as though the light itself was overloaded.

The countdown was nearly done.

I could feel it in my bones. The singing. The old frequency, the one that had been part of me since before the first memory and would be part of me after the last. The bones knew what was coming. They always knew.

I stood still. My hands were at my sides. My feet were on the glazed earth. My breathing was even.

Like standing on a hilltop, watching. Like always.

Except.

This time, I was not watching from the hilltop. I was standing in the valley. In the path. In the direct trajectory of something that was about to happen.

For the first time in four thousand years, I was not observing.

I was here.
