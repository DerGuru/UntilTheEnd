# Chapter 14

The fire was Wei's idea.

He had built it with the practiced efficiency of someone who had been making fires since his hands were large enough to hold kindling — which, given his hands, was recently. The flames were small, well-contained, built in a ring of stones he'd carried from the creek. They crackled in the manner of fires that have been constructed by people who understand that fire is a tool, not a spectacle. No wasted wood. No theatrical blaze. Just enough heat to dry the herbs he'd spread on the flat rock, and enough light to see each other's faces in the gathering dark.

I hadn't made a fire in centuries. Maybe longer. Fire required fuel, and fuel required a relationship with scarcity that I no longer possessed. I could warm a clearing with my qi so subtly that the grass wouldn't notice. I could illuminate a forest with a thought. Fire was for people who needed external sources for things I'd internalized so completely that I'd forgotten they were separate.

But I sat by his fire, and the warmth touched my skin, and I let it.

The herbs dried on the stone between us: actual Mingwort this time, correctly identified, properly harvested. His hands were still dirty from the collection, dark earth in the creases of his knuckles. Over the last days, his success rate had climbed from one-in-six to something approaching one-in-three. Not competence — not yet — but a trajectory that pointed toward competence with the stubborn inevitability of a weed growing through a crack.

His father's cough had improved. Slightly. The real Mingwort, brewed correctly, reduced inflammation without curing anything. A delay, not a solution. The river still flowed in one direction. It just flowed slower now.

Wei knew this. I could see it in the way he looked at the herbs — not with pride, but with the calculating stare of someone measuring the distance between where he was and where he needed to be, and finding the gap insulting.

The crickets sang. The fire spat. The forest breathed.

"I want to learn what you can do."

His voice came from a different register than his usual mode. Lower. Without the rising inflection that turned his statements into half-questions. This was a sentence with its feet on the ground.

I stared at the fire. A log shifted, sending a constellation of sparks upward into the dark. They died before they reached the canopy.

"Cultivation," he said. "I want to learn cultivation."

"No."

The word was out before I'd finished thinking it, which was unusual. I generally thought faster than I spoke, faster than most beings in this world could comprehend, fast enough that the interval between thought and speech should have been imperceptible. But this *no* had bypassed thought entirely. It came from somewhere deeper — a reflex, wired into my nervous system by repetition and loss and the accumulated weight of every student I'd ever—

I did not finish that thought.

"Why not?"

"Because it would be pointless."

"Why?"

The fire crackled. I watched the flames divide a piece of kindling into two halves, each burning at its own rate, connected by a bridge of glowing embers that was too thin to last.

"You have no talent."

The words were accurate. I had known this since the first time I extended my awareness toward him — casually, reflexively, the way you glance at someone's shoes to estimate their income. His meridians were narrow. His dantian was shallow. The qi pathways that a cultivator used to cycle energy through their channels were, in his case, the spiritual equivalent of a creek bed expecting to carry a river. He could cultivate. Technically. The way a man with one hand could play the guqin — all the notes would be wrong, and the effort required would be grotesque, and the result would satisfy no one except the man himself.

The silence that followed had texture. It was not the comfortable silence of our shared mornings, nor the negotiated silence of our herb-sorting sessions. This silence had edges. Wei sat very still on the other side of the fire, and the stillness was not his usual energetic restraint — it was the stillness of something absorbing an impact.

A shadow crossed his face. Quick. The kind of shadow that a child's face produces when something hurts and the child has not yet learned to hide that it hurts. Then it was gone, replaced by something harder. His jaw set. His chin lifted. A motion so small it could have been a trick of the firelight, except it wasn't.

"Then show me something else."

"There is nothing else."

"You're lying."

The fire popped. A piece of bark, trapped under a log, releasing its last pocket of sap in a small, sharp report that silenced the crickets for two heartbeats.

I looked at him across the flames. Twelve years old. Dirty. Thin. Sitting on the ground with his legs crossed and his hands on his knees and his face lit from below by a fire he'd built himself, and in his eyes, there was no fear. No deference. No appropriate recognition that the woman across from him could unmake mountains and had told him *no* and meant it.

"You're lying," he said again. Quietly. Without aggression. With the simple conviction of someone who had watched long enough and carefully enough to know.

I turned away. The fire burned between us. The herbs dried on the stone. The crickets recovered and resumed their song, unaware that something had just shifted in the dark — a tectonic thing, slow and underground, visible only in the fine crack it left in a surface that had been smooth for millennia.

Wei stayed. Cross-legged. Hands on his knees. He did not ask again. He did not need to. The question was in the clearing now, and clearing questions, like clearing fires, kept burning whether you watched them or not.

The log collapsed. The sparks flew. The night settled around us like a held breath.

Neither of us moved.
