# Chapter 43

The Bear's second application of qi-pressure was more refined than the first.

He'd learned. The first pressure had been a net — broad, indiscriminate. The second was targeted. Narrow. Directed at Wei's core with surgical precision.

Wei staggered. His hand went to his chest.

The villager beside the Bear flinched. Not from the pressure — from the proximity to forces his biology wasn't designed to process.

I watched. Tactically. The Bear was strong. Three centuries of Iron Lotus cultivation, refined control, precise targeting.

Competent. Against me.

Wei gritted his teeth against the pressure. The stubbornness that prevented him from doing the smart thing — collapse, yield, demonstrate weakness. Let the Bear believe his demonstration had worked.

"Interesting." The Bear was watching Wei, not me. Curiosity replacing the mask of negotiation. "Your boy resists well. For his age. For his stage."

Wei's qi flared.

The spike hit before I saw it — stress and proximity triggering the only response his system knew: produce more. Always more.

His hands glowed. Briefly — qi-energy spilling through channels that couldn't contain it. The ground under his feet cracked. Grass scorched in a one-meter radius.

His nose bled.

A thin line. Right nostril. He wiped it — quick, back of his hand. The gesture of someone who wanted the evidence gone before anyone noticed.

The Bear smiled. Not diplomacy. The hunter's smile. Something unexpected and valuable. A recalculation.

"Interesting," he said again. Different weight. "Instable. But strong. Where does a boy of this age get—"

He didn't finish.

Because Wei's qi was still flaring. And the flare was being fueled by me. By the stream. The autonomous flow responding to Wei's stress by accelerating output — dumping energy into his system with blind urgency.

I was making it worse. Three meters from him. My presence converting fear into fuel and fuel into instability and instability into the very display that made the Bear interested.

The loop. The same loop. The architecture I'd identified and couldn't disassemble because I was load-bearing.

Wei's qi crested. Two seconds — his energy output exceeding anything I'd measured. Foundation Establishment middle phase, outputting at levels twice his advancement.

Then it receded. Shoulders dropped. Breathing ragged. The crash after the spike.

The Bear watched. Eyes sharp, cataloguing.

"Impressive. And concerning. For his own safety, perhaps—"

"His safety is not your concern."

Flat. Below angry. The tone where the performative layer strips away and what remains is four thousand years of being something people underestimate at their cost.

The Bear met my eyes. Held them. And for the first time — a flicker. Not curiosity or strategy. Recognition. The beginning of understanding that the woman he was pressuring wasn't an elder to be courted but something older and deeper and more dangerous than anything his sect had briefed him for.

One second. Then gone.

But I'd seen it. And he knew I'd seen it.

The clearing waited.
