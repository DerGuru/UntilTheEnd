# Chapter 32

I saw it the next morning.

Wei trained by the river. Standard protocol — the stabilization exercises I'd substituted for power cultivation. Breathe. Circulate. Stabilize. The three-step pattern that was supposed to reduce pressure rather than build it.

I watched. Sitting, still, my qi-perception extended to the boundary of his energy field. Routine. Automated.

Then I looked closer. Not at him. At the space between us.

Qi. My qi. Flowing from me to him.

Not visible — not to anyone whose perception ran on human parameters. At the resolution mine operated on, the air between us was occupied. Present. Distributed. The qi equivalent of humidity — imperceptible unless you had the instruments to detect it.

It flowed. Continuously. Autonomously. Without my direction, without my intention.

Like sunlight through glass.

My qi passed through the air between us undirected, unhesitating, following the physics of its own nature rather than my will. Glass doesn't choose to transmit light. Light doesn't choose to pass through glass. It does. Because that's what light does.

I was the glass. My qi was the light. Wei was standing in the sunbeam.

The stream pulsed. Not in my rhythm — in his. His core pulled, and my qi responded. His channels opened, and my qi filled them. Synchronized. Adapted. As though the stream knew what he needed before he needed it.

I watched for two minutes.

In two minutes, the stream delivered more ambient qi-energy to Wei's system than a standard cultivation session would produce in a day. Not explosive — steady. A continuous drip from a source that had been accumulating power for four millennia.

*Oh.*

One word. Internal.

Not his talent. Talent explained why he was good. Talent did not explain why he was impossible. Not his willpower. Will did not produce nine-day breakthroughs through phases that required months.

Me.

My proximity. My qi, radiating outward with the indiscriminate generosity of a sun that doesn't know it's burning the thing that orbits it.

And 47% — the number from the dark — arrived with context. The qi driving him toward fracture wasn't ambient. Wasn't environmental.

It was mine.

*I'm breaking him.*

Three words. Not metaphorical. Diagnostic.

I stood. Pulled my feet from the water.

Wei opened his eyes. "Yun?"

"Have you eaten?"

"Not yet. Why?"

"Eat first. Then second set."

He looked at me. The evaluating look. "Something's wrong."

"Nothing's wrong."

"You're standing differently."

I wasn't. I was standing exactly as I always stood. But his perception — enhanced by the very qi that was destroying him — could read the micro-tensions in my posture that my four thousand years of discipline still couldn't eliminate.

"Eat," I said. "Then train."

He went. Slowly. Looking back twice.

I turned. Walked to the treeline. Stood with my back to him.

Behind me, his qi-cycle resumed. I could feel it — the pull, the intake, my energy flowing into his channels. My poison. Flowing with the quiet efficiency of something that would continue regardless of whether I watched or not.

The willows moved. The river ran. A boy cultivated with the energy of a woman who had just realized she was killing him.

And the sunlight came through the glass and didn't care.
