# Chapter 10

Market day.

The larger settlement — two hours east, bigger streets, actual buildings with actual second floors, the kind of infrastructure that said: people have stayed here long enough to invest in vertical expansion, and vertical expansion is the architectural evidence of optimism.

Wei walked ahead. Three steps. The distance that used to be one and that had been growing at a rate that was consistent with his growing. Their growing was the project and the project was working and the working was the evidence and the evidence was the three steps and the three steps were fine.

Stalls. Spices — cinnamon, star anise, something pungent and unidentifiable that smelled like ambition. Fabrics — silk, linen, the rough-weave cotton that farmers wore and that Wei had worn until three weeks ago when he'd traded for a shirt that was marginally less rough. Their marginal improvement was the sartorial equivalent of progress. Weapons — swords, polearms, farming tools that could become weapons with sufficient intention and insufficient alternatives.

People. Loud, pressing, normal. The density of humanity that markets produced — bodies in proximity, transactions as the organizing principle, the beautiful mundanity of people exchanging goods for currency and currency for goods and the exchange being the point and the point being: this works, we're here, the system is intact.

Wei: alive. He haggled — badly. The badness of someone who understood the concept but not the execution, who knew that the price named was not the price meant but who lacked the patience for the theater of negotiation because theater required performance and performance was Wei's least developed skill and his least developed skill was also his most endearing quality because it meant he was genuine and genuine was rare and rare was the currency he didn't know he was spending. He overpaid by forty percent. The vendor's face suggested a conscience in brief, losing conflict with his income.

I watched. Said nothing. He'd learn. Or he wouldn't. Either outcome was acceptable. The unacceptable outcome was the one where I corrected him and the correction became dependence and dependence became the thing I'd spent two books dismantling and two books was enough.

He tried fruit. Paid first — then tried. The sequence that I'd taught him, the order of operations that separated transaction from theft. Their separation was the foundation of civil living. Their foundation was simple: pay, then eat.

"These are good." He held up something round and green. "Want one?"

"No."

He bought two anyway. The generosity of someone who understood that 'no' was sometimes a word and not an answer. Their understanding was correct. Their correctness was annoying because it meant he could read me and reading me was supposed to be difficult and difficulty was the wall and the wall was eroding and the erosion was him.

Then: the problem.

His qi.

He dampened it — he knew how, had known for months, the technique I'd shown him in the mountains that compressed his signature into something manageable, something that didn't broadcast to every qi-sensitive being within three hundred meters that there was an anomaly walking through the spice aisle.

But dampening required concentration. And concentration was a finite resource competing with: the sword vendor who had a blade with a wave pattern; the herb stall where he recognized lemongrass and pointed it out to me as though I hadn't identified it from twelve meters; the old woman selling dumplings whose steam was a sensory event; the boy — his age, maybe younger — demonstrating a basic form with a practice sword and doing it wrong in ways that Wei catalogued and almost corrected. Their almost-correction was visible in the twitch of his hands and the correction on his lips that he swallowed because I'd taught him that correcting strangers was social aggression and social aggression was not the project.

He forgot.

Not all at once. Gradually. The dampening thinned. His qi expanded — not like a wave, not like an explosion, nothing dramatic. Like a candle whose shade has been lifted. A brightening. A slow, warm, inevitable increase in ambient presence that was invisible to normal perception and was absolutely, irrevocably visible to anyone with cultivation.

I felt the first look at the weapon stall.

A woman. Middle-aged, sect robes — Inner Disciple level, maybe higher. Her eyes shifted to Wei the way a compass needle shifts to north: automatically, magnetically, with the precision of something responding to a force rather than a choice. She looked. Calculated. Looked away.

The second: a man at the fabric stall. Young, cultivation concealed but present — Foundation stage, competent, the kind of practitioner who moved through markets as surveillance rather than shopping. His attention snagged on Wei like cloth on a nail. Held. Released. But the release was deliberate, the kind of deliberate that said: I've noted this, I'll process it later, later is the operative word.

The third: harder to place. A presence at the periphery — not visible, not stall-bound, just there. The quality of attention that came from someone who was watching without being watched. Their unwatchedness was professional.

Three. Three qi-sensitive beings who had noticed my boy in the space between the sword stall and the dumpling vendor.

I counted them. The way I counted everything — automatically, with the detachment that served as prophylaxis against the alternative, which was panic, and panic was not useful and usefulness was the metric and the metric said: count, catalogue, remember faces.

The weapon-stall woman: forty, sect robes, silver thread at the collar — Iron Lotus or adjacent. The fabric-stall man: twenty-five, no visible affiliation, Foundation stage, surveillance posture. The peripheral presence: classification pending.

Wei moved on. Oblivious. The obliviousness of someone who was fourteen and on a market. Their market-ness was the experience and the experience was the fruit and the sword and the lemongrass and not the three pairs of eyes that had tracked him across sixty meters of stall-to-stall navigation.

He could identify a quality blade at ten paces but not a surveillance operative at thirty. Priorities.

A spice vendor — qi-sensitive, rudimentary, the kind of sensitivity that came not from cultivation but from proximity to qi-rich environments — stepped back as Wei passed. A small step. Involuntary. The physical retreat of a body responding to a presence that was too much, too bright, too dense for casual proximity.

Wei didn't notice.

I did.

He was a signal. He'd been a boy at the edge — unremarkable, average, the kind of presence that slid through perception like water through fingers. Now he was broadcasting. Not intentionally, not aggressively, not even consistently — but broadcasting nonetheless, the intermittent transmission of a source that was too strong to be fully contained. Their containment was failing at the edges. Their edges were the market and the market was full of receivers.

"Can we come back next week?" he asked, holding two bags — herbs, a blade-polishing stone, something wrapped in paper that he wouldn't show me.

"Maybe."

"That means yes."

It didn't. It meant: maybe. But he was right that my maybes had been trending toward yes and the trending was the data and the data was his and he could read it and reading it was the skill and the skill was his and his was the pronoun and the pronoun was the problem because the problem was no longer mine to solve alone.

We walked home. Him three steps ahead. The fruit — both of them — in my hand, because he'd put them there when I wasn't paying attention and my not-paying-attention was a lie and his putting was the act and the act was care and care was the thing he did now that he didn't need to receive it anymore.

Behind us: three gazes. Remembered. Catalogued. Filed.

Not shared.
