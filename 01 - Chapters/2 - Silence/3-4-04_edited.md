# Chapter 33

The qi source.

Northeast. The mountain slope — an hour's hike through forest that was sick now, trees showing the stress in their canopy, leaves curling inward to protect against something invisible.

Wei led. Four settlers behind him — the supply carriers, the ones he'd selected. Adults. Middle-aged. Following a boy up a mountain because the boy was the one who knew where the mountain hurt.

I followed. Behind the group. Far enough to be background, close enough to be available.

The cave.

Small. A fissure in the rock face, barely wide enough for one person, descending into darkness. The qi-source: inside. The convergence point — the node where underground energy streams met and distributed. The valley's qi-heart. Arrhythmic now.

Wei stopped at the entrance. Looked back at the settlers.

"Wait here."

"Wei—"

"It's narrow. And the qi-pressure inside is going to be strong. Anyone without cultivation will get sick."

He was right. The corridor would be saturated — compressed qi from a destabilized source in a confined space. For ordinary bodies: migraine, nausea, vertigo. For cultivators: manageable. Barely.

He looked at me.

The look.

Not will you help — will you let me. Two requests in one glance: permission and trust. The permission that was not a blessing but a release, a loosening of the tie between his actions and my approval. And the trust of someone who was about to walk into danger and wanted to know that the person behind him was steady.

I could have gone in. Walked past him, descended, identified the disruption in seconds, corrected it with a fraction of my capacity. Done. The settlers would have gone home. The fields would recover. Everything fixed, everything stable, everything: Yun handled it.

And Wei would have stood at the entrance. Watching. Bypassed. Rendered irrelevant by the efficiency of someone whose efficiency was millennia deep and whose depth made everyone around her unnecessary. And unnecessary was the wound. And the wound was the thing I was healing. And healing required this.

"I'll be at the entrance," I said.

He nodded. Turned. Descended.

The darkness swallowed him — incrementally, light yielding to curvature and curvature to depth. Where he was going. Where I was not.

I stood at the entrance. The settlers behind me. The forest sick around us. The mountain containing the source and the source containing my boy.

I could feel him. His qi-signature — bright, distinctive, the signature I could find in any crowd and any cave and any continent because finding him was the reflex and the reflex was permanent.

He moved deeper. Steady. Descending. Approaching the node. I tracked his progress the way I tracked everything — continuously, converting terror into data.

Twenty minutes.

He reached the node. I felt it — the sudden increase in ambient qi-pressure as the source responded to his presence. The convergence point recognizing a cultivator in its space.

He began.

The stabilization — qi channeled into the disrupted node, finding the imbalances, the energy-tilts, the dislocations that had caused the surface symptoms. Layer by layer. Methodical. For a fourteen-year-old: extraordinary. The kind of work that trained specialists performed after years of study. Requiring sensitivity and control and the patience to correct without overcorrecting — and patience being Wei's least natural quality, which made his doing it anyway the triumph.

I counted.

His core. During the stabilization. While his qi was extended into the source, while his control was at maximum:

The first twitch. Light. A stumble in the signal — his core's output flickering, catching, recovering. Like a foot missing a step and correcting. Barely noticeable.

Noticed.

I gripped the cave wall. Stone under my fingers. Cold.

He continued. Deeper into the work. The source responding — slowly, the energy patterns beginning to realign. He was doing it.

The second twitch. Stronger. His core pulsing — not flickering but PULSING, the overcorrection of a system compensating for the first instability by adding force. Like bailing water with a bigger bucket: effective temporarily, damaging structurally.

I felt my nails against the stone.

He was finishing. The source: stabilizing. The patterns: aligning. Almost done. Almost—

The third twitch. The strongest. His core FLARED — bright, hot, the full-intensity discharge of a system that had exceeded its capacity. Like a gong struck too hard: the note was correct but the vibration was excessive, the resonance lingering beyond where it should have stopped.

The gong continued.

And Wei finished. The source: stable. The patterns: aligned. The valley: saved.

He emerged.

From the cave. Into the light. Dusty, sweating, face pale with exertion. But standing. But grinning.

"Done," he said.

The settlers felt it. The immediate change. Qi-pressure lifting. Headaches receding. The air: lighter. The relief that happened when the world went from wrong to right and the right was the boy standing in the entrance of a cave and grinning.

They cheered. Not organized — the spontaneous vocalization of relief from people whose pain had stopped. His name. Wei. The boy who'd fixed the earth.

He stood in the middle. Surrounded by grateful adults. Old hands on his shoulders, voices thanking him, eyes looking at him with the gratitude of people who had been afraid and were no longer afraid.

He smiled. Not the grin — the smile. The quieter, deeper version. Not performance but presence. The smile of someone who had done something real and whose realness was the feeling: I matter.

Then: his hands.

I saw them before he did. The tremor — both hands, the post-exertion vibration that was not normal because normal tremors were coarse and asymmetric and this was fine and symmetric. Core-mediated, not muscular.

He balled his fists. The trembling stopped.

"Just tired," he said.

To himself. To no one. The phrase becoming a refrain.

He didn't notice the tremor. Or he noticed it and filed it under: normal. Because normal was the category his fourteen-year-old psychology assigned to things that happened after effort. And the explanation was sufficient because sufficiency was the thing he needed.

The settlers started down the mountain.

I followed. Behind. With the count — three twitches during stabilization, each stronger than the last. The hands — trembling, symmetric. The phrase — just tired. The refrain of a boy whose body was speaking a language he couldn't hear.

Qi-Clock, Stage 2. Confirmed.

The gong was still ringing.

4. [MED] Broke 9+ "whose" chains
5. PRESERVED: Cave descent (CRITICAL), Zögern-Beat "I'll be at the entrance" (outline beat), three twitches escalating (light→stronger→FLARE — CRITICAL qi-clock data), gong metaphor, settler jubilation, "Done" dialog, hands trembling (Qi-Uhr Stufe 2), "Just tired" refrain (CRITICAL recurring denial), "The gong was still ringing" ending, "I matter" smile
