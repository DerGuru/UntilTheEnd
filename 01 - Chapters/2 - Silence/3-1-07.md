# Chapter 7

Wei cooked dinner. Properly. With ambition.

Rice — washed three times, because Frau Huang had explained that twice was laziness and once was an insult and three times was respect for the grain and the grain deserved respect because the grain had traveled from a field to a market to a pot and the journey warranted acknowledgment. Vegetables — bias-cut, because of course. A piece of pork that he'd bought at the market for a price he announced with the pride of someone who had negotiated a transaction and won. Their winning was measured in coppers. Their coppers were significant because significance was contextual and context was a fourteen-year-old boy with a budget.

"Too much," I said. Meaning: the pork. The cost.

"It's fine."

"We don't need—"

"It's fine, Yun."

My name. Deployed as period, not comma. The sentence-ending version of the name that said: this topic is concluded. He'd learned that from me. The use of someone's name as a full stop, as a boundary, as the verbal equivalent of a wall placed precisely in the path of a conversation that was heading somewhere neither party wanted it to go.

He cooked. I sat. The arrangement was — domestic. The word arrived with its full weight, its implications, its gravity. Domestic: pertaining to the home, to the household, to the arrangement of daily life around the twin axes of nourishment and shelter. We were domestic. We had become domestic. The becoming had happened without my noticing because becoming is incremental and incremental things defeat attention the way water defeats stone — not dramatically but inevitably.

Outside, the evening performed its transition. Light became less. Shadows became more. The settlement's daytime population yielded to its evening population, which was the same population in different configurations — inside instead of outside, seated instead of standing, quieter instead of louder.

Frau Huang's voice. Carrying across the yards and fences and the acoustic architecture of a settlement where buildings were close enough that privacy was a concept rather than a condition.

"SHEN! NACH HAUSE! JETZT!"

The Deaf Boy — somewhere between our yard and the next — did not respond. The non-response was so consistent, so reliable, so thoroughly executed that it constituted its own form of communication: I hear you, I am choosing not to process the input, the choice is mine, the mine-ness is the point.

"That boy," Frau Huang said. To the evening. To the fence. To the structural indifference of a twelve-year-old who had perfected the art of auditory selection. "He hears when it's too late."

The words passed through me. Through the window. Through the evening air that carried them without editorial comment. They landed somewhere inside me and did not register as anything other than a mother's complaint about a son's selective hearing, which was universal, which was the frustration of every parent since the invention of language and children and the collision between the two.

I filed them. Unconsciously. In the category of "things that are said" rather than the category of "things that matter." The filing was automatic, the way all filing was automatic for me — comprehensive, undiscriminating, storing everything because everything might be relevant and relevance was not always apparent at the time of acquisition.

Wei set the table. Two bowls. Two sets of chopsticks. The rice: steaming, correctly washed, the texture that indicated he'd learned the water ratio and the heat timing and the moment when the lid came off and the moment was now muscle memory rather than calculation.

"Bleiben wir hier?" he asked.

The question arrived between the rice and the pork, in the conversational space that dinner provided, the territory between first bite and second where topics could be introduced with the casualness that the food's presence encouraged because food was a form of safety and safety was where questions lived that couldn't live elsewhere.

"Vielleicht."

"That's not a yes."

"It's not a no."

"You said that before."

"I'll say it again."

He ate. Chewed. The silence between bites was the silence of someone processing not the food but the response and finding the response insufficient but acceptable and the acceptability determined not by the response's content but by the relationship's parameters and the parameters included the category of "things Yun says when she means yes but can't commit to yes because yes is a form of permanence and permanence is a concept she doesn't trust."

He knew all of this. He understood the architecture of my evasions the way he understood the architecture of qi-cultivation — through observation, through pattern recognition, through the intelligence of someone who had lived alongside a being for long enough that the being's defenses had become transparent to anyone who paid attention and Wei paid attention the way he did everything else, which was to say completely.

"I like it here," he said.

"I know."

"The market's good. Lao Chen is—" He searched. "Lao Chen is real."

Real. The word he chose. Not kind, not wise, not skilled — real. The quality of someone whose existence was not performance, whose interactions were not calculated, whose presence was the un-curated version of a person, and the un-curatedness was what Wei valued because Wei's life had been lived in the proximity of a being whose every word was curated. Their curation was invisible. Their invisibility was its own form of dishonesty.

"Das Essen ist gut," I said. His rice. His vegetables. His overpriced pork. The compliment was deliberate and the precision intentional because targeted compliments were the ones that Wei trusted and trust was the currency I was trying to maintain and maintaining required deposits of honesty and honesty about rice was the most reliable denomination.

He tried not to smile. Failed. The failure was small and bright and entirely adequate.

After dinner. Dishes. The domestic ritual of cleanup — water, cloth, the physical labor of restoring a kitchen to its pre-meal state, which was a form of optimism because the restoration implied future meals and future meals implied a future and a future was the thing I couldn't promise and was building anyway.

Wei worked on a technique. The third sequence — the one he'd modified. He practiced the modification while I washed, his hands forming the positions in miniature, the desk-sized version of a full-body form, the rehearsal that happened in the space between intention and execution.

"Why won't you just tell me if the angle is right?" he asked.

I rinsed a bowl. Set it down. "Find it yourself."

"Why do you always—"

"If I solve everything, he never learns."

The words came out — not as instruction, not as philosophy. As thought. The kind of sentence that escaped through the door that attention left open, that arrived in the shared air without having been formally invited, that was more honest for being unplanned and more dangerous for being honest.

I heard myself say it. The sentence's shape in the room — the shape of a principle that sounded like wisdom and was actually fear. Sounded like pedagogy and was actually avoidance. Sounded like a teacher's method and was actually a being's defense against the terror of caring too much about someone whose care required proximity. Their proximity required staying. Their staying was the thing I had never done, not once, not in four thousand years, not since the pattern was established and the pattern was: leave before the loss, leave before the attachment becomes a liability, leave before the staying kills them.

*And if he never learns, he dies the first time I'm not there.*

The inner follow-up. The corollary that justified the principle. Not spoken — thought. The thought that made the principle not cold but logical, not distant but protective, not avoidance but foresight.

Except that foresight required knowing what was being forestalled. And what was being forestalled was the conversation, the admission, the truth about what I was and what my presence did and what the "never learning" was actually about, which was not about techniques and not about independence but about the distance I maintained between my care and its expression because the expression was the vulnerability and the vulnerability was the crack and the crack was where everything had always broken, every time, in every century, with every person I'd ever allowed to matter.

Wei found the angle. Himself. That evening. Alone.

I sat in the doorway. Tea. Stars. The settlement sleeping around us.

He'd found it himself. That was the goal. That was always the goal. That was the sentence I repeated to myself with the regularity of someone reciting a prayer that they weren't sure they believed but whose recitation was the only alternative to the silence and the silence was the thing that came after the prayer stopped working and the stopping was—

The tea was cold.

It didn't matter.
