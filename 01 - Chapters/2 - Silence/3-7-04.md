# Chapter 57

The rain continued.

I walked. Brown behind me. Green ahead. The brute mechanics of locomotion that required no participation beyond the mechanical — legs, joints, the biomechanical repetition of forward movement that occurred because the body defaulted to forward when standing still was too close to the other kind of still.

Trees. Large. Their canopies absorbing the rain and releasing it in filtered portions. Their trunks: solid, barked, the vertical architecture of organisms that survived by standing. Their standing was their method.

In my radius: weakened. Not dead — the trees were too old, too rooted, too invested in their location to die from exposure. But weakened. Leaves sagging. Bark drier. The capillary tension in the wood: reduced, the telltale symptom of biological stress produced by my proximity.

I walked past them. The weakening: temporary. Behind me, past the brown-grass trail, the trees would recover. The leaves would straighten. The bark would rehydrate. The biological resilience of old growth: enough. They would survive me.

He didn't.

The thought sat there. Not new. Not arriving. Just: there. The way a stone was there in a field — present, obvious, requiring no delivery because it had always been in that position and the position was: permanent.

He didn't survive me.

Not my qi. Not my emission. Not the verdorren-radius that killed grass and dropped insects. He didn't survive the other thing — the thing that was not my power but my pattern. The pattern of attachment and loss and the familiar sequence that began with "I will not attach" and ended with "he is dead". Their ending was the thing that the beginning had been designed to prevent. Their prevention had failed because prevention required non-attachment and non-attachment was the lie.

The rain lessened. Drizzle. The kind that hung in the air rather than fell — suspension rather than precipitation, the water molecules uncertain about their commitment to gravity.

I walked. Through the drizzle. Through the forest. Brown underfoot.

No destination. No plan. No thought that constituted planning or destination or the forward-looking architecture that living required. Just: movement. The body moving because the body moved.

Hours. Or a period of time that had the characteristics of hours — changing light, changing temperature, the slow rotation of atmospheric conditions that suggested the planet continued its operations regardless.

The planet did continue. That was the thing about planets. They continued. The rain fell, the trees stood, the grass grew where I was not. The fundamental indifference of a world that was not indifferent but was also not interested in the private grief of a lone woman walking a narrow trail of dead vegetation through an unnamed forest on an unremarkable grey day.

The world held. The world continued. The world did not care.

And the not-caring was the architecture of the world.

And the architecture was the thing I lived in.

And the living was the thing I could not stop.
