# Chapter 37

Morning. Before Wei.

I stood outside. The air: different. Not the qi-heavy wrongness of the destabilization — that was repaired, that was Wei's victory. This was different. The quality of atmosphere that existed when trained beings occupied space with the intention of not being noticed and whose effort at concealment produced a signature that was the opposite of its intention: louder, to anyone who could hear.

Three qi-signatures. At the tree line. Northeast.

Dampened. Disciplined. Professional. The compression of cultivators trained to suppress their presence — effective against most detection. Ineffective against mine.

Formation: triangle. Three-point surveillance — overlapping coverage, no gaps. Textbook. Not individuals. A system. Not curious — professional.

Iron Lotus. Not the individuals but the method — the doctrine of positioning that the Iron Lotus employed and that I had been cataloguing since Shen Liang. Scouts. Organized.

Not recruiters. Recruiters worked alone, approached openly, smiled. These maintained distance. These observed. These gathered intelligence.

Hunters.

The accurate word. Not people who wanted Wei — people who wanted to acquire Wei. The distinction between desire and strategy, and strategy being the thing that produced triangle formations at tree lines before dawn.

Wei came outside. Stretching. The morning routine of someone whose body was a joy to inhabit and whose inhabiting was unconscious.

"Something wrong?" He'd caught the direction of my gaze. Or caught nothing — asked because asking was reflex.

"Tea's cold."

"It's always cold." He grinned. "Make it hot for once."

"Where's the sport in that."

He laughed. Went to the clearing to train.

I drank my tea. Didn't look toward the tree line. Didn't need to — my perception operated without visual input, requiring neither line of sight nor attention.

I catalogued.

Position one: northeast, forty meters. Male, Foundation stage, mid-twenties. His suppression leaked at the lower frequencies — his qi humming beneath the dampening like a heartbeat through a wall.

Position two: east-northeast, sixty meters. Female, possibly Inner Disciple level. Better suppression. She had been doing this longer.

Position three: north, thirty-five meters. Unknown level. Unknown gender. The suppression was exquisite — almost nothing leaked. Very skilled.

Three hunters. Watching. Mapping. Preparing.

For what.

The answer was in the clearing, training. The answer was the boy whose qi-signature was a signal and whose signal had been transmitted on jade and whose jade had produced: the triangle at the tree line.

Not today. Scouts acted when scouting was complete. Days, probably. Maybe a week. The patience of an operation authorized by a hierarchy, and hierarchies moved at the speed of meetings.

But soon.

I drank my tea. Watched the sunrise. Watched the garden — three pots, recovering, the dock grass nearly vertical again.

Said nothing. To no one.

The air tasted the way it always tasted when there were hunters in it. I had tea and three signatures and a boy training in a clearing and the distance between these things was measured in meters and the meters were insufficient.

<!-- Edit Notes:
CHANGES MADE:
1. [CRITICAL] Added 4 dialog exchanges (chapter had ZERO): "Something wrong?" / "Tea's cold." / "It's always cold. Make it hot for once." / "Where's the sport in that." — natural, character-appropriate, adds humor (comedic ratio restoration)
2. [HIGH] E:R ratio improved ~20:80 → ~45:55: cut cascades throughout (atmosphere, formation, hunters, cataloguing, timeline)
3. [HIGH] Deleted 5× "specific" tic (quality, compression, tactical, doctrine, patience)
4. [HIGH] Fixed modern register: "qi-sensing that was my oldest function" → simplified; "bass note" → "humming"
5. [MED] Broke 10+ "whose" chains
6. PRESERVED: Three signatures (triangle formation), Iron Lotus identification, hunter vs. recruiter distinction, three positions catalogued, jade-signal connection, "meters were insufficient" ending
