# Chapter 8

Night.

Wei slept. The sleep of exhaustion earned honestly — through training, cooking, existing at the velocity that fourteen demanded and that fourteen delivered, the RPM of a body that spent its days fully and then stopped fully and whose stopping was immediate, total, the switch-off of a system that didn't do gradual.

I sat. The nightly arrangement. My back against the wall, his breathing as the room's only sound, the particular silence of a house at night that was different from the silence of a road at night because a house's silence was contained, bounded, intimate in the way that walls made intimacy possible by making escape impossible, and I was not escaping, I was sitting, and sitting was the choice and the choice was staying and staying was still new enough to feel deliberate.

Midnight. Or near it. The time that existed not on clocks but in the quality of darkness — the depth of it, the commitment to it, the particular shade of black that said: the sun is as far away as it will get, and the distance is the point.

His core.

I felt it before I saw it. The shift in the ambient qi — subtle, the kind of sub-threshold fluctuation that normal perception missed and that my perception catalogued because my perception catalogued everything and cataloguing was my function or my curse and the distinction between the two had become academic.

Then: light.

Through his shirt. Through the fabric that covered his chest, through the threads and the weave and the material that was supposed to be opaque and that was opaque to sunlight and candlelight and firelight but not to this, not to the frequency of luminescence that qi produced when it exceeded the body's capacity to contain it and the excess expressed itself in the only medium available, which was light, which was photons, which was physics.

Warm. Golden. The color of late afternoon compressed into a point source and emitted from the sternum of a sleeping boy who didn't know he was a lantern.

I stood. Crossed the room. Two steps — the house was small, the rooms were small, the distances were domestic. Knelt beside him.

His face in the light: peaceful. The peace of someone who was unaware of the broadcast they were producing, whose unawareness was the condition of the broadcast because awareness brought control and control brought suppression and suppression brought the daytime version of Wei, the version that had learned to dampen and compress and contain, the version that was a performance of normalcy and whose performance was increasingly expensive and whose expense was visible in the tremor and the nosebleeds and the other currencies that his body was paying in exchange for the privilege of appearing stable.

This — the nighttime version — was what he was. Unperformed. Uncontained. The core broadcasting at its natural amplitude, which was an amplitude that had no business existing in a fourteen-year-old body, that corresponded to cultivation levels three stages above his and that was continuing to grow at a rate that defied the trajectory models I'd been running since the mountains.

I placed my hand above his chest. Not touching — hovering. Two centimeters. The space between my palm and his sternum filled with the warm pressure of qi that was dense enough to feel like a physical substance, like water, like the viscosity of something between liquid and light.

Beautiful.

The word that kept arriving. The word that I kept using for things that were also terrifying and whose terror was not diminished by the beauty but amplified by it because beauty in the context of danger was the aesthetic of things that were about to end, the sunset quality of phenomena that were brilliant because they were unsustainable and unsustainable because they were brilliant.

Three twitches per minute.

I counted. The way I counted everything — automatically, clinically, with the detachment that wasn't detachment but a mechanism for converting experience into data because data was manageable and experience was not.

Three. Per minute. His core — pulsing, glowing, broadcasting — stuttered three times in every sixty-second interval. The stutter was the instability made rhythmic, the structural flaw expressed as pattern, the crack in the glass made audible as a tick-tick-tick that was not sound but qi-fluctuation and that was not dangerous in isolation but was dangerous in trend because yesterday had been two.

Two. Yesterday: two. Today: three. The arithmetic was simple. The arithmetic was terrible. The arithmetic said: this is a function with a slope and the slope is positive and the positive is the problem and the problem is the boy and the boy is glowing and the glowing is beautiful and the beautiful is the prelude and the prelude is—

I withdrew my hand. Pulled his blanket higher. Tucked it around his shoulders — the, ordinary gesture of a caretaker adjusting bedding, the gesture that was care in its most physical form, that was the body's way of saying: I am here, you are warm, the covering is intact. The gesture that I performed not because he was cold but because performing it was the only action available that wasn't the other action, which was the action of telling him, of waking him, of saying: your core is flickering and the flickering is worsening and the worsening is the shape of a trajectory whose endpoint I have seen before and whose endpoint is—

I went outside.

The moon. Half-full. Committed to partial illumination with the economy of a light source that understood that sometimes half was sufficient and that sufficiency was its own completeness.

The garden. Three pots in a row. The dock grass, dark in the moonlight, thriving with the vitality of a wrong plant that didn't know it was wrong and whose not-knowing was its defense. The nettle-cousin, producing something vertical that might have been hope or might have been a structural anomaly. The lemongrass, being lemongrass.

The blade fragment caught the moonlight. A thin line of reflected silver on the wall, the metallic echo of a boy who brought gifts from a swordsmith's workshop and placed them among plants and stones and called it a garden.

I stood. Drank tea that was cold because all my tea was cold because cold tea was the consistent outcome of a being who held a cup and forgot to drink and the forgetting was not absent-mindedness but absorption and the absorption was the boy inside and the inside was the place where the light was and the light was the problem.

Three twitches per minute.

*That is—*

I didn't finish. The thought. The sentence. The calculation. Not because I didn't know the end but because knowing it and speaking it were different acts and different acts had different consequences and the consequence of speaking it was making it real and real was a territory I was not prepared to enter tonight in this garden with this moon and this tea.

I stood. Watched the moon commit to its arc. Watched the settlement sleep. Watched the garden exist — the small, wrong, beautiful garden that was Wei's project and whose project-ness was its meaning and whose meaning was the thing I was holding in the space where the finished thought should have been.

Inside, the light faded. His core settled. The broadcast quieted. The boy slept.

I stayed.
