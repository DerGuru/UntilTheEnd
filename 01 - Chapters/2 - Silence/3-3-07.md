# Chapter 26

On the path back, the woodcutter.

A sound from the undergrowth — not the anti-sound of a predator, the opposite. Human sound. The vocalization of pain that was too exhausted for screaming and had settled into the lower register of sustained distress. A moan. Continuous. The soundtrack of someone who had been hurting for long enough that the hurting had become background.

Wei stopped.

I watched the stopping. The kinematics of it — his body arrested mid-stride, his weight shifting to the balls of his feet, his head turning toward the sound with the speed of a radar dish locking. Automatic. Total. The response of someone whose wiring included a circuit that connected the-sound-of-pain to the-action-of-response. Their circuit was hardwired. Their hardwiring was—

Him. This was him. Not my training. Not conditioning. Not the product of years of instruction in combat or cultivation or the physics of survival. This was the substrate, the base layer, the thing that Wei was before Wei was anything else: someone who heard pain and moved toward it.

He was already running.

"Wei—"

Gone. Into the undergrowth. Toward the sound. No assessment, no pause, no calculation of risk vs. probable outcome vs. resource expenditure. Just: someone is hurt, I go.

I followed. Fast. The following that was reflex and also data collection — scanning the undergrowth for threats, feeling the qi-field for anomalies, performing the tactical assessment that he hadn't performed. Their not-performing was the gap and the gap was the thing I filled.

The woodcutter.

An older man. Fifties, maybe. His leg: pinned under a fallen tree — not a large tree, but large enough. The trunk across his lower leg at an angle that said: broken. Probably. The geometry of wood-on-bone that produced fracture rather than bruise.

His face: grey with pain. Sweat. Eyes: wide, desperate, the look of someone who had been here for hours. Their hours had accumulated into fear. Their fear was the sound and the sound was what Wei had heard.

Wei was already at the tree.

"Hold still," he said. The command voice. Not learned — inherited. The authority of someone who was fourteen and had been in danger. Their danger-experience produced confidence. Their confidence produced the calm that others needed and the others were this man and the man needed and Wei provided.

He channeled qi into his arms. Not refined, not elegant — the raw amplification that enhanced strength beyond what muscle alone could produce. He gripped the trunk. Lifted. The tree moved — not much, but enough. Enough for the leg to be free, for the angle to change, for the pressure to release.

The woodcutter groaned. The groan of pain-changing-form — from the constant pressure of entrapment to the sharp, bright acknowledgment of release. Better and worse simultaneously.

Wei pulled him free. Carefully — the careful of someone who understood that movement was dangerous and that dangerous required attention and that attention was what he was providing, fully, totally, with the single-minded focus that was his register and that was activated by: someone needs help, I am here.

"Your leg." Wei assessed. Not medical assessment — field assessment. The visual data of someone who had seen injuries and treated injuries. Their treatment was improvisation. Their improvisation was: branches for a splint, fabric torn from his own shirt for binding, the compression wrap that I had shown him once and that he now executed from memory with the accuracy of someone who learned by seeing once and doing forever.

He splinted the leg. Not perfectly — the angle was eight degrees off optimal, the binding was tight in one place and loose in another. But functional. Sufficient. The work of hands that were competent and getting more competent. Their trajectory was—

Wei lifted the man. Supported him. Shoulder under arm — his right shoulder, because his left had a new scar and the scar was thirty minutes old and the thirty minutes was not enough time for the body to forget and the body's not-forgetting was the wince that Wei didn't show.

"Of course you help," Wei said. To nobody. To the forest. To the principle that existed in him beneath the training and the cultivation and the fighting — the principle that said: this is what you do when someone is hurt. You help. It's not heroism. It's not choice. It's reflex. The reflex is who you are.

They walked toward the settlement. Slowly. The woodcutter leaning on Wei. Wei: steady, patient, bearing weight with the endurance of someone who had just fought a qi-beast and been clawed and been healed and was now carrying a man twice his weight and the carrying was natural and the natural was him.

I followed. Behind. The position of observation.

*Of course you help.*

The sentence. His sentence. The one that described the architecture of his character — the fundamental, structural, load-bearing truth about who Wei was and what Wei did when the world presented him with pain that wasn't his and the pain-not-being-his being irrelevant because relevance was the category he'd abolished and the abolishing was the thing and the thing was: this boy could not not help.

Could not not.

The double negative that was the positive. The grammar of compulsion that said: the option of not-helping was not an option. Was not in his vocabulary. Was not wired into his system because his system's wiring was: hear pain, move toward pain, address pain. Always. Regardless. Without exception.

I watched him carry the woodcutter. Thought about the lynx. Thought about the grin. Thought about the warmth in his sternum and the two-second breath-stop and the word he'd used — tired — and the word I would have used — beginning.

And I thought about how the thing that made him beautiful was the thing that made him vulnerable.

And how the thing that made him vulnerable was the thing that would—

I didn't finish.

We walked home.
