# Chapter 25

I healed his shoulder.

The process: routine. Qi applied to damaged tissue, the cellular encouragement that accelerated what the body would do anyway — knit, seal, rebuild. My qi was old and efficient and his body was young and responsive and the combination produced healing that was fast and clean and that left a scar because scars were the only honest record of what had happened and honesty was not something I was willing to suppress even when suppressing it was technically possible.

He sat on a rock. Patient — the patience of someone whose adrenaline was receding and whose receding was the exhaustion and the exhaustion replacing the triumph and the replacement being the sequence and the sequence being how bodies worked: fight, win, crash.

The wound closed. The scar formed — a diagonal line from the top of his left shoulder to the crease of his elbow. Pale, thin, the quality of a healed wound that had been closed by qi rather than by time and whose qi-closure was visible as precision that natural healing couldn't achieve.

He touched it. Ran his finger along the line. The assessment of someone cataloguing a new feature of their body.

"Scars are cool," he said.

The statement that was simultaneously juvenile and sincere and that I could not argue with because arguing with sincerity was cruelty and cruelty was not the project.

"They're tissue damage."

"Cool tissue damage."

I finished. Stepped back. His shoulder: healed. His core: humming. The hum that was the post-combat resonance of qi that had been deployed at maximum and was now resettling, recalibrating, returning to the amplitude that was his new normal and whose new-normal was higher than the old normal and the higher was the trajectory and the trajectory was the clock and the clock was ticking.

His grin. Still there. Dimmer — exhaustion muted it — but present, persistent, the grin that attached to victory and didn't detach until sleep and sleep was hours away and the hours would be filled with the grin and the retelling and the embellishment.

I watched him. Standing in the clearing. Fourteen. Blood-smeared. Scarred. Victorious. Grinning.

And I saw through him.

Not metaphorically. The perceptual phenomenon that years produced — the layering of visual input with historical data, the overlay that happened when you looked at someone and saw not only them but also all the others who had looked like them in the moment that they were currently occupying.

Another face.

Before. A long time before — the distance that said: I have forgotten the exact number and the forgetting is the mercy and the mercy is the only thing that makes duration survivable.

A fighter. Young. Strong. Not Wei — different name, different face, different era, different everything except the one thing that was the same, which was: this. The post-victory moment. The blood. The grin. The standing-in-a-clearing quality of someone who had won their first real fight and whose winning was the beginning and the beginning was the sentence that I needed to not finish.

He won. That fighter. Not against a qi-beast — against another cultivator. Higher level, more experienced, the kind of opponent that probability said he should have lost to. He didn't lose. He stood in the aftermath with the same expression that Wei was wearing now — the undefeatable certainty of someone who had discovered their own capacity and whose discovery was the drug and the drug was the confidence and the confidence was the fuel and the fuel was the fire.

His grin looked the same.

His core had done the same thing — the post-combat surge, the brightness, the warmth that he'd dismissed as exertion and that wasn't exertion and that was instead the first syllable of a word that took three weeks to finish saying and the word was: overload.

Three weeks. That's how long it took. From the first victory to the second fight. Three weeks of training harder, pushing further, riding the high of having won and the high being the acceleration and the acceleration being the trajectory and the trajectory being the ceiling and the ceiling being the place where—

He'd won the second fight too. Technically. In the sense that the other fighter fell first. But winning was a category with subcategories and one of the subcategories was: the cost. And the cost of his second win was the core. The core that had been running hot, running bright, running beyond its containment parameters since the first victory and whose running produced a cascade and the cascade produced the failure and the failure—

*He also won. Then—*

I stopped. The thought. The sentence. The memory. Mid-word, mid-image, mid-whatever it was that was happening in the space between past and present that I occupied more frequently than was healthy and whose frequency was the sentence and the sentence was: this has happened before.

Wei stretched. Flexed his healed shoulder. Grinned at me.

"Ready to go?" he asked.

I looked at him. Not through him — at him. The discipline of present-tense looking, of seeing the boy who was here instead of the boy who was not here, of choosing the current over the remembered and the choosing being the effort and the effort being visible nowhere because visibility was not how I operated.

"Ready," I said.

We walked. Through the forest. Past the stream. Toward the settlement. Him ahead — three steps, four steps, the distance growing as his energy returned and his energy returned as his grin returned and his grin returned as the victory solidified from experience into narrative and the narrative was: I fought a rock lynx and I won and the winning is who I am.

Behind him: me. With the memory of someone else's grin. Someone else's victory. Someone else's three weeks.

*Wei is different. Wei is stubborn. Wei survives.*

*He has to be different.*
