# Chapter 27

Heiler Mao arrived at dusk.

He came because he always came when someone returned from the forest injured, because the settlement's information network was Frau Huang and Frau Huang's network was sound — she heard everything, relayed everything, and her relaying was the journalism of someone for whom news was a public service and public service was volume.

Mao was old. Older than Lao Chen, though they disagreed about by how much. His hands: steady, despite the age. His qi-sensitivity: rudimentary — the kind that came not from cultivation but from decades of proximity to the qi-rich environment of the valley, the osmotic absorption that ordinary people experienced when they lived near enough to cultivators for long enough. He couldn't channel. He couldn't fight. He could feel. And feeling was enough for his purposes, which were: broken bones, fevers, herbs, poultice, the medicine of the body rather than the spirit.

He examined the woodcutter first. Set the leg properly — eight degrees corrected, binding tightened. Professional. The competence of repetition that looked like talent but was actually the accumulated evidence of having seen six hundred broken legs and having set five hundred and ninety-eight of them correctly.

Then he came to Wei.

"Heard you fought something," he said. Understated. The understatement of a healer who had heard Frau Huang's version, which had involved a beast the size of a horse and a fight lasting an hour, and who had performed the necessary division to arrive at something closer to truth.

"Rock lynx," Wei said. Grinning. Still grinning. The grin that was the permanent fixture of post-victory Wei and that would remain permanent until sleep and that was currently being directed at a healer whose concern was medical and whose medical was the point.

Mao put his hands on Wei's chest. Closed his eyes. The diagnostic posture — palms flat, fingers spread, the maximum-contact configuration that his rudimentary sensitivity required in order to feel what more advanced practitioners could feel from across a room.

He felt.

His brow furrowed. The furrow of someone encountering something that was partly familiar and partly not — the known layered with the unknown, the pattern that was recognizable in its components but alien in its composition.

"Your core is... bright."

He said it carefully. The way you said something you weren't sure about — the tentative delivery of an observation that might be wrong and whose wrongness would be embarrassing but whose rightness would be concerning and whose concerning was the alternative to embarrassment and the alternative was worse.

"Bright?" Wei asked.

"More than I'd expect. For—" Mao waved vaguely. For your age, for your level, for whatever taxonomy he was using that didn't have precise enough categories for what he was feeling.

"Too bright?" Wei asked. Not worried. Curious. The curiosity of someone for whom more was an achievement and achievements were positive and positive was the only valence he recognized.

Mao paused. The pause of clinical uncertainty — the diagnostic moment where data was insufficient for conclusion and the insufficiency was the gap and the gap was his limitation and his limitation was: village healer, not core specialist.

"No. Just — different."

He withdrew his hands. Tapped his chin. The habitual gesture — the chin-tap that I'd seen four times now and that was the physical expression of processing in progress and processing incomplete.

"Rest, boy. And drink more water."

The prescription of someone whose therapeutic vocabulary didn't extend to: your qi-core is producing output that exceeds your physical containment parameters and the exceedance is progressive and the progression is measurable and the measurement says something I don't have the training to articulate and the inarticulation is my failing and my failing is your risk.

He didn't know what he'd felt. Not specifically. He'd felt wrongness — the, subsonic, intuitive detection that came from thirty years of putting his hands on bodies and feeling what bodies were supposed to feel like and this not feeling like supposed-to. But the wrongness had no name in his vocabulary. No category. No protocol.

He left. Chin-tapping. Internally uneasy — the unease that produced nothing because nothing was what his skills offered for this flavor of wrongness.

Wei shrugged. "He always says drink water."

"Water is important."

"You sound like him."

I didn't respond to that. Because responding would have required choosing between: Yes, water is important, or: What Mao felt in your core is the beginning of a degenerative cascade that will accelerate with every combat deployment and that manifests initially as warmth and prickling and two-second respiratory arrests and that progresses through a symptom tree that I have memorized and that I could recite from memory and that I will not recite because reciting is telling and telling is directing and directing is—

Wei went to his room. To rest. To drink water. To grin in the privacy of his bed about the lynx he'd defeated and the scar he now owned.

I stood in the kitchen. Processing.

What I had seen. During Mao's examination. While his rudimentary hands were on Wei's chest and his rudimentary sensitivity was detecting brightness — I had been seeing something else. Something beneath Mao's perception. Something beneath most perceptions.

Wei's core. Visible to me in the qi-spectrum that my senses accessed and that normal cultivators accessed partially and that healers accessed tangentially. Visible and — wrong.

Four twitches per minute. The count confirmed. Up from three. The escalation consistent, gradual, the pace that said: this is chronic, not acute. This is the long game. This is the trajectory.

And: the pattern.

His core's luminescence — the golden light that I'd been watching for weeks, the glow that pushed through his shirt at night, the brightness that Mao had felt and named — was organizing. Not randomly, not in the chaotic distribution that normal qi-fluctuation produced. In a pattern. A spiral.

The light moving in a spiral. From the core's center outward, tracing a curve that was mathematical, precise, the geometry of something that was designed rather than emergent and whose design—

I stopped. Looked at it. The spiral.

It could be nothing. Qi did strange things in young cores. Patterns emerged and dissolved and emerged again and the emerging was natural variance and natural variance was the explanation that required the fewest assumptions.

Or it could be something.

The spiral. Moving. Slow. Like writing. Like text that was too small to read and too persistent to ignore and too ambiguous to interpret and the ambiguity being the—

I turned away. Poured tea. Let it go cold.

Some things I could not identify because identifying them required a context I was not willing to supply and the context was the frame and the frame was the thing I had stepped out of and stepping back in was not an option.

The spiral continued. In his core. In his sleep. In the room where he grinned and rested and drank water and was fourteen and was bright and was mine.

The spiral continued.
