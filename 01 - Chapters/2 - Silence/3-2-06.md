# Chapter 15

Two days passed. Wei didn't mention the Iron Lotus. Didn't mention Shen Liang. Trained, cooked, went to Lao Chen's, came back with metal dust in his hair and questions about tempering techniques that I answered with the minimal information required and the minimal being the protocol and the protocol being: enough to be useful, not enough to be directive.

On the third day, he mentioned it.

He came in from training. Stood in the kitchen — the standing that preceded the saying, the posture of someone assembling a speech. Their assembly was visible in the set of his shoulders and the way his hands found nothing to do with themselves and so hung at his sides in the uselessness of hands that wanted to be occupied and were not.

"I've been thinking about it."

I knew what it was. It was the only it in the room.

"About the sect."

I put down my tea. Not because putting it down was necessary — I could have held it, could have drunk from it, could have used it as the prop that tea served in conversations that were difficult. Their difficulty was measured in the number of sips that weren't really sips but time-purchases between statements. I put it down because putting it down was the physical act of giving him my attention and my attention was the thing he'd asked for and asking was rare and rare deserved the cup on the table.

"I want to know what you think," he said.

The same request as two days ago. Re-presented. Because the first response — the technical feedback, the seventh-form correction, the deflection that deflected — had been audible as a deflection and he was fourteen and fourteen was old enough to hear deflection and young enough to insist on trying again.

I looked at him. Brown eyes. The morning light on his face — the same face from the doorway, the same face from the market, the same face from every morning for three months in this settlement and for years before this settlement and for the period before the years that I was not thinking about because thinking about it activated the frame and the frame was the thing I had abandoned.

"If you want to go," I said, "go."

The words left. Clean. Simple. Five words. Five syllables that contained enough emotional material to sustain a lesser being for weeks and that I delivered with the flatness that was my register. Their register was the defense and the defense was necessary because the alternative was the tremor and the tremor was the thing I did not permit.

He looked at me. The looking that was reading. The reading that was accurate.

"That's not advice."

"No."

"What is it?"

I paused. The pause that was genuine — not theatrical, not strategic, the actual pause of someone searching for the honest answer. Their search was complicated by the fact that the honest answer had multiple layers and the layers were contradictory and contractions were the substance of this and this was the dilemma and the dilemma was the core.

"Respect."

He blinked.

"Respect?"

"For your judgment. You're fourteen. You've survived more than most adults. You're capable of making this decision."

He studied me. The study of someone parsing a response for subtext and finding it and finding more of it than they'd expected and the expectation gap being the space where the real conversation was happening.

"You don't want me to go."

Statement. Not question. He was sure.

I said nothing. Nothing was the honest response — more honest than yes, more honest than no, the truthfulness of silence that said: what I want is irrelevant to what I'm offering you and the irrelevance is the sacrifice and the sacrifice is mine.

"But you're not going to say that," he continued.

"No."

"Because it would be — what? Controlling?"

He understood. Better than I'd expected. The understanding of someone who had been watching me watch him. Their watching-of-my-watching was a skill and the skill was his and his was the insight and the insight was: she won't tell me what to do because telling me what to do is the thing she's most afraid of.

Not the most afraid of. The most afraid of was him dying. But the second most afraid of was him living and living as someone whose living was her construction. Their construction was a cage with good intentions.

"It would be unfair," I said.

"To whom?"

"To you."

He stood there. In the kitchen. Morning light. The gouge in the table. The chrysanthemum — still in its paper bag on the counter, still unused, the physical evidence of a market visit that had produced a recruiter and a recognition and a pronoun-shaped wound and a bag of flowers I didn't want.

"Okay," he said.

"Okay."

He went outside. Back to training. The forms, the transitions, the hip correction that was his and that Shen Liang had named and that I had taught without naming because not-naming was my method and my method was the thing that had both produced him and left space for someone else to fill and the someone else was the recruiter and the recruiter was the gap and the gap was the cost.

I sat. Kitchen. Tea — cold. The word I'd used: respect.

The word I meant: fear.

But fear and respect lived in the same house. And the house was the gamble. And the gamble was what I was doing — letting him choose, letting him walk, letting him be the agent of his own life and the agency being the principle and the principle being the thing I held when I couldn't hold him.

Respect. Fear. The same house.

The tea was cold. The cup was warm from my hands.
