# Chapter 1

We found a house.

Not a good house — the category didn't apply. A house. Four walls, two rooms, a roof that committed to its function with the enthusiasm of someone performing a job they'd held too long. The door stuck. Wei fixed it three times. It stuck three times. They were in a relationship now — the door and Wei — and the relationship was adversarial and ongoing and neither party showed signs of yielding.

The settlement was small. Thirty houses, a market, a well. Mountains to the north — the same mountains we'd descended from, which felt like meeting an acquaintance in a different context and discovering they looked entirely different from the front. Forest to the east, dense, green, the green of trees that hadn't been asked to be symmetrical and were thriving in the absence of the request. The nearest sect territory was three valleys away — close enough for trade, far enough for breathing. The geography of acceptable risk.

We'd been here — how long? A month. Maybe six weeks. Long enough for the word "here" to shift from "this place we're at" to "home," and the shift happened without announcement, without negotiation, the way shifts happen when people stop moving and the stopping becomes its own momentum.

Morning. The morning I'm thinking of, the one that represents all the mornings because all the mornings were the same and the sameness was the gift and I didn't know it was a gift until it stopped being given.

Wei trained. Outside. Barefoot on the packed earth of what we'd designated the yard, which was a generous term for the patch of ground between our door and the neighbor's fence. His qi flowed — clean, fast, controlled. His movements were no longer a child's. He was fourteen. His body was catching up to his cultivation in the way that bodies catch up, which was to say unevenly, in spurts, with the awkwardness of a structure being renovated while still occupied.

I stood in the doorway. Tea in my hand. Watching.

This was our morning. This had become our morning. The arrangement was — comfortable. The word felt dangerous, the way all words felt dangerous that implied continuity, that assumed a tomorrow identical to today, that trusted the universe to maintain a pattern, and the universe did not maintain patterns, the universe disrupted patterns, the universe viewed patterns the way cats viewed arrangements of objects on shelves — as invitations.

But. This morning. Tea. Doorway. Wei training. The sun on the yard. The sound of the settlement waking around us — chickens with opinions, a hammer somewhere, a woman calling for someone who wasn't answering.

The garden.

Wei had planted a garden. Three herbs in clay pots, arranged along the south-facing wall with the care of someone who believed that arrangement mattered and that mattering was a property of attention and that attention was what turned a patch of dirt into a project.

Two of the three were wrong. He'd planted weeds — specifically, a variant of dock grass and something that might have been wild nettle absent the defining characteristics that distinguished nettle from its useless cousin. He'd mistaken them for healing herbs. The identification process had involved confidence, enthusiasm, and the notable absence of reference materials.

The third plant was actually a herb. Lemongrass. By accident. The kind of accident that happened when someone collected everything with a green stem and statistical probability did the rest.

I hadn't told him. He watered all three with equal care. Mornings, evenings. The wrong plants received the same attention as the right one — the same measured pour, the same careful adjustment of the pot's position to track the sun.

That was Wei. Everything or nothing. Even the weeds got water.

After training, he disappeared. Not dramatically — functionally. The way fourteen-year-olds disappear, which is to say into the vicinity of the nearest person who isn't their parent or guardian or ancient being of indeterminate nature, seeking the nourishment that came from adult attention that wasn't teaching and wasn't watching and was simply existing alongside.

The Blade Whisperer. That was my name for him — the old swordsmith three houses down whose actual name was Lao Chen but whose defining characteristic was the relationship he had with metal, which was intimate, communicative, and slightly concerning.

His workshop was small. Dark. Full of the smell that metal produced when it was being attended to — oil, heat, the chemical conversation between stone and steel. He sharpened blades. Repaired tools. Talked to the swords the way other people talked to pets — with endearments, encouragement, and the occasional gentle reproof.

"Every sword has a voice," he told Wei. I heard it through the window — the old man's voice, creaked at the hinges, warm where it mattered. "Yours is too loud, boy."

He didn't have a sword. Lao Chen was speaking metaphorically — or diagnostically, in the way that craftsmen diagnosed things beyond their stated domain because they understood materials and Wei was a material and the material had a resonance and the resonance was audible to anyone who listened the right way.

He showed Wei how to sharpen a blade. Not with force — with patience. The angle, the pressure, the rhythm of stone on steel that was a conversation rather than an assault. Wei listened. For once — quiet. Attentive. The particular attention of someone who had found a person worth listening to. Their worth had nothing to do with power and everything to do with presence.

I watched through the window. A normal boy with a normal man. A workshop. Metal. Patience. The ordinary transaction of knowledge from old hands to young ones, the oldest teaching method, the one that worked not through instruction but through proximity.

I could never have been that. The thought arrived without self-pity — categorically, the way facts arrive. I was not a normal person. I was not the kind of being that a fourteen-year-old boy sat with in a workshop and learned patience from, because my patience was geological and his need was human and the two operated on different timescales and the difference was the gap that I couldn't cross and Lao Chen could and the crossing was the gift and the gift was ordinary and ordinary gifts were the best kind because they didn't know they were gifts and therefore didn't expect gratitude.

Wei came home for lunch. Brought a piece of metal — a broken blade fragment, palm-sized, polished until the surface reflected.

"For the garden," he said.

"That's a blade fragment."

"For the garden."

He placed it among the pots. Between the dock grass and the lemongrass. A shard of steel in a garden of wrong plants.

I drank my tea. He ate his rice. The door stuck when he closed it. He hit it with his hip — the, practiced motion of someone who had incorporated a structural defect into their daily choreography and who had made the defect a part of the routine and the routine a part of the home and the home a part of the life that was happening here, in this place, in this settlement where we'd stopped moving and the stopping was beginning to feel like staying and staying was beginning to feel like something I hadn't felt in a very long time. Their name I wasn't ready to say.

The sun moved. The shadows shortened. The settlement performed its midday operations. Somewhere, a child laughed. Somewhere else, a chicken lost an argument.

Normal. Absolutely, terrifyingly normal.
