# Chapter 55

I stood up. At some point. Unmarked — no decision, no impulse, no trigger. The body stood because lying was not sustainable and not-sustainable was the body's limit.

The door. Outside. The bowl — cold now, the steam gone, the rice hardened at the surface. I stepped over it. Not around. Over. Someone who did not see the bowl because the bowl was not the thing and the thing was: movement. Any direction. Away.

Past the garden.

His garden. The three pots. My peripheral vision registered them — there, present, green — and peripheral vision was the only vision I permitted for that location. Direct vision was direct engagement. Direct engagement was the thing I was refusing.

I walked.

Through the settlement. Damaged walls on both sides. People — settlers, civilians, survivors — in their doorways, at their windows. Watching something that should not be watched but could not be avoided because the something was walking down their street.

They moved away.

Not dramatically. Not running. The small, instinctive adjustments that bodies made in proximity to something they recognized as wrong — stepping back, pulling children closer, turning sideways. The vocabulary of avoidance that didn't require language.

Under my feet: the grass. Brown. Three paces — the radius, smaller now than the thirty paces of the discharge aftermath but present, persistent. The field of decay that accompanied me as I walked. Each step: brown behind it. Green in front. The trail of someone whose trail was death.

An insect: fell. Mid-flight. In my radius. Dropped from the air the way things dropped when the air itself became hostile. A small thing. Wings still. On the dirt.

Leaves: curling at the edges. On the trees I passed, on the bushes, on the vegetation lining the path out of the settlement. Not dramatic — incremental. The slow wilting that I was producing.

Past the east gate. Past the open ground. Past the place.

I did not look at the place. The dirt where he had lain. Whatever marked it — blood, qi-residue, the evidence of a body that had discharged and fallen and lain. I did not look.

Into the forest. The trees — large, old, the kind that had been growing before this settlement existed and would continue after it forgot itself. Their age was their resistance. Older biology: harder to kill. The grass died in my wake but the trees merely weakened — leaves losing rigidity, bark drying slightly, the subtle symptoms of exposure that would heal when the exposure left.

I walked. No direction. No purpose. The body moving because the body moved and the moving was the alternative to the not-moving. And the not-moving was the house. And the house was the bowl. And the bowl was the empty room.

Away from people. Away from the settlement. Away from the barriers I had built and the signs I had carved and the walls that held. The walls holding was the proof. And the proof was the thing I could not stand because the proof said: you protected everything. And everything was a lie because everything excluded him.

The forest closed behind me. The green — and then the brown path I left. The trail of dead grass and curled leaves that said: someone came this way. And the someone was the thing that killed what she walked through.

I walked.

<!-- Edit Notes:
Part 7 — Walking away / Trail of death (E:R 40:60):
1. [HIGH] Deleted 5× "specific": point, trajectory, positions, field, chemical evidence
2. [HIGH] E:R maintained ~40:60:
   - Standing cascade: cut "the limit produced standing"
   - Bowl cascade: cut "trajectory of someone who did not see" → kept concept shorter
   - Garden cascade: simplified refusal chain
   - Moving cascade: cut "the specific field of decay" → "The field of decay"
   - Bloodstain cascade: cut nested "whose" clause
   - Purpose cascade: broke into shorter sentences ("And the not-moving... And the house... And the bowl...")
   - Proof cascade: broke into shorter sentences for starkness
3. [HIGH] Cut all "whose" chains (except "whose trail was death" — too strong to cut)
4. PRESERVED: Stepping OVER the bowl (not around — CRITICAL behavioral detail), peripheral vision only on garden, brown trail / radius imagery, insect falling (CRITICAL — collateral grief), leaves curling, NOT looking at the place, "older biology: harder to kill" (CRITICAL), "you protected everything. And everything was a lie" (CRITICAL), brown trail ending, "I walked." (CRITICAL one-word ending)
