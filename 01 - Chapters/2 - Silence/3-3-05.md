# Chapter 24

The last exchange.

The lynx charged — lower still, having learned twice, having adapted its approach to the geometry of this opponent who was small and fast and hurt. Their hurt was the opening and the opening was the target.

Wei didn't dodge. Didn't roll. Didn't redirect.

He channeled.

Everything. All of it. The qi that he had been holding in reserve, the stored energy that training and discipline had taught him to maintain as backup, as insurance, as the emergency fund that you didn't touch unless emergency was the situation and the situation was now.

His right hand — palm open, fingers spread — erupted. Golden light. Not the controlled luminescence of a trained technique but the full, unmodulated discharge of a core operating at maximum output without governor, without limit, without the self-imposed ceiling that I had taught him existed for a reason and the reason being: what happens when you breach the ceiling is the information you cannot use because using it means you've already breached and breaching is the territory you cannot return from.

The qi-pulse hit the lynx mid-charge.

The animal — seventy kilos of enhanced predator, qi-lines blazing, teeth extended, committed to the attack with the full investment of a body in flight — stopped. Not decelerated. Stopped. The kinetic energy converted to nothing by the overwhelming force of the pulse, the nullification that happened when qi met qi and one was significantly larger and the significantly larger was Wei's and Wei's was too much.

The lynx flew backward. Three meters, four, five — tumbling, fur rippling, its qi-lines stuttering and failing, the biological body overloaded by the input and the input being the boy and the boy being more than anything in this forest had encountered.

It landed. Hard. On its side in the undergrowth.

For a moment: nothing. The forest held its breath. The birds — silent since the fight began — waited. The stream trickled. The clearing existed in the suspension of time that followed violence and preceded its aftermath.

Then the lynx stood. Slowly. Shakily. Its qi-lines: dim. Its posture: different. The aggression was gone. The territorial certainty was gone. In its place: something I recognized because I had seen it in a thousand animals across a thousand years — the reassessment. The cognitive adjustment that a predator made when it discovered that the hierarchy it had constructed was wrong and the wrong was the boy and the boy was the apex now and the apex was the thing you didn't challenge.

The lynx turned. Walked into the undergrowth. Not running — walking. The dignity of retreat that preserved enough self-narrative to survive on. I had watched sect elders leave failed negotiations with less composure.

Gone.

Wei stood.

Alone. In the center of the clearing. The trampled grass. The displaced earth. The blood — his blood, on his arm, on the ground, on the shredded sleeve.

His left shoulder: open, diagonal, deep. The wound that would scar. That was already scarring, in the sense that scars began at the moment of injury and the injury was the writing and the writing was permanent.

His hands: trembling. Adrenaline. The post-combat vibration of a body that had been operating beyond its nominal parameters and was now returning to baseline and the return was rocky because the baseline had shifted and shifting was the cost.

His face: bloody. Sweat and dirt and the red smear of a hand that had touched his wound and then touched his face and the touching being involuntary, the body's inventory of its own damage.

His expression.

The grin. 

The, radiant, undefeatable grin of a fourteen-year-old boy who had just fought a qi-enhanced rock lynx alone and won. Their winning was the thing and the thing was everything and everything was this moment, here, now, bloody and shaking and victorious.

The blood was still running down his arm. This did not factor into his assessment.

"I did it!"

Loud. At the forest. At the sky. At the stream and the birds and the moss and the trees and at me.

"I DID IT!"

The grin — wider. The grin that was the same grin from every victory and from every morning and from every moment when Wei was Wei and Wei was alive and alive was the state he occupied with the totality that left no room for nuance.

Then—

His breath stopped.

Two seconds. Not a gasp, not a stutter — a full cessation. His chest: immobile. His mouth: open, mid-grin, frozen. His eyes: unchanged, still victorious, still bright, still the eyes of someone who had won and didn't know that the winning had a clause and the clause was in his sternum and the sternum was—

A warmth. I felt it from eight meters — the sudden, internal bloom of heat that originated at his core and radiated outward through his chest, his shoulders, his arms. Not painful. The opposite — warm, pleasant, the sensation of sunshine absorbed and redistributed, of internal summer.

Prickling. On his skin — goosebumps, the body's response to a qi-event that it couldn't categorize. Their categorization was irrelevant because the body's vocabulary for this was limited to: prickling. Which was warm. Which was fine. Which was nothing.

Two seconds. His breath returned.

He blinked. Rubbed his chest — casually, the way you rubbed a stitch, the way you dismissed a hiccup. The gesture of someone who had noticed an anomaly and was filing it under: exertion.

"Just tired," he said. To himself. To the forest. To the grin that was still on his face and that hadn't left because the grin was the structure and the structure was the victory and the victory was the only narrative and narratives were what fourteen-year-olds built from moments like this and this moment's narrative was: I won.

I uncurled my fists. Slowly. The crescents in my palms — eight of them, four per hand, bloody, precise — releasing as my fingers straightened. The taste of iron in my mouth: persistent. The inside of my cheek: raw.

The qi-clock.

It had started. The two-second respiratory arrest, the warmth, the prickling — these were not exertion. These were not fatigue. These were the symptoms of a core whose output was exceeding structural containment at a rate that produced physical overflow and the overflow was the symptom and the symptom was stage one and stage one was the beginning and the beginning was what I'd been watching for and the watching had been the vigil and the vigil was over because the vigil's purpose was detection and the detection was here and the here was him, grinning, bloody, victorious, rubbing his chest.

Just tired.

"Come on," I said. "Let me look at your shoulder."
