# Chapter 61

Night.

No fire. The absence of fire that was not darkness but statement — the absence that said: no one sits opposite. No one waits for the warmth. No one complains about the smoke or the positioning or the fact that the kindling was wet again.

In Book 1 I had always made fire. Every night. The routine that was the anchor and the anchor was the method and the method was: survive the night by filling the night with tasks. Fire: task one. Tea: task two. Qi-practice: task three. The sequential occupation of hours that converted darkness from threat to schedule.

Wei had expected fire. Had assumed it. Had sat down at the place where fire would be and waited for fire to appear because fire appearing was the constant and the constant was me and me was the fire-maker and the fire-maker was: reliable.

No one expected fire now.

The forest: dark. The sky: dark. The clearing where I sat: dark. The brown circle under me: invisible in darkness, the death-radius continuing unseen.

I sat. In the dark. Without fire.

And then — from somewhere deep, somewhere below conscious access, somewhere in the layer of consciousness that was not thought but imprint — something.

Not a memory. Not the archive opening. Not the pattern that had stopped.

An imprint. A shape. Not recalled but felt — the impression that a person left in the architecture of another person. Their leaving was not departure but permanent alteration.

He would have hated this.

Not the grief. Not the darkness. Not the sitting. The giving up. The posture of a woman sitting in a dead clearing without fire, without food, without the basic operations of survival that survival required. He would have hated it.

"What do you mean, you give up? Are you STUPID?"

Not a voice. Not a hallucination. Not the ghost-hearing that grief produced in people who wanted to hear. An imprint — the shape of his character pressed into my consciousness by years of proximity, by the daily experience of his stubbornness, his refusal, his constitutive inability to accept defeat or cessation or the concept that things ended and ending was acceptable.

He was stubborn. That was his core quality — not qi, not talent, not the potential that the sect had valued. Stubbornness. The, irrational, magnificent stubbornness of a person who looked at every closed door and said: that's a suggestion, not a fact.

He would have looked at me — sitting, dark, fireless — and his face would have made the expression that fourteen-year-old boys made when they saw something they considered wrong. The compressed lips. The narrowed eyes. The chin: forward, the angle of challenge.

"Get up."

The imprint. His shape. Not a voice.

And the thing that responded — the thing inside me that responded to his non-voice with something that was not a feeling but a reaction, the chemical event that occurred when a dead person's imprint collided with a living person's stasis — was:

Not hope. Hope was the word that people used when the future seemed possible and the possible was the goal. This was not that.

Refusal.

The refusal to give the universe the satisfaction of her stopping. The refusal to let the thing that had taken him also take the thing he had left — the imprint, the stubbornness, the echo of a character that had been so forceful that the echo survived the source.

He would not have wanted this.

And not-wanting was not enough. But it was something. And something was the difference between sitting in the dark and standing in the dark. And standing was the difference between this night and every night after.

I did not light a fire.

But I did not leave. The clearing. The sitting. The position that could become either: permanent or temporary. And the distinction between the two was the choice that the imprint demanded and the demand was: not permanent. Not this. Not you. Not like this.

A coal. In the dark. Not lit — but not cold. The temperature of something that had been burning and that had stopped burning but that retained the heat. Their retention was the possibility and the possibility was: not tonight. But maybe.

Not tonight.

But maybe.
