# Chapter 11

The sword stall.

Wei had found it by gravitational pull — the magnetism of metal for a boy who had been training with blades since his hands were large enough to hold one.

I stood at the herb stall across the aisle. Close enough. Three meters, line of sight — the distance of supervision that pretended to be coincidence.

He was examining a jian. Holding it wrong — deliberately, testing the balance from an unconventional grip. The vendor watched with the patience of someone who had seen many boys hold swords and whose patience was calibrated to the declining probability of sale.

"Good blade."

Not Wei. Behind him. A voice — young, warm, the temperature of friendliness that was too consistent to be spontaneous. Like a fire that had been set deliberately and whose deliberateness was invisible if you weren't looking for the match.

I looked.

A young man. Early twenties. Clean — the kind of clean that was a project, not an accident. His clothes were simple but fitted, quality understated. His smile: present. Constant. The smile of someone for whom smiling was infrastructure, not expression.

"Too heavy for your frame, though," he continued. Conversational. Light.

Wei looked at him. The assessment was fast — Wei's assessments were always fast. Nonthreatening, knowledgeable, interesting.

"I know," Wei said. "That's why I'm testing the off-balance point."

The young man's smile shifted — a millimeter. From standard to engaged.

"You test off-balance points?"

"How else do you know where the sword fails?"

A pause. The young man studied Wei. Not his face — his posture. His feet. His hips. Reading a body the way a physician reads symptoms: systematically, with conclusions forming behind an expression that remained pleasant.

"I'm Shen Liang."

"Wei."

"Just Wei?"

"Just Wei."

Shen Liang picked up a blade from the display. Short, light — a dao. He demonstrated a grip — casual, but the casualness was performance. His technique was excellent. Foundation-level cultivation expressed through muscle memory, the economy of motion from years of repetition under competent instruction.

"Iron Lotus," he said. "We're up the valley. You've heard of us?"

"Lao Chen mentions you sometimes."

"The old swordsmith? Good blades. Better conversation." A grin. Not the smile — a grin. The distinction: the grin was warmer. Also calculated, but the calculation was better hidden.

"Are you a recruiter?" Wei asked. Direct. The directness I had tried to train out of him and that had resisted training.

Shen Liang laughed. The laugh of someone caught doing what they were doing, finding the catching an opportunity rather than a problem.

"I'm a senior disciple. I notice talent. It's a hobby."

"That's recruitment."

"It's appreciation."

They talked. I listened from the herb stall, examining dried chrysanthemum with zero percent of my attention and one hundred percent of my perception trained on the conversation twelve feet away.

Shen Liang was good. Not good the way skill was good — good the way mirrors were good. He reflected Wei back at himself, amplified. When Wei talked about training, Shen Liang asked the right questions — the ones that made Wei feel heard, and the hearing was the technique, and the technique was seduction in its most abstract form: the seduction of relevance.

"You train alone?" Shen Liang asked.

"Mostly."

"Who taught you?"

A pause. The pause that preceded a choice — what to share and with whom.

"An acquaintance."

The word landed. An acquaintance. The deliberately imprecise descriptor that said: someone, not no one, but definitely not the word I would use for what she is because what she is doesn't have a word.

Shen Liang accepted it. Easy. No follow-up. He recognized a boundary, and the recognition was tactical — boundaries resisted pressure but yielded to patience, and patience was what he had.

"Your acquaintance taught you well."

"She's adequate."

I examined the chrysanthemum more closely. Adequate. The word he'd chosen — simultaneously a compliment, because adequate from Wei was high praise, and a diminishment, because adequate was the descriptor you used for things you'd outgrown and Shen Liang was listening for exactly that subtext.

They talked for thirty more minutes. Shen Liang being interested and interesting and Wei being fourteen and talking to someone who was not me.

I bought chrysanthemum. I didn't need chrysanthemum. I didn't drink chrysanthemum tea. I bought chrysanthemum because purchasing was the cover and the cover was necessary.

Fine.
