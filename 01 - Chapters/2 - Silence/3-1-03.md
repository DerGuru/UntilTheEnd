# Chapter 3

He talked for an hour.

An hour. Continuous. The verbal output of someone who had compressed a day's experience into a reservoir and was now releasing it with the pressure and enthusiasm of a system designed for sharing and whose design was being fulfilled and whose fulfillment was — loud.

The mine first. "Abandoned, totally, nobody there for years probably, but the walls — Yun, the walls have CRYSTALS. Not qi-crystals, just normal ones, but they catch the light and the whole tunnel looks like — like the inside of something alive."

He gestured. The gesture involved both arms, a rotation that was either descriptive or gravitational, and the spatial claim of approximately three square meters of our kitchen.

The waterfall next. "Three tiers. The water comes off the top and hits the second pool and the sound is — you know when qi flows through a channel that's slightly too narrow? That sound. But water. And loud."

His qi had "sung" there, he said. Not metaphorically — actually. His core had resonated with the water's kinetci energy, producing a harmonic that he'd felt in his teeth and his chest and his sinuses and that had made him laugh in a way that had nothing to do with humor and everything to do with the physical experience of resonance with a natural system.

The shrine last. "Old. Really old. The characters on the lintel — I couldn't read them. Worn down. But inside there was a feeling. Like — like an old man sleeping. Not threatening. Just. Present."

He paused. The first pause in an hour. The pause of someone who had encountered something that exceeded their vocabulary and who was searching for the words and finding the searching more honest than the finding.

"I left something there," he said. "A stone. From the garden."

"Which stone?"

"The grey one. The one I brought last week."

He'd taken a stone from our garden to leave at a weathered shrine in the forest, as an offering, as a gesture, as the act of a fourteen-year-old boy who understood that some places deserved acknowledgment and that acknowledgment required giving and that giving was the exchange and the exchange was the relationship and the relationship was with the world.

"I brought another one back," he said. "For the garden."

He produced it. Smooth, grey-blue, the size of his palm. River stone, water-worn, the kind of stone that had been shaped by patience rather than force and whose shape was therefore a record of time and duration and the accumulated effect of small things happening consistently.

"Granite," I said.

"And?"

"Nothing. Good stone."

He placed it next to the blade fragment. Between the dock grass and the lemongrass. Our garden was accumulating artifacts — the particular collection of objects that happened when a person decided that a space was important and that important spaces deserved decoration and that decoration was indistinguishable from meaning and meaning was what turned a patch of dirt with wrong plants into a place.

"Can we get a proper pot?" he asked. "For the third one. The clay's cracking."

"Tomorrow."

"You always say tomorrow."

"Tomorrow I'll say today."

He almost laughed. The corner of his mouth moved the distance of appreciation without completing the journey to sound. Then:

"It was good," he said. Quiet. The volume of summary — the final assessment delivered at the end of a report, the conclusion that compressed the data into a single adjective. "Being out there. Alone."

"I know."

"Not alone-alone. Just — alone without someone watching."

"I know."

He looked at me. The look had something in it that I recognized from a distance, from across the gap between what he was and what I was — gratitude, maybe. Or its quieter cousin: acknowledgment that the watching, however constant, had never been a cage, and the not-watching today had been permission, and the permission had been a gift.

"Good stone," he said again. Patting it. Then he went to bed. The door stuck. He hit it. It opened. He went through. It stuck behind him.

I sat in the yard. Night. Stars. The garden. Three pots, a blade fragment, two stones.

The settlement settled. Lights went out. Dogs performed their evening constituency of barking at things that probably weren't there and whose absence didn't diminish the barking's commitment.

Six weeks. We'd been here six weeks and we had a garden with the wrong plants and the right stones and a door that stuck and a boy who went out alone and came back and the coming back was the part that mattered and the mattering was the part that scared me.

I drank tea. It was cold again.

I drank it anyway.
