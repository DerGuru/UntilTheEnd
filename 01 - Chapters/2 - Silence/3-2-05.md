# Chapter 14

Morning.

I stood at the window. Wei trained outside — the forms, the transitions, the vocabulary of motion that I had demonstrated and he had absorbed and that was now his, fully his, in the way that learned things became owned things when the learning was complete enough for the learner to forget the teacher and the forgetting was the marker and the marker was here.

The hip correction. There. Third to fourth position. Invisible to anyone who wasn't looking for it and visible to anyone who was.

Shen Liang had been looking for it.

I watched Wei move through the sequence. Clean. Efficient. The body of someone who had been trained by someone who knew what training meant and whose knowing was millennia deep and whose depth was irrelevant because depth didn't matter if the surface was what was seen and the surface was: an acquaintance who was adequate.

The dilemma.

I could warn him.

I could cross the room, open the door, sit on the step, and say: The Iron Lotus is a proxy sect. Their hierarchy is competent but predatory. Their masters teach well because teaching well produces better resources and resources are their product and their product is you, is bodies with qi who can fight and die in the service of agendas that you will never see because seeing them requires the elevation that they will never give you because giving it to you would make you a person and persons are inconvenient and inconvenient is not the adjective they prefer for their investments.

I could tell him about recruitment. About the mechanics of promise and withholding that sects employed — the initial generosity, the access, the belonging that was conditional on performance and whose conditionality was invisible until it wasn't and whose visibility was the moment you tried to leave and discovered that leaving was a category that didn't exist in their vocabulary.

I could tell him what happened to young talents. The ones who entered sects at fourteen with extraordinary qi and instinctive hip corrections and brown eyes and the brightness of someone who was good and whose goodness was the lure and whose lure was the function and whose function was: be used.

I could tell him all of it. I had the information. I had the experience — not secondhand, not theoretical, the firsthand knowledge of someone who had watched sects consume talent for longer than most sects had existed. I knew the pattern. I knew the trajectory. I knew the choreography of recruitment-to-resource and the choreography was predictable and the predictability was the evidence and the evidence was: this has happened before, it will happen again, and the again is him.

But.

Telling him was directing him. Directing was controlling. Controlling was the thing I'd dismantled — deliberately, methodically, across two books of learning to let go and letting go being the thesis and the thesis being: if he's not free to choose, then every choice I make for him is a prison with better lighting.

The Zögern-Beat. The hesitation that was not indecision but philosophy made physical — the gap between what I could do and what I should do and the gap being the principle and the principle being: he has to learn. If I solve everything, he learns nothing. And if he learns nothing, he dies the first time I'm not there.

The first time I'm not there.

That sentence. The one I'd thought in the kitchen weeks ago, the one that had lodged in the space between ribs where thoughts went to calcify. The sentence that was simultaneously the reason for everything I was doing and the prediction of everything I was afraid of and the fear was the engine and the engine was the principle and the principle was: don't solve it for him.

But also: don't let him walk into it.

The contradiction. The, irreconcilable, architectural contradiction of caring for someone who was becoming autonomous and whose autonomy was the goal and whose goal was his ability to function without you and whose functioning-without-you was the absence and the absence was the fear and the fear was the thing the principle was built to address and the principle was the thing the fear kept undermining.

I could warn him. I should warn him. A good teacher — a good person — would walk out there and say: Shen Liang is not your friend. His smile is infrastructure. His seeing-you is technique. The hip correction was a hook and the hook was set and the fish is you.

But a good teacher also knows: fish that are warned about hooks don't learn to identify hooks. They learn to distrust warnings. And distrust is the corrosion that eats the bond that holds the warning in place.

Wei finished his forms. Came inside. Sweaty, breathing hard, the exertion flush that said: I used my body and my body performed and the performance is the victory and the victory is mine.

He looked at me. In the window. The looking that said: you were watching.

"How was it?" he asked.

A choice. Right now. In the kitchen. In the morning light. With the tea — cold — in my hand.

"Your seventh-form exit drifts left. Half an inch."

He nodded. Processing. Half an inch. The kind of feedback that was useful and exact and that maintained the structure — teacher, student, the exchange of technical information that was the language we spoke when the other languages were too large and too dangerous.

He went outside. Repeated the seventh-form. Corrected the drift.

I watched. From the window. With my tea. With my warning — unsaid, undelivered, holding it in the same hand as the cup and the cup was cold and the warning was warm and the warmth was the urgency and the urgency was the thing I was choosing not to act on because not-acting was the principle and the principle was the philosophy and the philosophy was the gamble and the gamble was him.

The gamble was always him.
