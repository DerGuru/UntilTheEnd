# Chapter 9

Morning.

The kind of morning that existed to make a point. Sun through the window at the angle that said: today is available, today has arrived, and the offer is sincere.

Birds. Three species. I identified them by call because identification was reflex and reflex was function and function was the thing I did instead of sleeping, which I had not done, which was not unusual.

Wei woke.

The process: a stretch — full-body, total commitment, the extension of every limb to its maximum reach as though sleep were a container he was climbing out of hand over foot. Then a yawn. Then eyes open: brown, alert, bright the way fourteen was bright when healthy and rested and facing a morning like this one.

He sat up. Pushed hair from his face. Noticed me in the doorway.

"How long have you been up?"

"A while."

"You should sleep." He said it as observation, not concern. Then: "Tea?"

"Already made."

He grinned. The grin that said I had already done the thing he was offering and redundancy was funny because it proved we were synchronized.

He dressed. Fast. The speed of purpose — putting on clothes not as preparation but as the first act of a day that had already started.

"I'm going to Lao Chen's."

Stated. Not asked. The grammar of someone whose asking phase was over.

"Tell him the second-form transition still drifts."

"I know. I felt it yesterday." He was already moving. Already at the door. Already halfway into the day while I was still standing in the doorway holding tea. "I'll fix it."

*I'll fix it.* Not: will you show me. Not: can you help. The pronoun shift. The grammatical evidence of autonomy.

He stepped outside. Barefoot — the choice that was preference, not laziness. Wei wanted to feel the thing he walked on because walking was the act and the act deserved sensation.

The sun hit his hair. Brown. With the gold that sun produced on dark hair when the angle was correct.

He ran.

Not jogging. Running. The run of someone for whom the distance between here and there was an invitation, and invitations were accepted at full speed because speed was joy and joy was available.

Fast. Fourteen and fast.

He turned the corner. Past Frau Huang's house, past the garden wall, past the point where the path bent toward Lao Chen's workshop.

He didn't look back.

Not once. Because he wasn't uncertain. Because looking back was for people who doubted what they were leaving behind, and he didn't doubt me. I was the constant. The wall at his back, the tea in the pot, the correction he no longer needed but that was available. Always available.

He didn't look back because he was sure.

I stood in the doorway. Tea in my hand. The cold version. The version that was consistent and mine in the way that cold tea was always mine because warm tea required timing and timing required presence and presence was the thing I was spending on him.

The dust his feet had lifted, settling. The air after someone has moved through it quickly — warmer, displaced, still vibrating.

The garden. Three pots. The dock grass, vertical and wrong and committed. The nettle-cousin, producing its ambiguous stalk. The lemongrass, being correct by accident. The blade fragment catching morning light. The two stones.

Morning. This morning. The kind that existed to make a point.

*It's going to be fine. Maybe. This time.*

He turned the corner and was gone.

He didn't look back.
