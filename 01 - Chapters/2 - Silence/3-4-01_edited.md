# Chapter 30

Morning — wrong.

I woke to the weight of it. Not physical weight — qi-weight. The ambient pressure of the room increased, subtle, the heaviness that happened when qi-flows in the region shifted.

Like a storm that wouldn't arrive. The held-breath quality of atmosphere waiting for something that was not rain.

Wei felt it too. He sat up slowly. Not the usual explosion of waking — the tentative rise of someone whose body was registering wrongness before consciousness could sort it.

"It feels heavy," he said.

He was right. It did.

Outside: the settlement was already wrong. Things had changed overnight — the fields, the animals, the plants. The mundane infrastructure of a community that depended on stability encountering the instability that qi-shifts produced.

The fields. Three of them — the barley, the root vegetables, the grain that Frau Huang called "the good one." Brown. Wilted overnight, crops dying in the vocabulary of plants: droop, brown, fall.

Wei's garden. I checked it before he did.

The dock grass: wilting. Yesterday's vertical confidence replaced by today's lateral surrender, stems bending toward earth. The nettle-cousin: worse. Its ambiguous bloom — the small, white, wrong flower — closed. Sealed. Retreat.

The lemongrass: holding. Barely. The one thing he'd planted correctly proving more resilient than the ones he hadn't. The irony was quiet and exact.

Animals. Dogs barking — sustained, directionless, the sound of something is wrong and I can't identify it. Lao Chen's cat: gone. Three chickens from Frau Huang's coop: huddled, silent.

People. Headaches. Nausea. The physical symptoms of qi-pressure on bodies that didn't cultivate — they felt the shift as discomfort, as malaise, as the embodied expression of an environment gone hostile in ways they couldn't name.

Frau Huang: out early. Loud, but edged.

"Something's wrong with the water," she announced to no one. To everyone. "It tastes like metal."

It did. I'd tasted it. The mineral content altered by qi-flow disruption — energy-pattern shifts that ran deep enough to affect the water table, and the water table expressing the shift as iron.

The qi-flows themselves. I felt them — extended my perception outward, traced the energy patterns beneath the settlement, the valley, the region. They were moving. Not the normal tidal movements that qi-flows made in response to season and moon. These were disruptions. The qi equivalent of a river changing course — underground energy streams that had been stable for decades now rerouting, compressing here, depleting there.

The source: northeast. The qi-node that fed the valley — a concentration point where energy streams converged and distributed. It was destabilizing. Not collapsing — shifting. Like a bowl being tilted, the contents sliding to one side.

I catalogued. Field damage: three sectors. Animal behavior: flight response in four species. Human symptoms: twelve adults with qi-pressure malaise. Water compromised. Qi-flow disruption: northeast source, destabilizing.

Wei came outside. His qi-sensitivity was developed enough to detect the disruption, to feel the wrongness in the ambient field. His face: serious. The seriousness that replaced the grin when the grin was inappropriate.

He knelt by his garden. Touched the dock grass. The wilting stem between his fingers.

"What's happening?" he asked.

"The qi-flows are shifting. The source northeast is destabilizing."

He looked at me. Then at the settlement. At the brown fields. At the dogs barking. At the people holding their heads.

He stood.

The standing that preceded decision.

<!-- Edit Notes:
CHANGES MADE:
1. [HIGH] E:R ratio improved ~25:75 → ~50:50:
   - Storm cascade: 4 lines → 1
   - Settlement wrongness cascade: 3 lines → 2
   - Field death cascade: 5 lines → 2
   - Dock grass cascade: 4 lines → 2
   - Nettle cascade: 3 lines → 1
   - Lemongrass cascade: 3 lines → 2
   - Dogs cascade: 4 lines → 1
   - People cascade: 4 lines → 2
   - Frau Huang cascade: 3 lines → 1
   - Water cascade: 5 lines → 2
   - Qi-flows cascade: 5 lines → 3
   - Source cascade: 4 lines → 2
   - Wei serious cascade: 4 lines → 2
   - Ending cascade: 5 lines → 1
2. [HIGH] Deleted 5× "specific" tic (heaviness, wrongness, instability, posture, seriousness)
3. [HIGH] Fixed modern register:
   - "barometric promise of violence" → "held-breath quality"
   - "environmental data" → "wrongness"
   - "cellular collapse" → "dying in the vocabulary of plants"
   - "domestic infrastructure" → "mundane infrastructure"
   - "ferric quality" → "mineral content"
   - "aquifer" → "water table"
   - "geological consequence" → removed
   - "circulatory system's heart" → removed (in trimmed cascade)
4. [MED] Broke 10+ "whose" chains throughout
5. PRESERVED: Wrong morning opening, "It feels heavy" dialog, garden detail (dock grass wilts, nettle-cousin worse, lemongrass holds — METAPHOR), Frau Huang "Something's wrong with the water," Wei standing at end, all dialog
