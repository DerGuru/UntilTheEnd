# Chapter 6

He executed the technique perfectly.

No correction needed. No adjustment. No intervention from me, no verbal nudge, no the-elbow-is-three-degrees-too-high, no the-weight-should-shift-a-half-beat-earlier. He performed the seventh-form integrative sequence — the most complex pattern I'd taught him, the one that required simultaneous qi-circulation through three meridian sets while maintaining physical precision through twelve transitional postures — and he performed it without error.

Not just without error. With grace. With the quality of movement that transcended technique and became expression, that turned a series of learned positions into a language and the language was his and the language was fluent and the fluency was the thing I was watching from the fence post where I sat and where my tea was cold and where the afternoon was golden and where the boy in the yard was doing something that I had seen approximately eleven thousand times across four thousand years and that still, after all of it, produced in me the particular combination of pride and vertigo that accompanied watching someone finish becoming what you'd helped them become.

He was ready.

The thought arrived not as conclusion but as recognition — the identification of a state that had been approaching and that had arrived and whose arrival was not dramatic but administrative, the moment when a student's trajectory intersected the threshold of independence and the intersection was a coordinate you could plot and I had plotted it and the coordinate was here, this afternoon, this yard, this sequence performed without error.

A few months more. Maybe a year. And he would have nothing left to learn from me that he couldn't learn faster from experience, and experience was the better teacher because experience didn't have my limitations, my projections, my inability to be what he needed instead of what I was.

The trigger was mechanical. An association. Not a decision to remember but a collision between present perception and stored data, the way a smell triggers a room you haven't entered in decades or a sound triggers a voice you haven't heard in centuries.

He was ready. The way someone else had been ready. Once.

A man. I don't remember his face — not accurately, not with the precision that I remembered everything else. The face had been averaged by time, merged with the faces of others, became representative rather than exact. But his hands: those I remembered. Large. Calloused in the particular pattern of someone who had held a sword and a brush and a child with equal frequency and who had developed the musculature to serve all three.

He was the last of a long line. Not the best-born — the best-made. Talent was adequate. Diligence was his instrument. He played it with the persistence of water on stone, with the patience of someone who had decided that becoming great was a logistics problem and that logistics responded to organization and that organization was the domain of people who were willing to do the same thing every day without the reassurance that the thing was working.

He was. Working.

It took — years. Many of them. Through the stage where he struggled and the stage where he improved and the stage where he plateaued and the stage where the plateau became a launching surface and the launching was the breakthrough and the breakthrough was the competence that I couldn't teach because it wasn't teachable, it was achievable, and the achievement was his.

"I don't need you anymore."

He said it with a smile. Not ungrateful — honest. The honesty of someone who had reached the top of the thing they were climbing and who could see, from the top, that the person who had helped them climb was no longer necessary at this altitude and that the acknowledgment was not rejection but recognition and the recognition was accurate and the accuracy was a kindness because kindness was honesty delivered with awareness of its weight.

I was relieved.

That was the truth. Relief. The, bone-deep relief of someone who had been carrying a responsibility and who was now allowed to set it down and whose setting-down was permission granted by the responsibility itself. He was ready. He didn't need me. I could go.

I went.

Three months.

Three months and the kingdom he'd built — not inherited, BUILT, through the application of everything I'd taught him and everything he'd taught himself and the intersection of both — was ash. Not from war. Not from enemies. From overreach. From the precise application of techniques designed for a system that was larger than one man to a system that was one man's ambition, and the ambition exceeded the system's capacity and the capacity's failure was the death of the kingdom and the people in it and the man himself.

He'd used what I taught him. Correctly. With precision. With the competence that I'd cultivated over years. And the competence had killed him because competence without limitation was demolition and I had taught him the competence and I had not taught him the limitation because teaching limitation required admitting that I had limitations and I did not, at the time, admit that, because admitting it would have required being a person and I was not a person and the not-being was my armor and the armor was what let me walk away and the walking-away was what killed him.

"He got everything he needed," I said. Out loud. To no one. To the air and the fence and the cold tea. "Everything, except—"

I didn't finish. Still. After millennia. The sentence had a end that I knew and that I wouldn't speak because speaking it would make it a rule and the rule would be applicable to the present and the present contained a fourteen-year-old boy performing a seventh-form sequence without error in a yard in a settlement where we had a house and a garden and a door that stuck.

Wei stopped. Wiped sweat. Grinned.

"Was that good?"

"Acceptable."

He was different. He WAS different. He was stubborn where the other had been precise. He was defiant where the other had been methodical. He adapted where the other had optimized. He survived through stubbornness and the universe's apparent inability to kill things that refused to acknowledge the attempt, and the refusal was his gift and his armor and it was better armor than mine because his was genuine and mine was a pose.

He was different.

He had to be different.

Because if he wasn't—

I drank my tea. Cold. The garden was golden in the late light. The dock grass was thriving. The lemongrass was lemongrass. The blade fragment caught the sun and threw a line of reflected light across the yard, a small bright stripe on the packed earth, temporary, beautiful, meaningless except for the meaning that I was assigning it and that the meaning was "stay" and "stay" was the most dangerous word I knew.

Wei trained on. I watched.

Different.

Please.
