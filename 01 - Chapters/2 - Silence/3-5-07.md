# Chapter 43

The last evening.

There was no way to know it was the last evening. That's a lie. I knew. The signatures, the positioning, the escalation pattern that I had seen before — in other lives, other wars, other carefully labeled operations that targeted and extracted and eliminated. The pattern was the knowledge and the knowledge was the certainty and the certainty was: tomorrow.

Wei sat on the veranda. Barefoot. Legs over the edge, hanging, the way he'd sit when he was nine and the world was large and the sitting was exploration of the height of the veranda and the feeling of air under feet that hadn't reached the ground yet.

He was doing nothing.

Not training. Not sword-sharpening. Not bragging. Not telling a story. Not asking a question. Not being Wei in any of the ways that Wei was Wei.

Just sitting.

The sun — low, yellow-orange, the quality of light that happened at the end of summer days when the day was releasing its heat and the heat was becoming warmth and the warmth was becoming memory. It hit the mountains and the mountains turned gold and the gold turned red and the red turned dark.

I sat beside him. Not close. The gap: deliberate, precise, the distance that two people maintained when both people knew and neither wanted to know and the knowing was the weight and the weight required structural spacing.

Quiet.

A crow lifted from the tree line. Black against gold. It circled once — the slow arc of a bird that had been disturbed — and settled again. Whatever had startled it was invisible from here.

The settlement behind us — its barriers pulsing faintly, the protection signs humming at a frequency below human hearing, the escape routes marked and waiting. Everything ready. Everything prepared. Everything except.

He breathed.

And then the light.

Not a flicker this time. Not the intermittent core-glow that came and went and came and went. Their coming-and-going was the pattern I had catalogued and tracked and measured in twitches per minute. This was something else.

A breach.

At his breastbone. Through his shirt. Visible — not suggested, not implied, not the faint luminescence that required proximity and darkness. Visible in daylight. In the golden light of the setting sun, his core produced its own light and the light was brighter.

In rest. Not combat, not training, not stress, not exertion. Sitting. Barefoot. Legs over the edge. Just sitting.

The light came through the fabric the way sunlight came through paper — diffused but present, the geometry of the source visible in the illumination of the surface. Round. At the sternum. Steady for two seconds, then stronger, then steady at the stronger level.

Qi-Clock Stage 3. The stage that confirmed what the stages existed to confirm: the process was no longer conditional. Was no longer dependent on activity or stress or combat or core-usage. Was now autonomous, self-sustaining, the degradation that no longer needed a trigger because the degradation had become the baseline and the baseline was the countdown.

He looked down.

The light — visible even to him, even without the perception I possessed, even without the millennia of diagnostic experience. A boy could see his own chest glowing through his own shirt. That required no expertise.

He looked up. At the mountains. At the red-going-dark.

He didn't say "just tired."

He didn't say anything for a long time.

The silence between us — thick, heavy, exact. Not comfortable. Not uncomfortable. The silence of two people who lived in the same house and who shared the same truth. Their sharing was the silence and the silence was the closest thing to honesty either of us had managed in weeks.

The sun moved. Lower. The red deepened.

"I'm not going to stop," he said.

Not to me. Not really. To the mountains, maybe. To the light at his sternum. The problem was not something he could solve by stopping. Stopping was not who he was.

I didn't answer.

"I know what you'll say." He picked at the wood of the veranda. The gesture of adolescent deflection — looking down, occupied with something small, avoiding the larger conversation by engaging with the smaller texture. "That I should rest. That I should be careful. That the core—"

"I wasn't going to say that."

He looked at me.

And the light at his sternum — still there, steady, the glow of a core consuming faster than it regenerated.

"What were you going to say?"

The truth? That I had seen this before. That the light was the stage that preceded the final stage. That the final stage was the stage that had no stage after it. That the time between this light and that end was measured in days, not weeks. Not months. Days.

That I could slow it. That the technique existed. That my hands on his sternum, my qi in his pathways, the intervention that I had performed on others — in other eras, in other bodies — would buy him time. Would stabilize the cascade. Would extend the countdown from days to weeks, maybe months.

That I was choosing not to.

That the choice was the zögern and the zögern was the principle and the principle was the cage and the cage was the thing I lived in and the thing he was dying outside of.

"That I know," I said.

A pause.

"This time I fight," he said.

The same words. From the forge. From the veranda.

"I know," I said.

Below, in the settlement, someone dropped a pot. The clang carried — metal on stone, domestic, absurd. A voice followed, scolding. The ordinary sounds of people living their last normal evening without knowing it was their last.

The sun set. The mountains went dark. The light at his sternum remained — faint, steady, burning with its own fuel. Their fuel was finite.

Stars came.

An owl. Somewhere in the forest to the west. The call repeated three times and stopped. In the distance, a fox barked — sharp, brief, territorial. The forest had its own business tonight.

The settlement: dark, quiet, barriers humming, protection signs alive.

Tomorrow.

Neither of us moved. Neither of us went inside. Neither of us made the decision that normal people make at the end of normal evenings — to stand, to enter, to separate into rooms, to sleep.

We stayed.

The veranda. The dark. The stars. The light that came through his shirt like a second heartbeat, visible, persistent, the evidence of the thing that was happening.

Tomorrow was battle.

And battle was the thing he wanted. And wanting it was the thing that made him Wei. And being Wei was the thing that was killing him.

And the killing was the thing I could have stopped.

And the stopping was the thing I chose not to do.

And the choosing was the thing I would carry.

I didn't know yet how heavy it would be. But I suspected. And suspecting was the closest thing to knowing. And knowing — the full knowing, the weight of it, the gravity of a choice that results in a death — that would come tomorrow.

The stars moved. The night deepened. The light at his chest continued.

Somewhere in the darkness: eight signatures. A commander. A plan.

Somewhere closer: a sharpened sword leaning against a bed.

And between all of it — between the signatures and the sword, between the plan and the boy, between the barrier-protected walls and the unprotected core — me. Sitting. Watching. The gap between us: the precise distance of someone who would not close it.

Morning would come.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: E:R ratio improved from ~28:72 — added 3 external events: crow at tree line, dropped pot in settlement, owl/fox in forest. Shifts ratio toward ~40:60.
- Fixed [HIGH]: "specific" tic — verified clean (0 instances).
- Applied Global Patterns: GP-03 (trimmed 3 post-show cascades: "Their production was the problem" chain, "Their condition was the permanent state" chain, "repetition that was not repetition but confirmation" chain).
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The dropped pot — domestic sound against the weight of the last evening — gives the scene grounding and irony without breaking tone.
