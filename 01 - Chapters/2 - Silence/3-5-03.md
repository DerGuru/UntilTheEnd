# Chapter 39

Heiler Mao found me at the well.

Morning. Early. The early that existed before Wei woke and after the settlement began and that I occupied because occupying it was the routine and the routine was: exist in the spaces between his sleeping and his waking, use the spaces for the things that couldn't happen while he was present.

Mao walked slowly. Slower than usual — the deceleration of someone whose body was carrying more than its usual load and the load was not physical. His chin-tap: absent. His hand hung at his side, the inertia of a gesture that had been habitual and was now exhausted.

He stood beside me. Didn't speak. The silence of someone assembling a sentence that they didn't want to assemble and whose assembly was the obligation and the obligation was medical.

"The boy—"

He stopped. Started. The stuttering ignition of someone whose engine was reluctant.

"I can't say what it is. My experience isn't enough. But—"

He looked at me. His eyes: the eyes of someone who had arrived at a conclusion that was beyond his vocabulary and whose beyond-vocabulary was the gap and the gap was the thing he was bridging with: but.

"It's getting faster."

Three words. The three words that were his diagnosis, his prognosis, his entirety. He had felt Wei's core — with his rudimentary hands, with his rudimentary sensitivity, with the palms that were designed for fevers and broken bones. And his rudimentary sensitivity had detected what my sophisticated sensitivity had been measuring: the acceleration. The trend. The slope.

He waited. For me to say something. The waiting of a doctor who had delivered news and was expecting the recipient to respond and whose expected response was: information, context, the things that someone who knew more would provide to someone who knew less.

I said nothing.

He nodded. The nod that was the acceptance — of my silence, of my withholding, of the dynamic between us that said: I know things and you know I know things and the knowing is mine and the mine is the wall.

"You know what it is, don't you."

Not a question. A statement. The flat certainty of someone who had worked around enough sick people to recognize the expression of someone who recognized the sickness and whose recognition was the expertise and the expertise was the silence.

I said nothing.

He nodded again. Turned. Walked away. His hand: still at his side. The chin-tap: still absent. The exhaustion of a healer who had identified a problem he couldn't solve and whose not-solving was the limitation and the limitation was the walk and the walk was slow.

Evening.

Wei sat at the table. Looked at me. The direct look — the version that preceded the direct words, the version that said: I am about to say something that requires eye contact and eye contact is the prerequisite.

"Something's wrong."

I put down my tea. The putting-down that I had performed when he told me about the sect and that I was performing again because the putting-down was the gesture and the gesture was: I am giving you my attention.

"Be honest."

Two words. The two words that were the demand and the demand being fair and fair being the thing I owed him and the owing being the debt and the debt being: I had information and he did not and the asymmetry was mine to correct or maintain and correcting was the honest thing and maintaining was the thing I had been doing.

Silence. Long. The duration that a silence achieved when the person who was supposed to speak was calculating what to say and the calculating was the selection and the selection was: which truth, how much, how shaped.

"Your qi grew too fast. Your core is unstable."

True. Partially. The partial truth that was the craftsmanship of someone who had learned — across millennia — that partial truths were more effective than lies because partial truths contained enough verifiable content to be credible and enough omission to be protective.

Wei absorbed it. No shock — the absence of shock that said: I suspected this, I have been feeling the symptoms, I have been calling them 'tired' and 'tired' was the word I used instead of the word I feared.

"Since when?"

"A while."

"Why didn't you—"

He stopped. The sentence that he didn't finish. Why didn't you tell me. The question that hung in the air the way the other sentences had hung — the 'not just you' from the kitchen, the 'what IS that' from the well — sentences that existed as shapes in the space between us, visible, heavy, occupying volume.

He didn't finish because the answer was too large. The answer was: because telling you was directing you and directing was controlling and controlling was the thing I had vowed not to do. Or: because I was afraid. Or: because the information wouldn't have helped and helpful information was the only kind I was willing to provide and this wasn't helpful because this was hopeless and hopeless was not a word in my vocabulary because my vocabulary refused it.

All of these answers. None spoken.

What I also didn't say:

I didn't say: it's my fault. I didn't say: my qi accelerated your development. I didn't say: the enabling that happened in the mountains — the proximity, the exposure, the ambient transfer that my presence produced — was the catalyst. I didn't say: I broke you before you knew what breaking meant. I didn't say: every symptom you're experiencing is the downstream consequence of my existence near yours, of the radiation that my nature produced and that your young core absorbed and that the absorption produced: this, the instability, the clock, the flickering.

The guilt-truth. The full truth. The version that would have included: me. As cause. As origin. As the reason.

I said: unstable. Too fast. These were true. Partially.

The other half — the half that was mine, the guilt-half, the causal-half — I held. Not from courage. Not from strategy. From — what? Protection. But whose protection? His, from the knowledge that his teacher was his damage? Or mine, from the acknowledgment that my teaching was his breaking?

I didn't know. The not-knowing was the honest answer and the honest answer was the only thing I was not providing.

He looked at me. Across the table. Across the tea. Across the space.

He didn't ask again.
