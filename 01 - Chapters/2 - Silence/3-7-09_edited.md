# Chapter 62

Morning.

I went back.

Not to the house. Not to the room that contained absence. To the garden. His. The three pots at the edge of the path, the blade fragment, the two grey stones. The collection he had assembled because assembling was his method: here is a garden, it has things in it, the things are mine.

Two of the pots: dead.

The dock grass. Brown. Dried. The stems collapsed inward — a plant that had lost its water source. No one watered it. For days. The days between the battle and now.

The nettle-cousin. Same. Brown, curled, the leaves fallen from stems that were stalks that were sticks that were dead.

Two wrong herbs, chosen by a child who knew nothing about herbs. The charm of knowing nothing was irrelevant now. The relevance died with the watering.

The third pot.

The lemongrass. Right by accident. The one he'd chosen without knowing what he was choosing. The herb that worked — that had root structure, that had biological investment in substrate that the other two lacked.

Alive.

Green. In the morning grey. Among the brown circle of my proximity and the brown death of the other two pots and the general browning of everything within three paces. Green. Growing. The stems upright, the leaves extended. Not dead because the plant had roots and the roots were deep and the depth was the survival.

Not my protection. Not qi. Not anything I had done or could do or would do. Biology. The simple, mechanical, non-magical fact that roots in soil + depth + time produced resilience and the resilience produced survival and the survival was here, in a clay pot pressed by dead hands.

I picked it up.

The pot. Heavier than expected — wet earth, clay, root mass. The weight of a small thing that contained a smaller thing that was alive by the mechanism of its own rootedness.

My fingertips: numb. The qi-emission had turned inward as well as outward. Feedback. Sustained, uncontrolled emission: the emitter's own extremities losing sensitivity. Numbness at the tips. The things I touched: barely felt. The pot was present in my hands by pressure, not by texture.

Earth crumbled at the rim. Dry at the edge, wet at the center. A pot watered days ago — sufficient for the roots but not for the surface. Earth fell. Onto the dirt. Small amounts. Brown on brown.

I held it.

The pot sat in my hands. The lemongrass extended upward from the soil. Green in the grey, alive in the dead.

I didn't know why I was holding it. The reason was not available. The thing that moved my hands to the pot was not a decision but a reflex — the same kind of reflex Wei had when he heard moaning. The involuntary orientation toward the thing that was alive in the space where alive was rare.

I held it. And it didn't die.

In my hands. In the three-pace radius that killed grass and dropped insects and weakened trees and nauseated people. The pot: alive. The herb: green. The roots: holding.

Not because of me. Not by my protection or my will or my ancient, useless, self-healing architecture that healed scratches and didn't heal sons. Because of roots. Because the plant had invested in depth and the depth had produced the resilience and the resilience was the thing I was holding and the thing I was holding was alive.

---

I sat.

Somewhere. At the edge. Of the settlement, of the forest, of the space between the place where people were and the place where I was. The boundary. The margin.

The pot beside me. Upright. The lemongrass: extending. Green.

Everything around me: dying. The grass: brown. The leaves: curled. The three-pace radius: operational, persistent. The grief-field that continued because grief continued because continuing was its nature.

The pot: alive.

Not because it was special. Not because it was magical. Not because Wei had blessed it or qi-enhanced it or performed any operation that elevated it beyond what it was. Because it had roots. And roots held. And holding was the difference between the two dead herbs and the one that wasn't.

*What has roots dies slower.*

Not a sentence with an origin. Not a quote, not a wisdom, not a teaching from any master in any century. A fact. Observed. The truth that required no frame because the frame was: the pot is alive and the grass is dead and the difference is roots.

What has roots dies slower.

I sat with the pot. In the margin. In the grey morning that was grey the way mornings were grey when the person who made mornings bright was not in them.

The settlement behind me. Damaged. Standing. The people in it: alive, cautious, maintaining the distance my radius required.

The forest ahead. Green. Weakened at the edges by my proximity but green beyond the edges and the beyond was the rest and the rest was the world and the world continued.

Between: me. Sitting. With a pot that did not wilt.

No sound. No wind. No voice, no argument, no complaint about the herbs, no declaration about cultivation, no stubbornness embodied in a fourteen-year-old body that moved through the world as if the world owed him an explanation and the explanation was overdue.

Silence.

The book's name.

The pot's green.

The nothing that remained. And the roots that held.

<!-- Edit Notes:
Part 7 — FINAL CHAPTER — Lemongrass / Roots / "What has roots dies slower" (E:R ~35:65):
1. [HIGH] Deleted 7× "specific": collection, configuration, biological investment, posture (plant), consequence, moisture gradient, kind of truth
2. [HIGH] Cut all "whose" chains throughout
3. [HIGH] E:R maintained ~35:65:
   - Collection cascade: "specific collection" → "The collection"
   - Dead grass cascade: simplified plant-death description
   - Charm cascade: "whose knowing-nothing was the charm" → separated
   - Accident cascade: trimmed "whose choosing was the accident"
   - Alive cascade: kept — this is the CORE IMAGE
   - Roots cascade: kept — essential
   - Weight cascade: trimmed "whose rootedness was the quality"
   - Fingertips cascade: simplified "specific consequence of sustained..." → "Sustained, uncontrolled emission"
   - Earth cascade: simplified moisture gradient → "A pot watered days ago"
   - Reflex cascade: simplified
4. [CRITICAL] PROTECTED — ALL CRITICAL BEATS UNTOUCHED:
   - Three pots: two dead, one alive (STRUCTURAL)
   - Lemongrass: right by accident (CRITICAL)
   - "Alive." standalone paragraph (CRITICAL)
   - "Green. In the morning grey. Among the brown..." (CRITICAL image)
   - "roots in soil + depth + time" (CRITICAL formula)
   - "in a clay pot pressed by dead hands" (CRITICAL)
   - "I held it. And it didn't die." (CRITICAL)
   - "healed scratches and didn't heal sons" (CRITICAL)
   - "*What has roots dies slower.*" ×2 (CRITICAL — the book's thematic statement)
   - No sound list (voice, argument, complaint, declaration, stubbornness)
   - "Silence. / The book's name. / The pot's green. / The nothing that remained. And the roots that held." (CRITICAL FINAL IMAGE — UNTOUCHED)
5. EISERNE REGEL note: Final chapter is pure perception — Yun looking at pots, holding plant, sitting at edge. No flashbacks, no memories, no explanations. The observation IS the meaning. Compliant.
