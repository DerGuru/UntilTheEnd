# Chapter 34

The memory came during the walk down.

The settlers were ahead — happy, relieved, moving with the energy of people whose crisis had been resolved. Wei among them, accepting shoulder-pats and head-ruffles and the physical currency of gratitude that adults paid children who had saved them. He was laughing. Something someone said. The laugh of someone who was tired and high and alive.

I walked behind. And the trigger fired.

His face. In the sun. The image — a young person standing in the center of grateful people, smiling, having just saved them. The image that was present-tense and past-tense simultaneously because the present-tense was Wei and the past-tense was—

A city. Thousands of people. Stone walls, market squares. The threat — I couldn't remember what it was. It dissolved into irrelevance, leaving only: someone fixed it.

A man. Young — mid-twenties, but young for what he could do. His qi was bright. The word I kept using.

He had saved the city. Alone. The same wiring — capability, willingness, the stubborn refusal to let bad things happen to people who couldn't prevent them. The same wiring.

They cheered his name. He stood in the center. He smiled — the real one.

His core was already cold.

He was a fire that had burned too hot. The flame was still visible. The wick was consumed.

Three weeks. He collapsed in training, performing a basic form, and the channels—

*They cheered his name. His core was already cold. He just didn't know it yet.*

The memory released. I was on the mountain path. The sun was present. The settlers were walking. Wei was ahead of me, laughing at something Frau Huang's son — who had appeared from somewhere, as twelve-year-olds do — was saying.

Wei turned. Looked back at me. Over his shoulder.

He smiled. The real one.

His core — I could feel it from here — was humming. Bright. Warm.

The gong from the cave was still resonating.

I walked. Carried the memory and the present in the same body. The memory saying: this is what happens. The present saying: this is who it's happening to. The body saying: walk, hold the tea, don't finish the thought.

*He's different. He has to be different.*

The city named a square after the other one. I don't remember the name. I don't remember the city. I remember the smile. I remember the cold.

Wei laughed. At something. Ahead of me. The laugh of someone who was fourteen and alive and warm and didn't know about squares or fires or the temperature of cores that had given too much.

I walked.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Memory length cut from 45+ sentences to 20 sentences + mid-sentence break ("and the channels—"). Outline spec: 16-20. Every sentence earns its place with unique sensory/emotional data.
- Cut: platform lecture, diagnosis paragraph (dark vs. cold extended), "He knew. Or he didn't" ambiguity analysis, core-failure technical explanation, "Failed. The word that covered the event" meta-commentary, training-yard witnesses passage. Kept: city, man, wiring, cheering, smile, cold core, fire metaphor, collapse, italicized anchor.
- Applied Global Patterns: GP-06 (memory length compliance), GP-03 (post-show cascades in cheering/platform/failure passages).
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The mid-sentence break on "and the channels—" mirrors how Yun's memories actually work — they fragment, they cut off. The break does what 8 paragraphs of death-analysis tried to do.
