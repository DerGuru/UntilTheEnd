# Chapter 34

The memory came during the walk down.

The settlers were ahead — happy, relieved, moving with the energy of people whose crisis had been resolved. Wei among them, accepting shoulder-pats and head-ruffles and the physical currency of gratitude that adults paid children who had saved them. He was laughing. Something someone said. The laugh of someone who was tired and high and alive.

I walked behind. And the trigger fired.

His face. In the sun. The image — a young person standing in the center of grateful people, smiling, having just saved them. The image that was present-tense and past-tense simultaneously because the present-tense was Wei and the past-tense was—

A city.

Larger than this settlement by orders of magnitude. Thousands of people. Stone walls, market squares, the infrastructure of civilization that had been under threat. The threat — I couldn't remember what it was. A beast? A sect attack? A natural disaster? The threat had dissolved into irrelevance in the acid of time, leaving only: there was danger, and someone fixed it, and the fixing was the thing and the thing was the after.

A man. A cultivator. Powerful — genuinely powerful, the kind of capability that occurred once in a generation and that generated the attention that once-in-a-generation things generated. Young. Not Wei's age — older, mid-twenties maybe, but young for what he could do. His qi was — bright. The word I kept using. The word that kept applying.

He had saved the city. Whatever the threat was, he had addressed it. Alone. With the heroism that came from combination: capability, willingness, the stubborn refusal to let bad things happen to people who couldn't prevent them. His formula. His wiring. The same wiring.

They cheered his name. Thousands of voices. The sound of collective gratitude expressed as volume and the volume filling the square — the square that would be named after him, that would bear his name in stone for decades, that would be the memorial before the memorial was necessary.

He stood in the center. On the raised platform that someone had improvised because heroes needed elevation and elevation needed a platform and the platform was the symbol and the symbol was: look at this person, this person saved us, this person is more than us and the more-than is the reason we're alive.

He smiled. Not the performer's smile — the real one. The one that said: I did this, and it mattered, and mattering is the thing.

His core was already cold.

Not dark — cold. The distinction that was the diagnosis. Dark meant dead, inactive, the cessation of function. Cold meant: running, still running, but the heat that running produced had been exhausted, the thermal capacity of the system depleted by the output that saving a city required. He was a fire that had burned too hot. The flame was still visible. The wick was consumed.

He knew. Or he didn't — I was never sure about this, never sure whether the smile was the face of a man who was ignorant of his own condition or the face of a man who knew and chose to smile anyway and the choosing being the bravery and the bravery being indistinguishable from the ignorance and the indistinguishability being the cruelty.

Three weeks.

After three weeks, he collapsed. Not in battle. Not under stress. In training. In the ordinary, routine, daily activity that cultivators performed because cultivation was practice and practice was maintenance and maintenance was the thing that kept the system operational. He was performing a basic form — second-stage, foundational, nothing strenuous — and his core failed.

Failed. The word that covered the event the way a sheet covered a body — sufficient for decency, insufficient for truth. What happened was: his core's structural integrity, compromised by the overload, weakened by the three weeks of continued operation at parameters that exceeded its tolerances, reached the point where the compensatory mechanisms could no longer compensate and the no-longer was the catastrophe.

He fell. In the training yard. Among other cultivators who were performing other forms and who stopped and turned and saw him on the ground. Their seeing was the alarm and the alarm was the sound and the sound was: someone help.

He was dead before they reached him. The core failure was total. The qi-channels collapsed sequentially — a cascade, the domino-fall of energy pathways that had been stressed beyond their design limits. Their design limits had been communicated to him in the language of symptoms. Their symptoms he had interpreted as: just tired.

The city mourned. A hero who died of his own saving. A fire that burned too hot and went out.

*They cheered his name. His core was already cold. He just didn't know it yet.*

The memory released. I was on the mountain path. The sun was present. The settlers were walking. Wei was ahead of me, laughing at something Frau Huang's son — who had appeared from somewhere, as twelve-year-olds do — was saying.

Wei turned. Looked back at me. Over his shoulder.

He smiled. The real one.

His core — I could feel it from here — was humming. Bright. Warm.

The gong from the cave was still resonating.

I walked. Carried the memory and the present in the same body. The memory saying: this is what happens. The present saying: this is who it's happening to. The body saying: walk, hold the tea, don't finish the thought.

*He's different. He has to be different.*

The city named a square after the other one. I don't remember the name. I don't remember the city. I remember the smile. I remember the cold.

Wei laughed. At something. Ahead of me. The laugh of someone who was fourteen and alive and warm and didn't know about squares or fires or the temperature of cores that had given too much.

I walked.
