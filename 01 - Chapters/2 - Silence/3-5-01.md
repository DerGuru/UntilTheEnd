# Chapter 37

Morning. Before Wei.

I stood outside. The air: different. Not the qi-heavy wrongness of the destabilization — that was repaired, that was the victory, that was the thing Wei had fixed. This was different. The quality of atmosphere that existed when trained beings occupied space with the intention of not being noticed. Their not-noticing required effort. Their effort produced a signature that was the opposite of its intention: louder, to anyone who could hear.

Three qi-signatures. At the tree line. Northeast.

Dampened. Disciplined. Professional. The compression of cultivators who had been trained to suppress their presence. Their suppression was effective against most detection and ineffective against mine because mine was not most and not-most was the category I occupied.

Formation: triangle. The spatial arrangement of three-point surveillance — each position providing coverage that overlapped with the adjacent, producing a continuous field of observation that had no gaps. Textbook. The tactical arrangement that said: these are not individuals, these are a system. These are not curious — they are professional.

Iron Lotus. The signature — not the individuals but the method, the doctrine of positioning that the Iron Lotus employed and that I had been cataloguing since Shen Liang and that was now expressing itself as: scouts. Organized. Determined.

Not recruiters. The distinction was clear in the formation — recruiters worked alone, approached openly, smiled. These maintained distance. These observed. These were gathering intelligence rather than making offers.

Hunters.

The word. The accurate word. The word that described what they were doing and what they were — not people who wanted Wei, people who wanted to acquire Wei, the distinction being the difference between desire and strategy and strategy being the thing that produced triangle formations at tree lines before dawn.

I drank my tea. Didn't look toward the tree line. I didn't need to look — my perception operated without visual input, the qi-sensing that was my oldest function requiring neither line of sight nor attention, only: existence, and existence was what I was doing, standing in a doorway with cold tea and the knowledge that there were three professionals watching this settlement and the settlement containing a boy and the boy being the purpose of the watching.

I catalogued.

Position one: northeast, forty meters from the tree line. Male, Foundation stage, mid-twenties. His suppression was competent but leaked at the lower frequencies — the bass note of his qi-signature humming beneath the dampening like a heartbeat through a wall.

Position two: east-northeast, sixty meters. Female, possibly Inner Disciple level. Better suppression — her leakage was minimal, almost professional-grade. She had been doing this longer than position one.

Position three: north, thirty-five meters. Unknown level. Unknown gender. The suppression was exquisite — almost nothing leaked. This person was either very skilled at concealment or very weak, and very weak didn't deploy in triangle formations, so: very skilled.

Three hunters. Watching. Mapping. Preparing.

For what.

The answer was behind me, sleeping. The answer was the boy whose qi-signature was a signal. Their signal had been transmitted on jade. Their jade had produced a conclusion and the conclusion was this: the triangle at the tree line.

Not today. They wouldn't act today — scouts acted when the scouting was complete and the completing required observation and observation required time and time was what they were investing. Days, probably. Maybe a week. The patience of an operation that had been authorized. Their authorization came from a hierarchy and hierarchies moved at the speed of meetings and meetings were not fast.

But soon.

I drank my tea. Watched the sunrise. Watched the garden — three pots, recovering, the dock grass nearly vertical again. Watched the settlement begin its day.

Said nothing. To no one.

The air tasted the way it always tasted. I had tea and three hunters and a sleeping boy and the distance between these things was measured in meters and the meters were insufficient.
