# Chapter 21

The sound came first.

Not a sound — an anti-sound. The forest stopping. Birds: off. Stream: suddenly audible because the things louder than the stream were gone. The silence was the signal.

I felt it before I saw it. A heavy, compressed qi-signature emerging from the undergrowth thirty meters east, moving fast — the velocity of a predator that had decided.

Rock lynx.

It came out of the undergrowth like stone made flesh — grey-brown fur over muscle denser and wider than normal, a qi-enhanced beast that had been growing in these woods for years, unguided, organic. Living in a qi-rich environment long enough for the body to absorb and compound.

Wolf-height but broader. Seventy kilos of predatory mass. Qi-lines running through its fur like veins of light — pale blue, pulsing. Teeth: too long. Canines extended past what nature intended because qi had revised the intention.

Eyes: intelligent. Not human-intelligent — the intelligence of a territorial predator that had been challenged. Wei had been here three weeks. Training, broadcasting qi into a space this animal considered owned. For three weeks, the lynx had been registering the intrusion. Evaluating.

It had decided.

Wei's eyes opened.

The shift was instant — from training-trance to combat awareness, the switch in the space between one heartbeat and the next. The body knew before the mind knew.

No weapon. He'd been training unarmed. His sword was at home, leaning against the wall beside his bed, being ornamental.

The lynx charged. Direct. No circling, no assessment. It was sure it would win. Animals that circled were uncertain. Animals that charged were confident.

Wei set his stance. Low. Qi flowing into his hands — raw channeling, because refinement was a luxury and the lynx was closing faster than thought.

His hands: glowing. Gold-white.

"I can do this!"

To himself. Not to me. The self-address of someone reaching for confidence and finding it genuine — earned through months of training and years of surviving.

I dropped from the branch.

The descent: controlled, silent. I stood at the clearing's edge. Eight meters from Wei. Close enough.

My hands: ready. My qi: suppressed but present — the coiled spring. I could cross eight meters in a fraction of a second. I could unmake this animal with a thought.

I could.

The lynx reached Wei.

2. [HIGH] Deleted 5× "specific" tic
3. [HIGH] Fixed modern register:
   - "geology made kinetic" → "stone made flesh"
   - "eleven meters per second" → "faster than thought"
   - "potential energy held beneath the threshold of release" → "the coiled spring"
   - "anatomy revised by qi" → "qi had revised the intention"
4. [MED] Broke "whose" chains throughout
5. PRESERVED: Rock lynx attack scene (excellent action), "I can do this!" beat, cliffhanger ending, Yun's readiness/intervention potential, combat qi-glow
