# Chapter 1

We found a house.

Not a good house — the category didn't apply. A house. Four walls, two rooms, a roof that committed to its function with the enthusiasm of someone performing a job they'd held too long. The door stuck. Wei fixed it three times. It stuck three times. They were in a relationship now — the door and Wei — and the relationship was adversarial and ongoing and neither party showed signs of yielding.

The settlement was small. Thirty houses, a market, a well. Mountains to the north — the same mountains we'd descended from, which felt like meeting an acquaintance in a different context and discovering they looked entirely different from the front. Forest to the east, dense, green, the green of trees that hadn't been asked to be symmetrical and were thriving in the absence of the request. The nearest sect territory was three valleys away — close enough for trade, far enough for breathing.

We'd been here — how long? A month. Maybe six weeks. Long enough for the word "here" to shift from "this place we're at" to "home," and the shift happened without announcement, the way shifts happen when people stop moving.

Wei trained. Outside. Barefoot on the packed earth of what we'd designated the yard, which was a generous term for the patch of ground between our door and the neighbor's fence. His qi flowed — clean, fast, controlled. His movements were no longer a child's. He was fourteen. His body was catching up to his cultivation in spurts, with the awkwardness of a structure being renovated while still occupied.

I stood in the doorway. Tea in my hand. Watching.

This was our morning. The arrangement was comfortable. The word felt dangerous — anything that assumed a tomorrow identical to today trusted the universe to maintain a pattern, and the universe did not maintain patterns. The universe viewed patterns the way cats viewed arrangements of objects on shelves — as invitations.

But. This morning. Tea. Doorway. Wei training. The sun on the yard. The sound of the settlement waking around us — chickens with opinions, a hammer somewhere, a woman calling for someone who wasn't answering.

The garden.

Wei had planted a garden. Three herbs in clay pots, arranged along the south-facing wall with the care of someone who believed that arrangement mattered.

Two of the three were wrong. He'd planted weeds — a variant of dock grass and something that might have been wild nettle absent the defining characteristics. He'd mistaken them for healing herbs. The identification process had involved confidence, enthusiasm, and the notable absence of reference materials.

The third plant was actually a herb. Lemongrass. By accident.

I hadn't told him. He watered all three with equal care. Mornings, evenings. The wrong plants received the same attention as the right one — the same measured pour, the same careful adjustment of the pot's position to track the sun.

That was Wei. Everything or nothing. Even the weeds got water.

After training, he disappeared. The way fourteen-year-olds disappear — into the vicinity of the nearest person who isn't their parent or guardian, seeking adult attention that wasn't teaching and wasn't watching and was simply existing alongside.

The Blade Whisperer. That was my name for him — the old swordsmith three houses down. Lao Chen. His workshop was small. Dark. Full of the smell of oil and heat, the conversation between stone and steel. He sharpened blades. Repaired tools. Talked to the swords the way other people talked to pets — with endearments, encouragement, and the occasional gentle reproof.

"Every sword has a voice," he told Wei. I heard it through the window — the old man's voice, creaked at the hinges, warm where it mattered. "Yours is too loud, boy."

He didn't have a sword. Lao Chen was speaking diagnostically, the way craftsmen diagnosed things beyond their stated domain because they understood materials, and Wei was a material, and the material had a resonance.

He showed Wei how to sharpen a blade. Not with force — with patience. The angle, the pressure, the rhythm of stone on steel that was a conversation rather than an assault. Wei listened. For once — quiet. Attentive.

I watched through the window. A normal boy with a normal man. A workshop. Metal. Patience. The ordinary transaction of knowledge from old hands to young ones, the one that worked not through instruction but through proximity.

I could never have been that. The thought arrived without self-pity — categorically. I was not the kind of being that a fourteen-year-old boy sat with and learned patience from. My patience was geological and his need was human. Lao Chen could cross that gap. Ordinary gifts were the best kind because they didn't know they were gifts.

Wei came home for lunch. Brought a piece of metal — a broken blade fragment, palm-sized, polished until the surface reflected.

"For the garden," he said.

"That's a blade fragment."

"For the garden."

He placed it among the pots. Between the dock grass and the lemongrass. A shard of steel in a garden of wrong plants.

I drank my tea. He ate his rice. The door stuck when he closed it. He hit it with his hip — practiced, automatic, a structural defect absorbed into choreography.

The sun moved. The shadows shortened. Somewhere, a child laughed. Somewhere else, a chicken lost an argument.

Normal. Absolutely, terrifyingly normal.
