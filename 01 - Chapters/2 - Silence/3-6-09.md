# Chapter 52

I stood up.

Slowly. The way someone stood when the thing they were lifting was not their body but the weight of everything their body contained. Slowly, because slowly was the only available speed. The muscles that operated were the muscles that operated — automatic, mechanical, the biomechanical fact of upright bipedal movement that occurred because the body knew how and the knowing was independent of wanting.

I stood.

The silence held. The world without sound — persistent, total, the condition that had begun when his core went dark and that continued because the condition was not external but internal, not the world being quiet but my perception refusing the world's noise.

I stood.

Under my feet: the grass. Green. The green of late-summer settlement grass that had been walked on by settlers and animals and children for years. Grass that was alive because grass was alive.

It died.

Not metaphorically. Under my left foot: brown. Spreading outward from the sole like a stain. Under my right foot: the same. Brown, dry, the cellular death of plant tissue exposed to qi-radiation that was not radiation but grief expressed as energy expressed as destruction.

The circle widened. Five paces. Ten. Fifteen. The grass dying in a radius — outward from where I stood, the geometry of a sphere of influence that I was not projecting but leaking. Uncontrolled. Unconscious. The qi that was leaving my body the way heat left a furnace: through every surface, in every direction, without intention.

Twenty paces. The flowers at the edge of the communal garden: wilting. Stems bowing. Petals falling. The small herbs that someone had planted along the path: curling inward, browning, the death-curl of plants responding to environmental hostility.

Twenty-five. Thirty.

Not the entire settlement. Not the world. A radius. Limited by limits that I possessed. Their possessing was the only thing between the dying and everything dying.

The settlers felt it.

The man by the well — one of the men who had stood at the wall with farming tools — staggered. His hand: on the well's edge. His face: pale, then green. He bent, doubled over, and the sound he made — if I could hear sound — was the sound of a body rejecting its contents. Nausea. The physical response of a human system exposed to qi-emission at a frequency that human systems rejected because rejecting was surviving.

Another. A woman by the north wall. Blood in her mouth — not from injury but from the spontaneous capillary response that qi-saturation produced in untrained bodies. She spat. Red. Looked at it. Looked at me.

The expression on her face.

Not anger. Not understanding. The expression of a person seeing something they could not categorize — a woman standing in a circle of dead grass whose standing was the cause of the dead grass. Their cause was the thing that could not be named because naming required a framework and no framework contained this.

Another man: on his knees. Not praying — failure of orientation. The inner ear, the vestibular system, the apparatus of balance that qi-emission disrupted at high frequencies. He couldn't tell up from down. His hands: on the ground. Searching.

The air: heavy. Metallic. The taste — blood and ozone and something older, something that predated this century and this era — hanging in the atmosphere like a fact.

I was not doing this. I was. Both. The distinction between intention and expression being the distinction between murder and weather and the weather was: this.

I stood.

The dead grass: spreading. The nausea: spreading. The blood-taste: spreading. Each one a symptom of the same cause and the cause was me and me was the thing standing in the middle of a dying circle in a grey morning beside a dead boy with torn hands.

The settlers who were close enough: moved away. Not running — staggering, crawling, the retreat that legs produced when legs were uncertain and uncertainty was violent. They moved away from me the way animals moved away from fire — not because fire was hostile but because fire was fire and fire's nature included burning and burning's nature included everything near it.

No one approached the body. No one approached me. The circle: isolating. The dead grass: a border. The border: mine.

I existed in the circle.

The silence. The dead grass. The spreading radius.

Shen — the boy, Frau Huang's son — was outside the circle. Fifteen paces beyond the edge. Sitting on the ground. Crying — soundless, in my perception. His mouth: open. His hands: over his ears. Whether the sound was too much for him or the silence was too much for him was a distinction I could not make and the making was beyond me.

I stood in the dead grass.

Holding nothing. Touching nothing. Looking at the body that I had not touched because touching was the thing I denied and the denial still held because denial was the only structure remaining and the structure was: I will not collapse into this. I will not become the version that collapses. I will stand. In dead grass. In silence.

Standing.
