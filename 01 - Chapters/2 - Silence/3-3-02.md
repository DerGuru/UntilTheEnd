# Chapter 21

The sound came first.

Not a sound — an anti-sound. The specific acoustic event that was the forest stopping. Birds: off. Stream: there but suddenly audible because the things that had been louder than the stream were gone and the gone was the silence and the silence was the signal.

I felt it before I saw it. The qi-disturbance — a heavy, compressed signature emerging from the undergrowth thirty meters east, moving fast, the specific velocity of a predator that had decided and whose deciding was the commitment and the commitment was the attack.

Rock lynx.

It came out of the undergrowth like geology made kinetic — grey-brown fur over muscle that was denser than normal, wider than normal, the specific proportions of a qi-enhanced beast whose enhancement had been happening for years in the wild, unguided, organic, the natural consequence of living in a qi-rich environment long enough for the body to absorb and compound and grow and the growing producing: this.

Wolf-height but broader. Seventy kilos of predatory mass moving at a speed that normal cats didn't reach. Qi-lines running through its fur like veins of light — pale blue, pulsing, the visual evidence of a system operating at combat readiness. Teeth: too long. The canines extended past what anatomy suggested because anatomy had been revised by qi and the revision was: longer, sharper, more.

Eyes: intelligent. Not human-intelligent — the specific intelligence of a territorial predator that had been challenged. Because Wei had been here for three weeks. Training, moving, broadcasting qi into a space that this animal considered owned. For three weeks, the lynx had been registering the intrusion. Evaluating. Deciding.

It had decided.

Wei's eyes opened.

The shift was instant — from training-trance to combat awareness, the switch that happened in the space between one heartbeat and the next and that said: the body knew before the mind knew and the mind was catching up and the catching up was fast because fast was what he was.

No weapon. He'd been training unarmed — the forms that didn't require steel, the hand-to-hand vocabulary that was the foundation beneath the blade work. His sword was at home, leaning against the wall beside his bed, being ornamental.

The lynx charged. Direct. No circling, no assessment, no territorial posturing. It was sure it would win. The assurance of something that had been apex here since before the settlement existed, that had fought other qi-beasts and won and whose winning was the evidence and the evidence was the directness — animals that circled were uncertain, animals that charged were confident.

Wei set his stance. Low. Qi flowing into his hands — not elegant, not refined, the raw channeling that combat demanded when refinement was a luxury and luxury was time and time was the lynx closing distance at eleven meters per second.

His hands: glowing. The gold-white luminescence of qi directed through flesh, the specific brightness that said: I have power and the power is available and the available is now.

"I can do this!"

The words — to himself, not to me, the self-address of someone reaching for confidence and finding it and the finding being genuine because the confidence was earned, was the product of months of training and years of surviving and the surviving being the credential and the credential being: I have been in danger before and I am still here.

I dropped from the branch.

The descent: controlled, silent, the three-meter fall converted to a landing that made no sound because sound was a choice and my choices were: land, assess, position. I stood at the clearing's edge. Eight meters from Wei. Close enough.

My hands: ready. My qi: suppressed but present — the coiled spring, the drawn bow, the metaphor that applied to potential energy held just beneath the threshold of release. I could intervene. I could cross eight meters in a fraction of a second. I could unmake this animal with a thought.

I could.

The lynx reached Wei.
