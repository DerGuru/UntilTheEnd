# Chapter 35

The celebration happened the way settlements celebrated — improvised, organic, the spontaneous assembly of people who had been frightened and were no longer frightened and whose no-longer-frightened produced the energy that required expression and expression required: fire, food, and noise.

Someone produced a flute. An old man — the same old man who produced a flute at every gathering because his flute was his contribution and his contribution was the sound and the sound was reedy and imperfect and exactly right because perfection was the enemy of celebration and celebration was this.

Food. The communal inventory of a settlement pooling its resources — dried meat, preserved vegetables, the good rice that someone had been saving for an occasion and the occasion being the earth no longer trying to kill them. Frau Huang cooked. Volume optional, quality mandatory.

Fire. Central. The gathering point around which bodies arranged themselves in the ancient geometry of community — the circle, the warmth, the democracy of a ring where everyone was equidistant from the heat.

Wei sat in the middle.

Not at the edge — not where I sat, cup in hand, back against a wall, the architecture of proximity-without-participation that was my register and had been my register for longer than this settlement had existed. In the middle. Among people. Part of them. The inclusion that said: I belong here, these are my people, this circle is mine.

He was talking. Animated. The post-crisis narration that he performed with the commitment that I had documented across three parts and seven lynx-retellings: embellishment as craft, exaggeration as enthusiasm, the truth as skeleton and the fiction as flesh.

"And the qi was PULLING—" His arms demonstrated the pulling. The pulling was significantly more dramatic in his version than in reality, where the pulling had been subtle and directional and had required concentration rather than arm gestures. "—and I had to channel EVERYTHING into the node, and the node was—"

He described the stabilization. The settlers listened. Not because the description was accurate — it wasn't — but because the describing was Wei and Wei was the person who had saved them and saved-people got to describe things however they wanted and however was the privilege and the privilege was the celebration.

"And then—"

The sentence.

The thing that happened.

Mid-word. Mid-gesture. Mid-grin. His voice — the voice that had been his voice for the entirety of the sentence and the entirety of the evening and the entirety of his life — changed.

"—the crack in the qi was—"

Deep. The word dropped an octave. More than an octave — the tonal shift that went beyond pitch into timber, into the fundamental frequency of the vocal apparatus, into the thing that made a voice a voice and that had been his and was momentarily not.

Older. As though the mouth that was producing the sound belonged to someone else — someone adult, someone whose vocal cords had been weathered by decades rather than formed by fourteen years. The maturity of a voice that had no business emerging from a boy who was currently sitting cross-legged in firelight describing qi-stabilization with his arms.

One sentence. Less than a sentence. Four words. The duration: approximately one and a half seconds. The aftermath: silence.

The settler beside Wei — a carpenter, forty-something, whose proximity was coincidental and whose coincidence was the evidence — looked at him. The look of someone who had heard something wrong and was processing the wrongness in real time. His face: confused. Briefly. The brief that was the mercy — he looked, he processed, he dismissed, because dismissing was easier than investigating and investigating led to questions and questions led to answers and answers were not what you wanted at a celebration.

Wei continued talking. Normal. His voice: his. The four words were gone, absorbed into the narrative, filed under: irrelevant, because irrelevant was the category that his consciousness used for things that his consciousness couldn't explain and couldn't explain was a category that his fourteen-year-old psychology was efficiently designed to populate and forget.

He hadn't noticed.

Not the shift. Not the settler's look. Not the, one-and-a-half-second window during which his voice had been someone else's and the someone else being the question and the question being a door and the door being one I would not open.

I sat against the wall. Tea — cold. The cup in both hands. The grip: tight. The tightness that was the physical expression of something that the body was doing because the mind was occupied with other things and the other things were the four words and the four words had been spoken in a voice that was—

Not his.

What was it? The interpretive options, listed without preference:

One: his core, distorting his physical output. The qi-instability expressing itself through the vocal cords, producing a temporary alteration in frequency. Mechanical. Physical. Explicable within the framework of core-degradation symptomology.

Two: his future self. The voice of who he would become if his body survived the core's trajectory — an older Wei, a deeper Wei, the Wei that existed on the other side of fourteen if fourteen had an other side. Temporal rather than mechanical. Speculative.

Three: something speaking through him. The core as conduit rather than source — channeling rather than producing, the voice belonging to an agency that was not Wei and that was using Wei's apparatus.

I didn't choose. Choosing required commitment and commitment required knowledge and knowledge required investigation and investigation required the context I was avoiding and the context was the frame and the frame was the thing.

The carpenter looked away. The celebration continued. The flute played. The food was eaten. The fire burned.

Wei grinned. Talked. Was Wei.

I held my tea. In the cold cup. In the tight hands. In the quiet.

Stage 2. The clock that had started with warmth and prickling and two-second respiratory arrests. That had progressed to trembling hands and clenched fists. That now included: voice.

The escalation chart. The symptom progression. The trajectory that I was mapping and that the map said led somewhere and the somewhere was the place I would not name because naming it was the thing and the thing was the word and the word was the end.

*Stage 3. What comes after voice?*

I didn't want to think about Stage 3.

The fire crackled. Wei laughed. Someone passed more food. The flute played its reedy, imperfect song.

I sat. Against the wall. In the cold. In the knowing.

Alone in it.
