# Chapter 9

Morning.

The kind of morning that existed to make a point. Sun through the window at the angle that said: today is available, today has arrived, today is offering itself to whoever will take it and the offer is sincere and the sincerity is the sunlight and the sunlight is warm and the warmth is the argument and the argument is: this.

Birds. Three species. I identified them by call because identification was reflex and reflex was function and function was the thing I did instead of the other things I could have been doing, which included sleeping, which I had not done, which was not unusual, which was fine.

Wei woke.

The process: a stretch — full-body, total commitment, the extension of every limb to its maximum reach as though sleep were a container he was climbing out of hand over foot and the climbing was energetic and the energy was the point. Then a yawn. Then eyes open: brown, alert, containing the brightness that fourteen produced when fourteen was healthy and rested and facing a morning and the morning was this morning and this morning was the kind of morning that existed to make a point.

He sat up. Pushed hair from his face. Noticed me in the doorway.

"How long have you been up?"

"A while."

"You should sleep." He said it the way he said most things now — as observation, not concern. The tone of someone who had catalogued the fact and filed it. Their filing system was his form of caring. Then: "Tea?"

"Already made."

He grinned. The grin that said I had already done the thing he was offering and his offering was therefore redundant and redundancy was funny because it proved we were synchronized and synchronization was his favorite thing because it was proof and proof was important and important was the currency of someone who had spent years unclear on whether he mattered and who now had evidence and the evidence was cold tea in a pot.

He dressed. Fast. The speed of purpose — putting on clothes not as preparation but as the first act of a day that had already started, that had started the moment his eyes opened, that had arguably started in his sleep because his body had been running momentum calculations while his consciousness was offline and the calculations had produced this: energy, direction, readiness.

"I'm going to Lao Chen's."

Stated. Not asked. The grammar of someone whose asking phase was over, had been over for weeks, was a past-tense construction that I remembered but that he had replaced with declaratives. Their declaratives were the sound of a boy who knew where he was going. Their knowing was the proof that the teaching had worked and the working was the goal and the goal was this.

"Tell him the second-form transition still drifts."

"I know. I felt it yesterday." He was already moving. Already at the door. Already halfway into the day while I was still standing in the doorway holding tea. "I'll fix it."

I'll fix it. Not: will you show me? Not: can you help? Not: what should I do? The pronoun shift. The grammatical evidence of autonomy. The verb-subject construction that said: I am the agent of my own correction and the correction is my project and the project is me and me is sufficient.

He stepped outside. Barefoot — the choice that was not laziness but preference, the commitment to direct contact with ground that was Wei's relationship with earth, tactile, immediate, the philosophy of someone who wanted to feel the thing he walked on because walking was the act and the act deserved sensation.

The sun hit his hair. Brown. With the gold that sun produced, the alchemy that light performed on dark hair when the angle was correct and the morning was this morning and this morning was making its point.

He ran.

Not jogging. Running. The run of someone for whom the distance between here and there was an invitation and invitations were accepted at full speed because speed was joy and joy was available and availability was not something he questioned anymore because availability was the given and the given was the settlement and the settlement was home and home was here.

Fast. Fourteen and fast. The velocity of a body that had been trained correctly and fed adequately and that had spent three months learning that morning came after night and that night was for sleeping and sleeping was safe and safety was the floor from which speed launched.

He turned the corner. The corner — past Frau Huang's house, past the garden wall, past the point where the path bent toward Lao Chen's workshop and the workshop was the destination and the destination was certain and certainty was the thing in his stride and his stride was the evidence.

He didn't look back.

Not once. Not the glance over the shoulder that said: are you there? Not the half-turn that said: I'm checking. Not the pause that said: I need to verify your presence before I continue into the distance. None of it. Because he wasn't uncertain. Because looking back was for people who doubted what they were leaving behind, and he didn't doubt me. I was the constant. I was the wall at his back, the tea in the pot, the correction he no longer needed but that was available, that was always available, that was the architecture of his world. Their architecture was so reliable that verifying it was unnecessary.

He didn't look back because he was sure.

I stood in the doorway. Tea in my hand. The cold version. The version that was consistent and available and mine in the way that cold tea was always mine because warm tea required timing and timing required presence and presence was the thing I was spending on him and the spending was the transaction and the transaction was complete. Had been complete for months. Was completing itself daily in the rhythm of: he wakes, he goes, he comes back, he's fine.

The sun on the path where he'd run. The dust his feet had lifted, settling. The particular quality of air after someone has moved through it quickly and left the air changed — warmer, displaced, still vibrating at the frequency of passage.

The garden. Three pots. The dock grass, vertical and wrong and committed. The nettle-cousin, producing its ambiguous stalk. The lemongrass, being correct by accident. The blade fragment on the wall, catching morning light. The two stones. The stone from his first exploration — grey-blue, river-smooth — sitting between the second pot and the third pot, placed there by hands that knew where things belonged because belonging was the project and the project was ongoing and the ongoing was the point.

Morning. This morning. The kind that existed to make a point.

*It's going to be fine. Maybe. This time.*

The sun. The dust. The three pots. The stone.

He turned the corner and was gone.

He didn't look back.
