# Chapter 44

Grey morning.

No sun. The sky — flat, low, the colour of metal left in rain.

I was at the west wall. High. Barriers humming under my palms — the signs I'd carved last night, my qi in the stone, functional, alive.

The first qi-blast hit the horizon. East. A line of white-blue light cutting through the grey.

Then two more. Then four more. Seven total. Coordinated — each blast offset by precisely two seconds. A unit that had rehearsed. Guo.

The well-gong. Someone swinging the hammer. The metallic toll spread across the settlement, bouncing off walls, off roofs, off barriers. Alarm.

Movement below. Fast. Fragmented. The settlement waking into emergency — women and children toward the escape routes, men toward the walls, tools in hands. My protection signs at the doors: glowing faintly as people passed through them.

Frau Huang: at her door. Shen beside her — the boy, twelve, the one who followed Wei everywhere.

She pushed him toward the southern escape route. He resisted. She pushed harder. Hands on shoulders, turning him, aiming him toward the trees.

He went. She watched him go. Turned back.

The qi-blasts: closer. East perimeter. My barriers: absorbing, deflecting. They would hold against this level. But the blasts were not the point. Behind them — bodies in formation, the signatures I'd tracked for days.

Eight. Plus Guo.

Wei.

He came through the door. Not from sleep — from readiness. Sword in his right hand. Lao Chen's blade. Bare feet. The light at his sternum bleeding through fabric, a second heartbeat visible in the grey morning air.

He ran.

Across the central path, between the houses, toward the east gate. Fast, direct, the straight line between himself and the fight.

He didn't look back.

I tracked from the west wall. The formation: east gate — primary assault. South-west — two signatures flanking. North — one, holding position.

Containment. Not siege. Guo wanted Wei, and Wei was running toward where the wanting waited.

A qi-blast hit the east wall. Stone cracked. My barrier absorbed the follow-through — dispersed it. The crack: cosmetic. The barrier: functional.

Another blast. Another. Two-second intervals. The rehearsed pattern.

I stayed at the west wall. High. Overview.

Below: settlers at the walls with farming tools — shovels, hoes. Not soldiers. Civilians with steel.

Wei at the east gate. Standing in the opening. Sword up. Qi flaring.

And west — behind me, beyond me, two hundred paces into the treeline — something else.

A signature.

Not Guo's people. Not sect. Something larger. Deeper. The kind of presence that displaced the air around it and whose displacement was the announcement: I am here.

I marked it. Filed it.

Wei was about to fight.

CHANGES MADE — EISERNE REGEL ENFORCEMENT:
1. [CRITICAL] Deleted "Part 1" meta-references: "Not the golden morning of Part 1" → removed entirely. "identical — to Part 1, Chapter 9: running to Lao Chen's, not looking back, the morning receding behind him" → replaced with "the straight line between himself and the fight."
2. [HIGH] E:R ratio improved ~50:50 → ~65:35 (action-dominant):
   - Morning cascade: 3 lines → 1
   - Position cascade: 3 lines → 2
   - Movement cascade: 4 lines → 2
   - Frau Huang cascade: 3 lines → 1
   - Blasts cascade: 3 lines → 2
   - Containment cascade: 3 lines → 1
   - Wei-door cascade: 3 lines → 2
   - Signature cascade: 3 lines → 2
3. [HIGH] Deleted 4× "specific" tic
4. [MED] Broke 10+ "whose" chains
5. EISERNE REGEL COMPLIANT: No flashbacks, no memories, no explanations. Pure perception + action.
6. PRESERVED: Grey morning, qi-blasts sequence, well-gong alarm, Frau Huang + Shen evacuation, Wei with sword + bare feet + core-light, runs east/doesn't look back, formation tracking, Immortal-stage signature (west), "Wei was about to fight" ending
