# Chapter 31

The well.

The settlement's gathering point — the only structure that belonged to everyone, the shared infrastructure of a community whose community was expressed through water and water was the thing that brought them together now, standing in a circle around the stone rim with the metal taste in their mouths and the headaches in their temples and the dogs still barking.

The elder — not an elder in the cultivation sense, an elder in the farming sense: sixty-three, weathered, the kind of authority that came from having been here longest and having survived longest and survival being the credential — stood at the well's edge and said the thing that no one else was willing to say:

"The qi is — wrong? Can anyone—?"

He stopped. Because he didn't know how to finish. Because the vocabulary of qi-crisis was not in his inventory — his inventory was: rain, drought, blight, the ordinary agricultural catastrophes that had ordinary agricultural solutions. This was not ordinary. This was the earth itself being sick in a language he didn't speak.

Looks.

The looks went to Wei.

Not to me. Not to Lao Chen, who was old and who worked with metal. Their metal-working tangentially involved qi in the way that all craftsmanship tangentially involved qi but whose tangential involvement was not the same as competence. Not to Heiler Mao, who was present. Their presence was medical. Their medical was bones and fevers, not qi-flows and geological destabilization.

To Wei.

Because Wei was the cultivator. The only cultivator. The one who trained in the clearing and who fought rock lynxes and who carried wounded woodcutters. Their carrying was the evidence and the evidence was: this boy can do things. This boy understands the language that the earth is speaking. This boy is fourteen and has scars and glowing hands and the quality of someone who is more than the rest of us. Their more-ness is our hope.

Wei felt the looks. I watched him feel them — the arrival of collective attention, the weight of twenty-seven pairs of eyes and the weight being the expectation and the expectation being: help us.

He stood up.

The standing. Not the casual stand of leaving a chair — the deliberate rise of someone accepting a role. The posture that said: I am here, I have heard you, I will respond.

"The qi source is northeast," he said. "At the mountain slope. I've felt it — it's shifted. If we can stabilize it—"

He organized. The, natural, unbidden organization that came from someone who didn't know he was organizing because organizing was a function rather than a decision. Four groups. He assigned them with the clarity that martial training produced — the decisiveness that came from forms and practice and the understanding that in crisis, hesitation was the enemy.

"First group — find the source. I'll lead. Anyone who can carry supplies."

"Second — secure the fields. Move what you can. The grain first — it's the most vulnerable."

"Third — anyone with medical knowledge, go to the sick. Water and shade for the headaches. Mao — can you?"

Heiler Mao nodded. Already moving.

"Fourth — barriers. Dig channels around the north-facing structures. If the soil shifts further—"

He was right. About all of it. The sequence, the priorities, the distribution of labor — he had assessed the situation, identified the resources, allocated them optimally. Not perfectly — there were inefficiencies that I could see and that he couldn't see because his experience was fourteen years and mine was considerably more. But the inefficiencies were minor. The structure was sound.

Frau Huang stood at the edge of the circle. Her son beside her — for once, close, the unusual proximity of a boy who was usually gone by dawn being present at his mother's side because the wrongness of the morning had penetrated even his twelve-year-old imperviousness.

"The boy knows what he's doing," she said. To no one. To everyone. The Frau Huang broadcast — the statement delivered at the volume that ensured universal reception. Their reception was the point.

I stood apart. Tea — cold. The cup in my hand. The position of the observer — outside the circle, outside the organization, outside the thing that was happening and the thing being: Wei, in the center, surrounded by adults who were listening to him. Fourteen. Clearer than anyone in the circle. The competence of someone who was not more experienced but more certain. Their certainty was the compass and the compass pointing: this way.

Pride. The, genuine, brief warmth that I felt — rare, measured in fractions of seconds, the involuntary response of someone who had built something. Their something was performing. Their performance was the evidence and the evidence was: the teaching worked.

Then: the other thing.

He didn't need me. Not here. Not now. Not in this circle where he was organizing and delegating and being the thing that the settlement required and the requiring being him and him being sufficient.

That was the goal. Had always been the goal. The explicit, articulated, philosophical goal that I had constructed and maintained and that said: make him capable of functioning without you.

He was. Functioning. Without me.

And the functioning was the proof.

And the proof was the absence.

And the absence was the thing.
