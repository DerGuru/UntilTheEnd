# Chapter 32

The north slope gave way at midday.

Not gradually — the instant of geological failure that happened when qi-destabilized soil exceeded its friction coefficient and the exceeding was total and the total was the slide. Rocks, earth, ancient root systems torn from their moorings — the material vocabulary of collapse expressed in the language of mass and momentum.

Three buildings. The structures nearest the slope — a storage barn, a half-built extension, the wall of someone's kitchen. Hit. The barn: collapsed inward, the structural integrity compromised at the foundation, the walls folding with the finality of wood that had been asked to bear more than it could. The extension: crumpled. The kitchen wall: cracked, leaning, held together by stubbornness and mortar.

Screaming. The ambient sound of crisis — the human vocalization that existed beneath words and above silence, the frequency of fear that was universal and had been universal for every era I had witnessed and whose witnessing was the experience and the experience was: this sound never changes.

Wei ran.

Not to the buildings — to the people. The priority hierarchy that was correct: people first, structures second. The triage of someone whose instincts were built right.

"You — get water. You — support the roof. You — get the children away."

Fourteen. Saying these things with the voice that was not a fourteen-year-old's voice — the register of command that emerged when the situation demanded command and the situation was demanding and Wei was providing and the providing was natural, organic, the thing he was rather than the thing he'd learned.

The settlers obeyed. Not because he was their leader — because he was clear. In the chaos, in the dust and the screaming and the geological debris, he was the one person who was providing instruction that made sense and sense was the thing they needed and he was the thing that provided it.

He directed. Moved through the rubble — lifting debris with qi-enhanced strength, supporting a beam while three settlers pulled a man from underneath, compressing his qi into structural reinforcement for a wall that was about to fall on someone's children.

Competent. Faster than competent — inspired. The quality of someone who was not merely responding to crisis but was energized by it, whose capacity expanded under pressure because pressure was the medium and the medium was his element.

I helped. Quietly. In the margins — lifting things from angles that no one was watching, reinforcing walls from the outside while they reinforced from the inside, performing the structural interventions that were invisible because invisible was my register and my register was the background and the background was where I operated when the foreground was him.

Frau Huang appeared beside me. Her son: running — somewhere, the directional uncertainty of a twelve-year-old whose response to crisis was: motion, any motion, motion as the expression of the inability to be still.

"Yun."

I looked at her. Her face: the face of a mother whose son was running somewhere and whose somewhere was the concern and the concern was the thing she was about to share.

"When he's with Wei — when they play in the garden or whatever — just keep an eye on him? You know how they are at that age. You turn around and they're gone."

You turn around and they're gone.

She said it casually. The casualness of someone for whom this was domestic — child management, the logistics of mothers who co-parented by proximity and whose proximity was the settlement and the settlement being the arrangement.

I nodded.

Said nothing.

The nod that was the promise. The implicit contract — I'll watch him, I'll keep him in range, I'll be the ambient surveillance that mothers borrowed from the nearest reliable adult and the nearest reliable adult being me and the reliability being my function.

You turn around and they're gone.

The sentence. Sitting in my chest. Heavy. The kind of heavy that was not weight but prophecy — the forward-echo of words that would acquire meaning later and whose later-meaning I couldn't know yet and couldn't prevent yet and couldn't do anything about yet because yet was the word and the word was the limitation.

Wei emerged from the rubble. Dusty, tired, arms scored with small cuts from jagged debris. He'd helped pull six people from damaged structures. He'd stabilized two walls. He'd directed a team of adults twice his age.

He looked at me. Across the wreckage. Through the dust.

The grin. Dimmer — exhaustion, adrenaline withdrawal, the physical cost of crisis-management at fourteen. But present.

I looked back. Held the nod. The promise I'd made — casually, implicitly, to a loud woman about her deaf son.

Later: I would not keep it. Later: the turning-around would happen. Later: the gone would be permanent.

But that was later.

Now: the buildings. The rubble. The people. Wei in the dust, grinning, having saved everyone he could reach.

You turn around.
