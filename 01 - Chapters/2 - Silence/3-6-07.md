# Chapter 50

I was beside him. I don't remember the wall, the distance, the descent. The space between standing on the wall and kneeling in the dirt was absent — not forgotten but nonexistent, the lacuna of a body that had moved without consulting the mind and whose moving was instantaneous because instantaneous was the only speed available.

He was on his back. Turned — by the fall, by gravity, by the mechanics of a body settling into the position that gravity chose. Arms out. Legs straight.

His hands: open. Palms up. The skin: torn along the qi-channels. Blood — real blood, dark, mixing with the residue of qi-discharge that was translucent and cooling.

His chest: still. The shirt: the light was gone. The fabric that had been illuminated from within for weeks — from the door, from across the room, from wherever you stood in proximity to this body — was just fabric now. Cotton. Grey, originally white. The stain where tea had spilled on Tuesday. The tear at the shoulder where the felsluchs had clawed and the claw had healed to a scar.

The scar was there. Diagonal. Across the shoulder. White against skin that was still warm because warmth took time to leave and leaving was a process and the process was the thing that was happening.

His face: young.

Fourteen.

The angles of jaw that had been changing — the transition from child to not-child that adolescence performed in increments, one millimeter per week, the slow restructuring that became visible only in comparison to the version you remembered and the remembering was the only measurement available. The angles were there. Half-formed. The nose: his father's, probably. The chin: someone's. The features that belonged to the person who had lived behind them and whose living was no longer occurring.

His eyes: open.

Staring. At the sky. The grey sky of the grey morning that I had noted and that he had not noted because noting mornings was not his function and his function was: fight, run, shout, live.

The grey reflected in his eyes. The surface of iris and fluid that mirrors caught and that mirrors held and that was not looking but was. His eyes: catching the sky that he was no longer seeing.

I knelt. Beside him. Close — closer than I normally positioned, the distance contracted by the circumstances and the circumstances being what they were.

My knee: in the dirt. The same dirt that he lay in, the same ground that the false scout had lain in, the same open terrain that Guo had designated as the killzone. Dirt. Under my knee, getting into the fabric.

A scratch. On my forearm. Left. From the wall — the descent, the rough stone, the speed that had not accounted for surface texture. Small. Not painful. Irrelevant.

It closed. As I knelt there. The skin: drawing together, the cells reconnecting, the acceleration of tissue repair that my body performed automatically, unconsciously, the healing that was not healing but regeneration and the regeneration was the nature and the nature was immortal and immortal was: I heal. Always. From everything. Without trying. Without asking. Without consent.

The scratch: gone. In seconds. The skin: smooth. As if nothing had happened. As if the wall and the descent and the speed had not occurred.

His body: lying there.

The torn hands: not healing. The qi-channel ruptures along his palms: open. The blood: still emerging, slowly, the residual pressure of a cardiovascular system that had not yet fully stopped because stopping was a process and the process took minutes.

The contrast was: I healed. He didn't.

Not a thought. Not a sentence. A perception. The observation of a body that healed beside a body that didn't. Automatic alongside permanent. My scratch: gone. His everything: remaining.

I did not touch his face.

My hand: at my side. The distance between my hand and his face: measurable. Small. The distance of someone who could reach but who did not reach because reaching was the gesture of the living to the dead and the gesture was intimate and the intimacy was the thing I denied every time because denying was the only protection I had and the protection was against what would happen if I touched the thing I had lost and the touching made the losing real and the real was the thing I could not—

I did not touch his face.

His hair: sweaty. Flattened against his forehead. The configuration of post-combat hair that I had seen on him after training, after the felsluchs, after every physical effort. This configuration identical to those. This configuration: the last one.

The boy on the ground behind us: Shen. Alive. Crying. I could see him in peripheral vision — twelve years old, unhurt, the posture of a child who has witnessed something that children should not witness and whose witnessing was the thing that would live in him forever.

The silence continued. The world: soundless. My perception: receiving visual information without auditory accompaniment, the sensory editing that trauma performed on bodies that experienced it and whose experience was the shutdown and the shutdown was selective and the selection was sound.

I knelt beside Wei.

His core: dark. Not dim, not flickering, not the oscillation that I had tracked. Dark. The absence of qi-signature that occurred when the thing producing the signature ceased to produce. A cold body. A dark core. An empty channel system.

The word for this was dead.
