# Chapter 59

The rain stopped.

Wind. The movement of air that occurred when weather systems exhaled — the front passing, the pressure equalizing, the atmosphere deciding that water was finished and air was next.

Forest. Standing. The brown circle under my feet. The trees: weakened but upright. The moss on their trunks: dried at the edges. Everything around me: less alive, by the margin that my presence subtracted and the subtracting was the tax and the tax was: me.

I stood.

My left forearm. The scratch — the one from the wall, the descent, the speed. The scratch that had healed. Automatically. In seconds. While I knelt beside a body that didn't heal. While I pressed my knee into the same dirt that held a boy whose torn hands would remain torn.

The scratch was gone. The skin: smooth. Unblemished. The surface of a body that did not retain damage because retaining damage was the function of bodies that experienced time linearly and I did not experience time linearly and the non-experience was the condition and the condition was: I healed.

Always.

From everything.

A cut: healed. A wound: healed. Everything healed. Everything always healed. That was the problem.

Everything that happened to this body: reversed. Corrected. Returned to the template that existed before the damage. Their template was the default and the default was: intact. Always intact. Immutably, constitutionally, architecturally intact.

This body. This exact, personal, individual body that walked through forests and killed grass and sat beside dead students and watched them not-heal while it healed and the watching was the contrast and the contrast was the question.

The question.

It had been forming. Since Part 6. Since the scratch closed and the hands didn't close and the closing-and-not-closing was the simultaneity that produced the question. Not suddenly — gradually, the way pressure built behind a dam, molecule by molecule, each molecule a detail, each detail a drop, each drop adding to the mass that would eventually breach the structure.

It breached.

Not as thought. As sound. Mouth open, voice active, the transition from internal to external that occurred when internal could no longer contain and containing was the dam and the dam was: broken.

"Whatever protects me — why not him?"

Aloud. Into the forest. At the trees, the air, the moss, the wind, the world that was present and indifferent and present in its indifference.

The words: seven. Simple. The kind of words that children used when asking about fairness — the fundamental vocabulary of disparity that required no sophistication because sophistication was the disguise and the disguise was unnecessary when the thing being said was: why.

Why was I protected? Why did the protection extend to me — always, automatically, without request or consent — and not to him? Why did the same force, the same whatever-it-was, the same nameless thing that closed my scratches and healed my wounds and maintained my body like a museum maintaining an exhibit — why did it not extend to the boy who stood next to me? Who lived in my house? Who ate my food? Who fought with my training? Who existed in my proximity — my close, personal, daily proximity —. Their proximity should have been the connection and the connection should have been the conduit and the conduit should have conducted the protection the way walls conducted my barriers?

Why did the walls hold and his core didn't?

Why did my barriers work and his body didn't?

Why was I the thing that was protected and he the thing that was not?

The words disappeared between the trees. No echo. The forest absorbed them the way forests absorbed everything — patiently, silently, with the digestion of an organism that converted sound into mulch and mulch into floor and floor into more forest.

No answer.

The forest did not answer because forests did not answer because answering required agency and agency required intent and intent required the kind of engagement that the universe reserved for beings who engaged and the universe was not a being and the not-being was the answer and the answer was: nothing.

I stood in the forest with my question and the question stood with me and neither of us had an answer and neither of us would have one today.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [CRITICAL]: Eiserne Regel violation — deleted 3 historical memories (broken rib / siege of Lin'an / sword through abdomen) from P7 chapter; replaced with present-tense "Everything healed. Everything always healed. That was the problem."
- Applied Global Patterns: P7 = no specific historical memories; sensation and present-state only
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The healing litany now hits harder through universality rather than enumeration — "That was the problem" is the knife
