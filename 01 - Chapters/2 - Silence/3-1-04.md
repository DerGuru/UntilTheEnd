# Chapter 4

Wei cooked.

Not "helped with cooking." Not "participated in the food preparation process under supervision." Cooked. Independently. With the confidence of someone who had decided that this was a domain he owned. Their ownership had been acquired not through permission but through practice. Their practice had been conducted when I wasn't looking. Their not-looking was deliberate on my part and strategic on his and the combined effect was that one morning I walked into the kitchen and he was cutting vegetables like an adult.

The knife moved. Fast. Precise. The same wrist rotation I'd seen in his sword training — the biomechanical economy of someone who had discovered that cutting was cutting regardless of the medium and that the principle transferred and that the transfer was a kind of genius that nobody would call genius because it was about vegetables and vegetables didn't come with accolades.

Carrots. Radish. Something green that I didn't recognize and that he'd acquired from the market or the forest or the neighbor's garden through methods he hadn't disclosed and that I hadn't investigated because investigating was monitoring and monitoring was the thing I was trying to do less of and doing less of was harder than doing more of because more was my default and less required intention.

"How did you—"

"Taught myself."

Two words. Delivered without looking up. Without pausing the knife. Without the self-consciousness that would have indicated he was aware of the significance of what he was demonstrating and that the demonstration was for my benefit and that the benefit was information about his trajectory, which was away from me, not in the physical sense but in the functional sense, in the sense that the space labeled "things Wei needs Yun for" was contracting at a rate that was measurable and that I was measuring and that the measurement produced a number and the number was smaller than yesterday's.

He'd learned from the Loud Mother. That was my name for Frau Huang — the neighbor three doors down whose primary characteristic was volume. Their volume was deployed in the service of managing a household that included a son who treated parental instructions as atmospheric events: acknowledged in principle, disregarded in practice.

Frau Huang cooked the way she spoke — with conviction and amplitude. Her kitchen produced sounds that traveled. Flavors that asserted themselves. Rice that had opinions about texture. She had taught Wei — or Wei had taught himself by existing in her proximity, which for Wei was the same thing, because Wei's learning was not the passive reception of instruction but the active extraction of method from observation and the observation was constant and the extraction was ruthless and the combination produced competence without the intervening stage of incompetence that normal learning required.

"The radish is thin," I said.

"It cooks faster that way."

"You're cutting it on the bias."

"Frau Huang says bias cuts release more flavor."

"Frau Huang is not wrong."

He looked up. Brief. The look of someone who had received validation from a source whose validation mattered and who was pleased by it and who was immediately embarrassed by being pleased because pleasure at validation implied dependence on the validator and dependence was the thing he was working on reducing and the reduction was my success and my loss and both at the same time.

Afternoon. Training.

He trained differently now. The base exercises — the ones I'd given him in the first weeks, the fundamentals of qi-circulation and physical integration — were still there, but they'd been modified. Adapted. The way a building's foundation is adapted when the building's purpose changes — same structural principles, different load distribution, different angles, different relationship between the parts and the whole.

The modifications were his. Not mine. Not Xu Ran's borrowed stability principles, which he'd integrated months ago and which had become part of his foundation, invisible now, load-bearing, absorbed. These were new. Innovations that emerged from a mind that understood its own body's relationship with qi in ways that I couldn't teach because the teaching would have required experiencing what he experienced and I experienced something different and the difference was the gap and the gap was a kind of freedom — his freedom, to develop along his own trajectory, uncontaminated by my assumptions about what the trajectory should look like.

His form was precise. Not just technically — aesthetically. The movements had a quality that went beyond correct into the territory of personal, the signature that each cultivator developed over time that was as individual as handwriting and as revealing and that told me, watching from the fence, that Wei's cultivation was no longer a copy of what I'd provided but a translation of it into his own language and his own language was fluent and distinctive and would have been recognizable from any distance by anyone who had seen it once.

I sat on the fence. Watched. Said nothing.

He finished. Wiped sweat from his face with his forearm. Looked at me — the reflexive glance of someone seeking evaluation, the habit that hadn't died even as the dependence on the evaluation diminished.

"How was that?"

"Fine."

"Fine?"

"Fine."

He waited. The waiting of someone who expected more and who knew that "fine" from me was a placeholder and that the placeholder could contain anything from genuine approval to critical concern and that the ambiguity was either laziness or deliberate and that either way it was unsatisfying and the dissatisfaction was another piece of evidence in the growing case for his own judgment and against the reliance on mine.

He nodded. Went to the well. Drank water. Came back.

"I changed the third sequence," he said. "The hip rotation — it wasn't right for my frame. Too wide. I narrowed it. Half a degree."

"I noticed."

"And?"

"Half a degree is correct."

He stood there. Dripping. Fourteen. The geometry of a body that was growing into itself, that was discovering its dimensions through the practical process of using them, that was becoming what it would be through the accumulation of half-degrees and small corrections and the patient, persistent work of living inside a form and adjusting the form from within.

He didn't need me to tell him it was correct. He knew it was correct. He'd felt it — the proprioceptive confirmation that came from a modification that improved efficiency, the body's silent "yes" that arrived when the angle was right and the qi-flow matched and the movement became not easier but more natural, which was different, which was the difference between removing resistance and finding alignment.

He knew. He didn't need me.

The thought settled. Not painfully — with the gravity of a fact that had been approaching for months and that had arrived. Their arrival was neither surprising nor comfortable. Their discomfort was the price of success. Their success was the plan and the plan had worked.

*He doesn't need me.*

The thought's second iteration was smaller. Quieter. The echo that came after the initial impact, the reverb that was softer but more persistent, the sound that stayed in the room after the sound itself had ended.

*That was the goal. Always.*

I went inside. Made tea. The door stuck. I hit it with my hip. It opened.

The house smelled like radish. Bias-cut, by a boy who'd taught himself, released flavor and all.
