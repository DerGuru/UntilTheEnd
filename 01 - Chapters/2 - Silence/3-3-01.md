# Chapter 20

Forest edge.

The clearing where Wei trained — a quarter-mile from the settlement, through the tree line, past the stream that was too small for a name and too persistent for absence, the kind of water source that existed because geography allowed it and geography was permissive here and permissiveness was the quality and the quality was peace.

He moved.

Barefoot on moss. The green compression of ancient organic matter under the feet of a boy whose feet knew this ground now — every root, every depression, every patch of stone that interrupted the softness with the hardness of geological fact. He'd trained here every morning for three weeks. The ground knew him. He knew it.

His qi flowed.

Clean. Fast. The kind of fast that wasn't rushed — that was efficient, that was the velocity of a system operating at high capacity without strain, the rhythm of someone whose body had been tuned by practice and proximity to competence. Their proximity was me and me was sitting on a branch three meters up with cold tea and observation.

His forms: his. Not mine — not anymore, not entirely. The foundation was mine: the stances, the transitions, the structural grammar of movement that I had demonstrated and that he had absorbed. But layered over that foundation was something that was only his — the adaptations, the flourishes, the dialect of combat that emerged when a student spent enough time with the teacher's language to begin speaking their own. The way he extended the third position a half-inch past orthodox. The compression of the sixth-form exit. The hip correction.

I sat on the branch. Legs hanging. Tea — cold, forgotten, the habitual temperature of inattention. My perception: split. Half on his form — assessing, comparing to yesterday's data, to last week's, to the trajectory model that I maintained and updated and that told me what I didn't want to know. Half on the forest — ambient, scanning, the sentinel function that operated whether I wanted it to or not.

His qi: fast. Faster than yesterday. The acceleration was subtle — measurable only by someone who had been measuring for months. Their measurement was precise enough to detect the delta between 97 and 99 percent of his theoretical maximum output. Yesterday: 97. Today: 99.

For a normal cultivator observing this: impressive. A talented fourteen-year-old whose qi-flow approached his ceiling with the grace that training produced. They would nod. They would say: well-taught.

For me: the 99 was the concern. Not because 99 was dangerous — 99 was fine. Because 99 at fourteen meant 100 at fourteen and a month, and 100 was the ceiling, and ceilings were the things that broke when the force beneath them exceeded structural tolerance.

He finished. Stood. Eyes closed. Breathing — even, controlled, the measured respiration of someone whose post-exercise protocol was disciplined because discipline was the substrate of everything he did.

Then: opened his eyes. Looked up. At me.

Grinned.

The grin of someone who knew he was being watched. Their knowing was the comfort and the comfort was the tree and the tree was the branch and the branch was me and me was here. Always here.

"How was it?" he called up.

"Your sixth-form exit is rushing."

"It's supposed to be fast."

"Fast and rushing are different."

He considered this. The considering of someone who respected the distinction. Their respect was genuine — he heard the difference between velocity-as-design and velocity-as-impatience and the difference was the lesson and the lesson was landing.

"I'll fix it."

He would. He always did. The fixing was the skill and the skill was the evidence and the evidence was the trajectory and the trajectory was—

Sun through the leaves. Warm. Green. The quality of morning forest light that was filtered and dappled and gentle and that said: this is a good place, this is a safe place, this place is for training and birds and cold tea on branches and the persistent trickle of an unnamed stream.

The last morning like this.

I didn't know that yet. Or I did — in the way that I knew everything, the ambient, sub-threshold, body-level knowledge that existed beneath conscious processing and that produced the feeling that was not a feeling but a forecast and the forecast was: something is coming and coming is soon and soon is the tree and the moss and the boy and the grin and the sun.

He went back to training. Repeated the sixth-form. Slower. The correction a gift I gave without moving.

I drank my tea. Cold. Watched the sun move through the leaves.

Peace.
