# Chapter 36

Night.

The settlement slept. The post-celebration sleep — deeper, heavier, the specific quality of rest that followed relief and food and firelight and the combination of all three producing the kind of unconsciousness that was earned and total.

Wei slept. His face: peaceful. The specific peace of someone who had saved twenty-seven people and stabilized a qi-source and been celebrated and was now processing all of it through the medium of complete unconsciousness.

His core.

I knelt. The arrangement. Knees, floor, hand, two centimeters. The ritual that had become the architecture of my nights and that was producing data that I filed and that the filing said: worse, getting worse, the progression continues.

Flicker.

Not the steady glow of his core at rest — the unsteady, visible, through-the-shirt flicker that said: the core is not resting. The core is processing. The core is still resonating from the output of today and the resonating is excessive and the excessive is the diagnostic.

I counted.

Five.

Five twitches per minute.

Part one: three. Part two: four. Part three: four, irregular. Now: five. The numbers. The progression. The function whose shape I could see — not a line, not linear, the upward curve of a parabola whose parabola was the trend and the trend was the acceleration and the acceleration was: it's getting faster.

Each stage faster than the last. The intervening intervals shortening. The time between escalation points compressing. The arithmetic of a system approaching its limit, the specific mathematics of structures under progressive stress that produced the curve that produced the forecast and the forecast—

I withdrew my hand.

His blanket. Higher. The care gesture. Automatic. The hands that had held the cave wall and the cold tea and the cup with the tight grip now performing the most basic, most ancient, most inescapable act of care: covering a sleeping body against the cold that wasn't cold.

I went outside.

The night. The stars. The garden.

His garden. The three pots — recovering now from the qi-disruption. The dock grass: still wilted, but less. The nettle-cousin: sealed bloom beginning to open. The lemongrass: resilient, vertical, being correct.

Because Wei had fixed the source. Because Wei had gone into the cave and channeled his qi and stabilized the flows and the flows were normal now and the normal was the gift and the gift was from him.

He saved the fields. The harvests. The water quality. The headaches. He saved Frau Huang's chickens and Lao Chen's forge-fire and the unnamed grain and the dock grass and the nettle-cousin.

He saved everything.

The word that kept arriving. The specific word in the memory — the man, the city, the square that would be named. He saved everything.

And the saving was the cost.

And the cost was the core.

And the core was the clock.

And the clock was the thing.

*Five twitches. Parabolic curve. Factors of acceleration: combat deployment, emotional intensity, ambient qi-interaction. The curve suggests—*

I stopped.

The calculation. The forecast. The specific, mathematical, undeniable number that the curve produced when I extended it and that the extension provided and that the provision was—

I drank my tea. Cold. The swallow of liquid that served as the physical interruption of cognitive process. The trick that worked because the body's involvement in the act of swallowing required the brief diversion of neural resources and the brief diversion was enough to break the thought-chain and the thought-chain needed breaking.

Stars. The indifferent stars. The stars that had been there for the man in the city and would be there for the boy in the settlement and whose there-ness was the continuity and the continuity was the cruelty and the cruelty was the universe not caring and the universe not caring being the feature and the feature being: eternal, unchanging, indifferent.

I was not supposed to care either. The design — the thing I was, the thing I had been, the system that produced me and whose producing had included specifications and whose specifications had included parameters and whose parameters had included a word that was close to indifferent and that was the word I could not remember because not-remembering was the condition and the condition was: I was no longer what I was designed to be.

I cared.

The word. The admission. The specific, quiet, nighttime acknowledgment that I made to the garden and the stars and the tea and to no one because no one was the audience and the audience was sufficient.

I cared about the boy. I cared about his core. I cared about the five and the parabola and the trajectory. I cared about the grin and the scar and the hip correction and the victory and the voice that had shifted.

And caring was the problem. Because caring without acting was the torture that the principle imposed. And acting without his permission was the violation that caring prevented. And the paradox — care demands action, principle prohibits it, the two in permanent deadlock — was the architecture of my nights and the architecture was: standing in a garden with cold tea and five twitches per minute and the thought I wouldn't finish.

His proudest day. His most dangerous day. And he would never know they were the same day.

The garden. The pots. The stone.

The stars.

Morning would come. He would wake. He would be proud and tired and fourteen and the world would call him hero and heroism would be the fuel and the fuel would feed the core and the core would tick.

Five. Per minute.

I stayed.
