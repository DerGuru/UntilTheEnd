# Chapter 13

Evening.

The kitchen. Clay walls, wooden table, two cups, a pot. The table had a gouge near the edge where Wei had dropped a blade during an unsanctioned indoor demonstration. The gouge was permanent.

He stood. I sat. The geometry of conversations that mattered.

"There was someone at the market. From a sect. Iron Lotus."

I looked up. Not because I didn't know — I'd known since the herb stall, since the chrysanthemum. I looked up because looking up was the performance of learning something, and the performance was what he needed. He needed to be the one telling me.

"He said my talent is—"

"Wasted?"

He blinked. His prepared speech, anticipated. Annoying.

"—unusual."

"That's a different word."

"It's the word he used."

The kettle on the stove clicked — the sound of cooling iron contracting. Outside, a dog barked twice and stopped.

"They offer training. Real masters. Not just—"

He stopped.

The air in the room changed. The pressure of a word about to arrive and then not arriving. A syllable that existed in his mouth and that he chose, at the last possible moment, not to release.

Not just you.

That was it. Three words. One pronoun. The one he'd dismantled at the threshold. The dismantling was a kindness — and a confession, because it said: I know what I almost said, and I know what it would mean.

I picked up my cup. Set it down again. The tea was cold.

"The what," I said. Flat.

He looked at the table. The gouge.

"They offer training," he said. Quietly. "That's all I'm saying."

"Good."

He shifted his weight. Leaned against the counter, arms crossed, then uncrossed. Picked up the kettle, put it back. The nervous choreography of a boy delivering difficult information to someone who received all information the same way.

"You're angry."

"No."

"You're something."

True. I was something. Something between angry and afraid that had no name, not in this kitchen, not yet.

"I'm drinking tea," I said.

He almost smiled.

"Okay," he said.

"Okay."

He sat. Finally. Poured himself tea — grimaced at the temperature but drank it anyway. Looked at the table. Looked at me. Looked at the table.

"I'm not going," he said. "I'm just — I'm telling you."

"I know."

"You always know."

"Not always."

Wind through the gap under the door. The candle on the counter bent sideways, recovered. Wei tracked it with his eyes the way he tracked everything — automatically, assessing threat and finding none.

He stood. Stretched. Went to his room.

I sat. The kitchen. The table. The gouge. The tea — cold, because. The chrysanthemum I'd bought today, unused, sitting on the counter in a paper bag.

The word he hadn't said.

I heard it in the quiet. In the kitchen at night. In the gouge that was permanent.

I drank my tea. The cold version. The only version.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Event:Reflection ratio rebalanced (~24:76 → ~45:55) by cutting 3 major analytical cascades ("Not just you" triple reflection, "Good" cascade, "True. I was something" cascade) and adding physical beats
- Fixed [HIGH]: Added external events: kettle clicking/cooling, dog barking, wind bending candle, Wei's nervous physical choreography (kettle, leaning, arms)
- Applied Global Patterns: Cut "and the X was the Y and the Y was the Z" recursive chains throughout; preserved the "Not just you" emotional beat but delivered it in 1 paragraph instead of 3
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: Wei's physical restlessness (picking up kettle, crossing/uncrossing arms) shows his anxiety far better than Yun's analytical paragraphs told it.
