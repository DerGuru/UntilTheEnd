# Chapter 13

Evening.

The kitchen. The kitchen of a small house in a small settlement — clay walls, wooden table, two cups, a pot. The table had a gouge near the edge where Wei had dropped a blade during an indoor demonstration that I had not sanctioned and that he had conducted anyway. Their conducting was autonomy. Their autonomy was the gouge and the gouge was permanent.

He stood. I sat. The geometry of conversations that mattered — he stood because he couldn't sit still and I sat because I could and the contrast was us and us was the arrangement.

"There was someone at the market. From a sect. Iron Lotus."

I looked up. Not because I didn't know — I knew. I'd known since the herb stall, since the chrysanthemum, since the thirty minutes of conversation I'd pretended not to hear. I looked up because looking up was the performance of learning something and the performance was what he needed because he needed to be the one telling me and the telling was his agency and his agency was the thing I was protecting.

"He said my talent is—"

"Wasted?"

He blinked. The blink of someone whose prepared speech had been anticipated. Their anticipation by someone else was both flattering and annoying and the ratio of flattering to annoying was approximately 40/60 in favor of annoying because anticipation was also control and control was the thing he was outgrowing.

"—unusual."

"That's a different word."

"It's the word he used."

Silence. The silence of a conversation that was happening in two registers — the audible one, in which information was being exchanged, and the sub-audible one, in which something much larger was moving between us, tectonic, slow, the shift of plates that would eventually produce geography.

"They offer training. Real masters. Not just—"

He stopped.

The air in the room changed. The change that happened when a word was about to arrive and then didn't — the pressure of the unsaid, the shape of the absent, the acoustic imprint of a syllable that existed in his mouth and in my hearing and in the space between us and that he chose, at the last possible moment, not to release.

Not just you.

That was it. The sentence. The one he'd been building toward and that he'd dismantled at the threshold. Their dismantling was a kindness. Their kindness was also a confession because the dismantling said: I know what I almost said, and I know what it would mean, and I'm choosing not to say it, and the choosing is the evidence that I understand the weight.

Not just you.

Three words. One pronoun. The pronoun that was me — me, the acquaintance, the teacher, the whatever-I-was that had no title because titles were for relationships that had definitions and our relationship had exactly zero definitions and the zero was intentional and the intentional was mine and mine was a choice I was now paying for because choices had prices and prices came due and due was now.

"The what," I said. Flat. The flatness that was not calm but the absence of everything that was not calm, the vacated tone that happened when too many things wanted to occupy the same emotional space and the resolution was: none of them.

He looked at the table. The gouge.

"They offer training," he said. Quietly. "That's all I'm saying."

"Good."

One word. The word that meant: I've heard you, I've processed you, I've filed you, and the filing is the response and the response is minimal because minimal is what I can produce right now because the alternative to minimal is the other thing and the other thing is too much and too much is the territory I do not enter.

He looked at me. Fourteen. Brown eyes. The eyes that were reading me the way he read everything — quickly, accurately, with the instinct that came from years of proximity to someone whose emotions were expressed in micro-adjustments rather than statements.

"You're angry."

"No."

"You're something."

True. I was something. The something that existed in the space between angry and afraid and that had no name because naming it required the kind of self-knowledge that I had in abundance but that I chose not to apply to this, not yet, not in this kitchen with this boy and this gouge in the table and this sentence hanging in the air between us like a blade at the apex of its arc.

"I'm drinking tea," I said.

He almost smiled. The almost that said: I know you're deflecting, and I know why, and I'm going to let you, and the letting is my kindness and my kindness is the proof that I've learned from you and the learning includes how to leave things alone when things want to be left alone.

"Okay," he said.

"Okay."

He sat. Finally. The sitting of someone who had delivered the information. Their delivery was complete. Their completeness allowed him to rest. He poured himself tea. Drank. Looked at the table. Looked at me. Looked at the table.

"I'm not going," he said. "I'm just — I'm telling you."

"I know."

"You always know."

"Not always."

A pause. The pause that happened between us when the conversation had reached its actual content and the actual content was not the words but the silence between them and the silence was saying: we're still here, we're still this, whatever this is, it's still us.

He stood. Stretched. Went to his room.

I sat. The kitchen. The table. The gouge. The tea — cold, because. The chrysanthemum I'd bought today, unused, sitting on the counter in a paper bag.

The word he hadn't said.

Not just you.

I heard it. In the quiet. In the acoustic profile of a kitchen at night in a settlement where nothing happened and everything was about to happen and the about-to-happen was the word and the word was the pronoun and the pronoun was me and me was insufficient and insufficient was the truth and the truth was the gouge and the gouge was permanent.

I drank my tea. The cold version. The only version.
