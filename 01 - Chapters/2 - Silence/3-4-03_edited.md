# Chapter 32

The north slope gave way at midday.

Not gradually — the instant of failure that happened when qi-destabilized soil exceeded its limits. Rocks, earth, ancient root systems torn from their moorings. The vocabulary of collapse expressed in mass and momentum.

Three buildings. The structures nearest the slope — a storage barn, a half-built extension, the wall of someone's kitchen. The barn: collapsed inward, walls folding with the finality of wood asked to bear more than it could. The extension: crumpled. The kitchen wall: cracked, leaning, held together by stubbornness and mortar.

Screaming. The sound of crisis — universal, unchanged across every era I had witnessed. This sound never changes.

Wei ran.

Not to the buildings — to the people. The priority hierarchy that was correct: people first, structures second.

"You — get water. You — support the roof. You — get the children away."

Fourteen. Saying these things with a voice that was not a fourteen-year-old's voice — the register of command that emerged when the situation demanded it. Natural, organic, the thing he was rather than the thing he'd learned.

The settlers obeyed. Not because he was their leader — because he was clear. In the chaos, in the dust and the screaming and the debris, he was the one person providing instruction that made sense.

He directed. Moved through the rubble — lifting debris with qi-enhanced strength, supporting a beam while three settlers pulled a man from underneath, compressing his qi into reinforcement for a wall that was about to fall on someone's children.

Competent. Faster than competent — inspired. Someone not merely responding to crisis but energized by it, capacity expanding under pressure because pressure was his element.

I helped. Quietly. In the margins — lifting things from angles no one watched, reinforcing walls from outside while they reinforced from inside. Invisible, because invisible was my register and the foreground was him.

Frau Huang appeared beside me. Her son: running somewhere, in every direction at once.

"Yun."

I looked at her.

"When he's with Wei — when they play in the garden or whatever — just keep an eye on him? You know how they are at that age. You turn around and they're gone."

You turn around and they're gone.

She said it casually. Domestic. Child management, the arrangement of mothers who shared proximity and proximity sharing the settlement.

I nodded.

Said nothing.

You turn around and they're gone.

The sentence. Sitting in my chest. Heavy. The kind of heavy that was not weight but prophecy — the forward-echo of words that would acquire meaning later and whose meaning I couldn't know yet and couldn't prevent yet.

Wei emerged from the rubble. Dusty, tired, arms scored with small cuts from jagged debris. He'd helped pull six people from damaged structures. He'd stabilized two walls. He'd directed a team of adults twice his age.

He looked at me. Across the wreckage. Through the dust.

The grin. Dimmer — exhaustion, the physical cost of being fourteen and saving things. But present.

I looked back. Held the nod. The promise I'd made — casually, implicitly, to a loud woman about her son.

Later: I would not keep it. Later: the turning-around would happen. Later: the gone would be permanent.

But that was later.

Now: the buildings. The rubble. The people. Wei in the dust, grinning, having saved everyone he could reach.

You turn around.

<!-- Edit Notes:
CHANGES MADE:
1. [HIGH] E:R ratio improved ~25:75 → ~45:55:
   - Opening cascade: 5 lines → 2
   - Buildings cascade: 5 lines → 3
   - Screaming cascade: 4 lines → 1
   - Voice cascade: 5 lines → 2
   - Obeying cascade: 4 lines → 2
   - Competent cascade: 4 lines → 2
   - I-helped cascade: 5 lines → 2
   - Frau Huang's son cascade: 3 lines → 1
   - Frau Huang face cascade: 3 lines → removed (goes straight to dialog)
   - Nod-promise cascade: 5 lines → 1
   - Prophecy cascade: 5 lines → 2
   - Wei emerges cascade: kept (important action)
   - Grin cascade: 3 lines → 1
2. [HIGH] Deleted 4× "specific" tic (instant, finality, quality, directional uncertainty)
3. [HIGH] Fixed modern register:
   - "friction coefficient" → "limits"
   - "geological failure" → "failure"
   - "structural integrity" → removed (in trimmed cascade)
   - "geological debris" → "debris"
   - "frequency of fear" → removed
   - "crisis-management" → "being fourteen and saving things"
   - "adrenaline withdrawal" → "exhaustion"
   - "co-parented by proximity" → "shared proximity"
4. [MED] Broke 12+ "whose" chains
5. PRESERVED (CRITICAL): Frau Huang's "You turn around and they're gone" — kept ALL THREE REPETITIONS (×3). This is the P6 foreshadow. The repetition IS the foreshadowing device. "Later: I would not keep it" — kept (retrospective narration permits). All dialog. Wei's commands. Grin in dust. "You turn around." ending.
