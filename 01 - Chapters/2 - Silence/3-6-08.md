# Chapter 51

I knelt beside him.

The silence: total. The sky: grey. His eyes: open. The scar on his shoulder: white. The hands: torn. The core: dark.

I looked at his face. At the features that were fourteen and half-formed and belonging to no one now. At the arrangement of bone and skin and expression that I had watched change over years — from the child who argued with the pot to the boy who fought cultivators to the body that lay in dirt with the grey in his eyes.

And then —

*He never had a chance.*

The thought arrived from somewhere cold. Ancient. The groove worn by one hundred and forty-seven repetitions.

*He never had a chance.*

Cold. Absolute. Six words. Not a sentence — a stone. Falling through the layers of whatever I was feeling, through the silence, through the grey morning, through the body on the ground.

Not: he fought well. Not: he was brave. Not: if only I had. Not: why didn't I.

*He never had a chance.*

The sentence stood. Alone.

*He never had a chance.*

*With me — always.*

I stayed there. With the silence. With his open eyes and the grey sky in them and the cold fact of six words that were true. Their truth did not help. And nothing was the thing I knelt in.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: B4-Foreshadow — added "*With me — always.*" (English equivalent of "Bei mir — immer") as involuntary thought after the final echo. Foreshadows Book 4 pattern.
- Fixed [HIGH]: Post-echo over-explanation — cut ~300 words of analysis ("The thought arrived from somewhere that was not the place where thoughts lived...", "This was not sequential. This was impact...", "Fact. Not feeling. Not interpretation..."). "Der Satz steht. Allein." — The sentence stands. Alone.
- Applied Global Patterns: GP-06 (echo trimming), GP-03 (post-show cascades removed from echo reactions).
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The echo now repeats four times with almost no analysis between repetitions — each one hits harder because there's nothing to cushion it.
