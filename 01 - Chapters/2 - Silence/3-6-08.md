# Chapter 51

I knelt beside him.

The silence: total. The sky: grey. His eyes: open. The scar on his shoulder: white. The hands: torn. The core: dark.

I looked at his face. At the features that were fourteen and half-formed and belonging to no one now. At the arrangement of bone and skin and expression that I had watched change over years — from the child who argued with the pot to the boy who fought cultivators to the body that lay in dirt with the grey in his eyes.

And then —

*He never had a chance.*

The thought arrived from somewhere that was not the place where thoughts lived. Not from analysis, not from grief, not from the operational layer of consciousness that processed events and produced responses. From somewhere else. Somewhere cold. Ancient. The location in the architecture of a mind that had experienced this — exactly this — one hundred and forty-seven times. Their experiencing had worn a groove and the groove was the track and the track played automatically.

*He never had a chance.*

Cold. Absolute. Six words. Not a sentence — a stone. Falling. Through the layers of whatever I was feeling, through the silence, through the grey morning, through the body on the ground. Six words that weighed more than the analysis. Their weighing was the arrival and the arrival was: done.

Not: he fought well. Not: he was brave. Not: if only I had. Not: why didn't I.

*He never had a chance.*

The sentence sat.

In the silence. In the space. Alone. Without context or comfort or the frames that normal thoughts carried — the before and the after, the because and the therefore, the narrative that made thinking bearable by making it sequential.

This was not sequential. This was impact. A single point of force applied to a single point of consciousness and the application was: fact.

Fact. Not feeling. Not interpretation. The cold assessment of a pattern that had repeated enough times to become autonomous — the grief-before-grief, the knowing-before-knowing, the response that fired before the actual response because the actual response required time and time required being alive to time and alive to time was not what I was.

What I was: kneeling beside a dead boy in dirt. Looking at his face. While a sentence that I had not composed and did not choose echoed in the space where choice used to live.

*He never had a chance.*

I stayed there. With the sentence. With the silence. With his open eyes and the grey sky in them and the cold fact of six words that were true. Their truth was the kind of truth that did not help. Their not-helping was the point and the point was: nothing helps. And nothing was the thing I knelt in.
