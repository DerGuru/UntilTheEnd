# Chapter 23

Third round.

The lynx came low — a different approach, the adaptation of a predator that had learned from two exchanges that high attacks were met with evasion and redirection and that low was the angle this target hadn't defended. Animals learned fast when they were qi-enhanced. The intelligence wasn't human but it was sufficient. It was sufficient to be dangerous.

Wei adjusted. Too late. The adjustment happened but the happening was delayed by the fraction of a second that separated anticipation from reaction and the fraction was the gap and the gap was the claw.

It hit.

Paw across shoulder. Diagonal. Deep.

The sound: fabric tearing, then something wetter, the acoustic of skin separating under force that was not a sound anyone wanted to hear and that I heard from eight meters with the clarity of someone whose perception was designed for clinical detail. Their clinical detail was currently producing nausea.

Blood. Immediate. Red, hot, the vivid arterial color that said: this is real, this is deep, this is the difference between a torn sleeve and a torn body and the difference is blood and the blood is on his arm and his arm is attached to his shoulder and his shoulder is—

Wei screamed.

Short. One syllable. The vocalization of someone whose body had been breached. Their breach was the pain and the pain was a surprise because pain was always a surprise, even when you expected it, even when you'd trained for it, because the training was theoretical and the pain was not.

Then: silence. His jaw closed. Teeth together. The clench of someone choosing to stop screaming. Their choosing was the willpower and the willpower was his.

He didn't step back.

That was the thing. The thing that was the evidence and the evidence was the training and the training was mine and the mine was the proof: he didn't retreat. His left arm — the struck arm, the bleeding arm, the arm that was producing a warm red line from shoulder to elbow — hung. His right arm came up. Qi concentrated in the right palm. Bright. Brighter than before. The brightness of emergency, of adrenaline converted to qi-output, of a body that was hurt and responding to the hurt by pushing harder and the pushing being the instinct and the instinct being: fight.

The lynx recovered from its strike. Turned. Came again.

Wei met it.

Right palm forward. A qi-pulse — not the trained, modulated output of a form, but the raw, unfiltered discharge of a fourteen-year-old whose left shoulder was open. Their right hand was the only weapon. Their weapon was everything and everything was this pulse.

It hit the lynx. Square. Center mass.

The animal staggered. A real stagger this time — not the annoyance of the first exchange but the physical disruption of a qi-strike that had been powered by pain and adrenaline and the fuel that only desperation provided. Their provision was generous because desperation was abundant and abundance was what Wei was running on.

The lynx shook. Its qi-lines flickered — a visible disruption, the biological equivalent of a circuit breaker tripping. For a moment — two seconds, maybe three — the animal's enhancement wavered.

Wei pressed. Another strike. Same hand. Same arm. His qi output: sustained, brutal, the continuous channeling that was expensive and unsustainable and that he maintained anyway because maintaining it was the only option and options were the currency of combat and he was spending everything.

The lynx retreated. Two steps. Three. Its posture shifted — from predator to prey, the realignment that happened when a territorial animal encountered something it couldn't categorize and the something was a bleeding boy whose qi was too bright. Their brightness was the argument and the argument said: I am more than I appear.

I stood. Eight meters. My mouth: full of blood. My palms: crescent wounds from fingernails, four per hand, the bilateral evidence of symmetrical restraint. My feet: planted, rooted, the grounding of someone who was preventing herself from moving by making her body heavy and heaviness being the anchor and the anchor being the only thing between me and the lynx and the lynx being the thing I could destroy in a thought.

Wei looked at me.

One glance. From across the clearing. Through the blood and the sweat and the torn sleeve and the pain. His eyes met mine and in his eyes was the word and the word was: no.

Not spoken. Not shouted. Not even mouthed. Communicated in the frequency that existed between us — the channel that had been built by years of proximity and silence and the silence being the language and the language saying, now, clearly:

*I can do this.*

I stayed.

The cost of staying was the blood on my tongue and the crescents in my palms and the, architectural damage that restraint produced in a body that was built for action and that was acting by not-acting. Their not-acting was the hardest thing I had done in this body, in this lifetime, in the and bounded existence that currently contained me.

*Harder than fighting. Harder than running. Harder than any of it.*

The lynx steadied. Its qi-lines re-established. It hadn't retreated far enough for safety. It was still here. Still in the clearing. Still the fight.

Wei's left arm: dripping. The blood loss — not critical, not yet, but present, accumulating, the arithmetic of fluid leaving a body at a rate that had a timeline and the timeline had an endpoint and the endpoint was the thing I was monitoring with the part of my mind that wasn't occupied by restraint.

He breathed. Set his stance. Right arm up. Left arm: at his side, held close, the minimized profile of a limb that was damaged. Their damage was being compensated for by the other limbs and the compensation being the adjustment and the adjustment being: survive.

The lynx gathered.

Wei waited.
