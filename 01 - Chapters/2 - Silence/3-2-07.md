# Chapter 16

He left before sunrise.

Not sneaking — not Wei, not sneaking, he couldn't sneak if his survival depended on it and his survival had depended on it and he hadn't sneaked then either. He simply woke early and dressed and stood in the doorway and said:

"I'm going to look."

"I know."

"Just look."

"Yes."

He left. The sound of his footsteps — barefoot on stone, then dirt, then the path that led east, then gone. The progressive silence of departure, the acoustic evidence of distance accumulating between two points and the points being him and me and the accumulating being the morning.

I sat.

The waiting.

I am not good at waiting. I am good at action — at assessment, intervention, the kinetic vocabulary of someone whose function for millennia was to observe and respond. Their responding was the purpose and the purpose was the waiting's opposite. I am built for the sprint, not the vigil. For the correction, not the pause. For the doing, not the sitting.

And sitting is what I did.

The house: small, quiet, containing me and the absence of him and the absence being a negative space that had weight, that occupied volume, that pressed against the walls and the ceiling and the floor with the pressure of someone-who-was-here-and-is-not and the not-being-here-ness filling the space he'd vacated.

Tea.

I made tea. Properly — hot water, leaves, the process that required attention and that I used for exactly that purpose, as an attention-sink, a place to put the focusing that needed somewhere to go because its destination was empty and empty was the house and the house was where I was and where he wasn't.

Hot tea. I drank it hot. The novelty: startling. Temperature as presence — the warmth of the cup in my hands being the substitute for the warmth of the boy in the room and the substitution being inadequate and the inadequacy being the point because points were what I collected and collected was what I did with things I could not hold.

Hours.

I don't know how many. Time moved at the rate that waiting imposed — slow, viscous, the consistency of duration that had been stirred into thickness by anxiety. Their thickness was the medium I was moving through.

The items I did not do: train, repair, walk, cook, read, meditate, plan, catalog, sort.

The items I did: sit.

The teacup had a hairline crack. Running from the rim to the midpoint — not structural, not dangerous, the kind of flaw that reduced the cup's value without reducing its function. I held the crack. My thumb over the line where the ceramic had compromised. Their compromise was contained. Their containment was my thumb and my thumb was the intervention and the intervention was the metaphor and the metaphor was heavy.

I released the crack.

The cup held.

Afternoon. Sun moving from east windows to west windows. The geometry of light as chronometer — the angle telling me what I wouldn't measure by other means, which was: four hours, five hours, six.

The garden. I looked at it through the window. Three pots. The dock grass had produced a second stalk, vertical and determined. The lemongrass was being lemongrass. The nettle-cousin had bloomed — a small, white, incorrect flower that was beautiful because it was wrong and wrong because it was here.

The blade fragment. Catching afternoon light.

The stones.

His things. The collection of objects that said: I was here, I put these here, this is my place, and my place is the evidence and the evidence is the garden and the garden is mine.

I waited.

The quality of waiting when you cannot act and acting is your nature and your nature is being overridden by the principle and the principle is: this is his choice. The quality that lived in the chest, in the space between sternum and spine, the tightness that wasn't pain but the architecture of pain — the structure without the substance, the frame without the filling, the house without the inhabitant.

He would come back. He would come back because he always came back and always was the track record and the track record was the evidence and the evidence was reliable.

Or he wouldn't. He would stay. He would walk through the gate and see things that were shiny and people who were impressed and impressedness directed at him, at this boy with the hip correction and the extraordinary qi and the brightness, and the brightness would be reflected and the reflection would be irresistible and irresistible was the thing I was afraid of and afraid was the word and the word was the accurate one.

The crack in the cup. I hadn't put my thumb back. The cup held anyway.

Evening.

The light: low, golden, the honey-shade that preceded sunset and that was beautiful and that was also the color of endings and endings were the thing I was not thinking about.

Footsteps.

On the path. Approaching. The rhythm of feet on dirt that I recognized not because I recognized all footsteps but because I recognized his, the cadence of weight and pace and intention that was Wei and Wei was arriving and arriving was the verb and the verb was enough.

The door.

He stood in it. Dirty shoes — he'd worn shoes, which meant he'd been formal, which meant he'd taken the visit seriously, which meant the seriousness was real and the reality was the thing I would have to process later because now was the arriving and arriving was the priority.

His face: neutral. The neutrality that preceded speech, the flat canvas before the painting.

"I'm staying."

Two words. The two best words. The two words that contained everything — the visit, the decision, the choosing, the return. Two words that said: I went, I saw, I chose, and my choosing is this and this is here and here is where you are.

I said nothing. Nothing was the correct response. Nothing was the celebration that stayed internal, the exhale that didn't exhale, the relief that expressed itself as continued sitting and continued tea and the continuation being the evidence of normalcy and normalcy being the performance I owed him because performing relief would have been showing him the fear and showing him the fear would have been unfair and unfair was the territory.

"Why?" I asked. Later. After. When he'd sat, when he'd poured tea, when the arrival had settled into presence and presence was the default state.

He looked at me. The grin. The grin that was not the smile of politeness but the authentic expression of someone who had found something funny in the serious. Their finding was the humor and the humor was his register.

"Because they were boring."

I looked at him. He looked at me.

The crack in the cup. Still holding.

"Boring," I repeated.

"Boring."

The word that was deflection. The word that was not the real answer — the real answer being something larger, something he couldn't articulate or wouldn't articulate or didn't know how to articulate and the not-knowing being fourteen and fourteen being the age at which the important things were felt but not said and the not-saying was the pattern and the pattern was us.

Boring. Because they were boring. Because the Iron Lotus training grounds were impressive but not interesting and impressive and interesting were different things and different things were the space where his judgment lived and his judgment had decided: not this.

Or: because the people there didn't see him. Not the way the hip-correction saw him. They saw his qi, his potential, his metrics. They saw a resource. And he — fourteen, brown-eyed, someone who recognized the difference between being seen and being measured because he'd been measured before and measurement was not the same thing as seeing — had noticed.

Or: because he came back. Because back was here. Because here was me. And me was the thing he wasn't saying and the not-saying was the answer and the answer was the grin.

"Have some tea," I said.

He drank.

The cup held.
