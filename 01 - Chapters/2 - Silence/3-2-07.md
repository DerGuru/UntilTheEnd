# Chapter 16

He left before sunrise.

Not sneaking — not Wei, he couldn't sneak if his survival depended on it, and his survival had depended on it and he hadn't sneaked then either. He simply woke early and dressed and stood in the doorway and said:

"I'm going to look."

"I know."

"Just look."

"Yes."

He left. The sound of his footsteps — barefoot on stone, then dirt, then the path that led east, then gone.

I sat.

Tea. I made it properly — hot water, leaves, the process that required attention. An attention-sink. Somewhere to put the focusing that needed to go somewhere.

I drank it hot. The novelty: startling. Temperature as presence.

The teacup had a hairline crack. Running from the rim to the midpoint — not structural, the kind of flaw that reduced the cup's value without reducing its function. I held the crack. My thumb over the line where the ceramic had compromised.

I released the crack.

The cup held.

An hour passed. I washed the breakfast bowls — his and mine, though he hadn't eaten. I dried them. Stacked them. Wiped the counter twice. The second wipe was unnecessary. The second wipe was the point.

The garden. I went outside. Three pots. The dock grass had produced a second stalk, vertical and determined. The lemongrass was being lemongrass. The nettle-cousin had bloomed — a small, white, incorrect flower that was beautiful because it was wrong.

I pulled a weed from the base of the lemongrass. Then another. Then a third that wasn't a weed but that I pulled anyway because my hands needed occupation.

The blade fragment. Catching morning light now. The stones. His things. The collection of objects that said: I was here, this is my place.

A neighbor's goat wandered into the yard. Brown, unimpressed, chewing something it shouldn't have been chewing. I stared at it. It stared at me. Neither of us blinked. It ate another mouthful of Wei's dock grass and ambled away. I let it.

Midday. I repaired the hinge on the storage cabinet — the one that had been sticking since the rains. The screws were rusted. I cleaned them with oil, reset them, tested the swing. Smooth. Then I tightened the loose board on the front step. Then I checked the roof thatch above his room. Then I stood in his doorway and looked at the empty bedroll and the practice sword leaning against the wall and the three river stones he kept on the windowsill for no reason he'd ever explained.

The items I did not do: sit still.

"Come back," I said. To no one. To the house.

Afternoon. Sun moving from east windows to west windows. Four hours, five hours, six.

He would come back. He always came back. Or he wouldn't. He would walk through the gate and see things that were shiny and people who were impressed and impressedness directed at him, and the brightness would be reflected and the reflection would be irresistible.

The crack in the cup. I hadn't put my thumb back. The cup held anyway.

Evening.

The light: low, golden, the honey-shade that preceded sunset.

Footsteps.

On the path. Approaching. The cadence of weight and pace that was Wei. Arriving.

The door.

He stood in it. Dirty shoes — he'd worn shoes, which meant he'd been formal, which meant he'd taken the visit seriously.

His face: neutral. The flat canvas before the painting.

"I'm staying."

Two words. The two best words.

I said nothing. Nothing was the correct response — the celebration that stayed internal, the relief that expressed itself as continued sitting and continued tea.

"Why?" I asked. Later. After. When he'd sat, when he'd poured tea, when the arrival had settled into presence.

He looked at me. The grin — not the smile of politeness but the authentic expression of someone who had found something funny in the serious.

"Because they were boring."

I looked at him. He looked at me.

The crack in the cup. Still holding.

"Boring," I repeated.

"Boring." He drank his tea. "They had me stand in a line. For an hour. A line, Yun. Then someone measured my meridians with a stick." He wrinkled his nose. "A stick."

"Meridian assessment is standard practice."

"It's boring standard practice." He set the cup down. "And they kept calling me 'candidate.' Like I was a vegetable they were considering purchasing."

"You would be an expensive vegetable."

"I don't want to be any kind of vegetable."

He stretched. Leaned back. Looked at the ceiling the way he looked at ceilings — as though they might contain something interesting, which they never did.

"Also, their tea was worse than yours."

"My tea is average."

"Exactly."

The word that was deflection. Boring. Not the real answer — the real answer being something he couldn't articulate or wouldn't or didn't know how to. But: he came back. Back was here. Here was me. And me was the grin.

"Have some tea," I said.

He drank.

The cup held.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Event:Reflection ratio rebalanced (~25:75 → ~50:50) by replacing 6 paragraphs of waiting-analysis with concrete physical activities (washing bowls, fixing hinge, pulling weeds, goat encounter, repairing step, checking roof)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Added 5 new dialog lines expanding "boring" into a full comic exchange about meridian sticks, being called "candidate," and the vegetable comparison — total dialog exchanges now 7+
- Fixed [HIGH]: Added external events: goat encounter, house repairs, garden tending, Yun saying "Come back" to empty house
- Applied Global Patterns: Cut "I am not good at waiting" cascade, house-emptiness cascade, tea-as-substitute cascade, double "He would come back / Or he wouldn't" reflection; kept cup-crack motif as structural anchor
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: Expanding "boring" into a full scene with the meridian stick and "candidate" vegetable exchange transforms the chapter's emotional climax from told-relief into shown-humor-as-love.
