# Chapter 47

Western hill. Two hundred paces.

The signature expanded. Not gradually — fully. As if someone had been holding a door shut and then opened it and the door was not a door but a continent and the continent was qi and the qi was Immortal-stage and above.

My perception: whited out. Everything else — the combat at the east gate, the signatures, the barriers, the protection signs, Wei's core — gone. Replaced by the single overwhelming fact of a presence that existed on a scale I had not encountered in this century. Their scale was the kind that displaced everything smaller by virtue of existing.

I turned.

Not a decision. Reflex. The body's response to a stimulus that bypassed conscious thought and arrived directly at muscle, at bone, at the ancient survival architecture that said: face it. Whatever it is — face it.

Two hundred paces up the slope. Grey morning, grey trees, the undergrowth that climbed the western hill in layers of green and brown. And standing there — not hidden, not revealed, simply present in the way that beings of that magnitude were present: inevitably — a figure.

Robes. Simple. The kind of simplicity that only extreme power could afford because extreme power did not need decoration and the absence of decoration was the decoration. Hair: loose. Face: old. Not human-old — the other kind. The kind where age was a number that had stopped meaning what numbers meant and had started meaning something else.

The Hermit Master. From Book 2. The mountaintop. The encounter that had lasted minutes and contained centuries. Their containing was the exchange and the exchange was: two beings of impossible age acknowledging each other across an impossible divide.

He was here.

My feet moved. Two steps forward on the wall. Toward the western edge. My body orienting toward the signature the way a compass orients toward north — not by choice but by physics, by the fundamental alignment that qi-perception imposed on bodies that perceived. Their perception was: this is the largest thing in the room and the room is the world.

His qi reached me. Not aggressive — diagnostic. The frequency of one Immortal-tier being assessing another, the question asked in energy rather than language: *Are you in danger?*

He thought I was in danger. He had felt Wei's core-flare — the instability, the brightness, the signature that screamed emergency across the spectrum. And he had come. Because the last time he'd seen me, I was alone on a mountain, and now I was here, and here had a problem, and the problem was the brightness he'd felt from far away.

He was trying to protect me.

The irony. The, structural, load-bearing irony of a being who had traveled distance and crossed threshold to protect someone who did not need protection,. Their protection was the distraction,. Their distraction was—

His head tilted. Slight. To the left. Recognition — not of my face, which had not changed, but of my signature, which could not change, which was the fingerprint that millennia had established and that no disguise could alter at this level.

He raised his hand.

Two fingers. Extended. The salute.

The same gesture. Exactly the same — the angle, the height, the configuration of index and middle finger that he had used on the mountaintop in Book 2 when we stood on either side of a silence and the silence was the conversation and the conversation was complete.

Two fingers. Friendly. Unsettling. Knowing.

For a moment — one moment, compressed, total — I was not here.

I was on the mountaintop. Wind. Stone. The altitude where air became optional and breathing became choice. His robes in the wind. His eyes — the same eyes, the same depth, the same amusement at a universe that amused and terrified and bored in equal measure. The salute. The nod. The moment of mutual recognition that two beings of our kind shared when sharing was the only verb available at that altitude.

One moment. Maybe two.

My back was to the east gate. My back was to Wei.

The qi-assessment continued. His energy: probing, gentle, the touch of something enormous choosing to be careful. Not hostile. Never hostile. The goodwill of a being who had decided — long ago, on some mountain, in some century — that goodwill was the only interesting option. Their interest was his nature.

I answered. My qi met his — brief, confirmatory. *Not in danger. Not from them.*

He understood. Maybe. The tilt of his head: adjusting. The two-finger salute: lowering.

A breath. Two. Three.

The combat behind me — distant, muffled, the auditory displacement that occurred when perception was overwhelmed by proximity to Immortal-stage presence. I could hear it the way one hears rain through glass: real but separate, occurring in a dimension that was not the dimension I currently occupied.

Then—

My perception snapped.

Wei's core. Behind me. A flare — not the combat flares I'd been tracking, not the controlled bursts of fighting. This was different. This was the signature of a core under maximum stress discharging without governor, without limiter, without the structural integrity that maintained the difference between power and explosion.

I turned back.

The Hermit Master: still there. Still watching. His expression — unchanged, or changed in ways too subtle for the distance. His hand: down. The salute: complete.

I didn't look at him again. My body was already moving, already turning, already orienting back toward the east gate where the flare had come from and the flare was Wei and Wei was—

*Of course. Right now.*

The thought arrived cold. Without weight. The fact of timing that was not coincidence but causality — each piece leading to each piece, the Immortal+ arriving because Wei's core screamed, and the screaming pulling my attention, and the pulling creating the window, and the window being the twenty seconds, and the twenty seconds being enough.

Enough for what, I didn't know yet. But the knowing was coming. The knowing was already there, in the flare, in the signature, in the quality of Wei's core-light that had changed while my back was turned. Their changed quality was: less.
