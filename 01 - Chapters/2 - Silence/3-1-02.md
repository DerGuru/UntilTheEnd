# Chapter 2

Wei left without asking.

Not without telling — there was a distinction, and the distinction was the evolution, and the evolution was the thing I was tracking with the clinical attention of someone who understood that tracking was the substitute for controlling and that controlling was no longer available because the thing being controlled had developed opinions about the arrangement and the opinions were valid.

"I'm going out."

Not a question. A statement. The linguistic format of someone who had transitioned from requesting permission to announcing intentions, and the transition had happened not in a single moment but through a series of incremental adjustments — each one small enough to be unremarkable, collectively large enough to constitute a change of government.

"Where?"

"Out."

He was already at the door. Already hitting it with his hip. Already through. The morning took him — sunlight, dust, the particular energy of a fourteen-year-old boy encountering a day that hadn't been assigned a purpose and that was therefore available for exploration, and exploration was Wei's native mode the way sleeping was trees' native mode during winter: a default setting that required no instruction.

I stood in the doorway. Watched him go. Down the path, past the neighbor's fence, past the well where two women were discussing something that required gestures and volume, past the market where the morning's commerce was beginning its daily negotiation with the morning's reality, and into the territory beyond the settlement's edge — trees, hills, the landscape that surrounded us with the patient indifference of geography that existed before settlements and would exist after.

He didn't look back.

A year ago, he would have looked back. Six months ago, less often. Now — not at all. Not because he didn't care whether I was watching but because he was certain I was, and certainty eliminated the need for confirmation, and the elimination was trust in its most distilled form.

I drank my tea. It was cold. I drank it anyway, the way one drinks cold tea — with the commitment of someone who had started a beverage and intended to finish it regardless of the beverage's opinions about the delay.

He was gone for hours.

The hours were — interesting. In the way that absence was interesting, which was to say: not at all, unless you were the kind of being that noticed absence the way other beings noticed presence, that tracked the specific quality of a space that a person had vacated and that the person's vacating had changed, not physically but atmospherically, in the way that a room was different after someone left it and the difference was not measurable and was not imaginary and was the thing that I was sitting in, drinking cold tea, performing the ancient art of waiting.

I watered the garden. The dock grass was thriving. The nettle-cousin was producing something that might have been a bud or might have been a structural protest. The lemongrass was lemongrass, doing what lemongrass did, which was existing with the quiet reliability of a plant that understood its assignment.

I visited the Blade Whisperer. Not for conversation — for proximity. His workshop was open, the sound of stone on steel emerging in the rhythmic pattern that constituted his daily practice. He was sharpening a hoe. Treating it with the same reverence he applied to swords, because for Lao Chen, all metal was equal and all edges were worthy of attention and the attention was the respect and the respect was non-negotiable.

"The boy's not here," he said without looking up.

"I know."

"Good. He needs a day without supervision."

The sentence contained an observation, an assessment, and a gentle criticism, all compressed into six words delivered at the cadence of someone who understood that economy of language was a kindness and kindness was his secondary profession after metalwork.

I left. Walked back. Sat in the doorway.

Evening came with the reliability of a system that had been performing the same function for approximately four and a half billion years and that showed no signs of innovation. The sun descended. The shadows extended their territory. The settlement's daytime activities yielded to its evening activities with the smooth handoff of a process that had been optimized through repetition.

Wei returned.

His shoes were muddy. His face was sunburnt on one side — the side that had been facing south, the directional evidence of someone who had walked east in the morning and returned from the north and had therefore circumnavigated something or gotten lost and found his way back through the application of stubbornness rather than orientation.

He was grinning.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [CRITICAL]: Meta-leak "In Book One / In Book Two" → replaced with temporal references ("A year ago / Six months ago")
- Applied Global Patterns: Structural book-references converted to in-world time markers
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: Wei's growth now reads as lived experience rather than editorial commentary
