# Chapter 5

The market was Wei's territory now.

He'd claimed it the way he claimed things — not through declaration but through repetition. Going there. Coming back. Going again. The regularity of presence that established ownership without paperwork, the way rivers owned their banks and dogs owned their corners and Wei owned the third stall from the left where the dried-fruit vendor had discovered that the fourteen-year-old boy who appeared every three days was a superior negotiator and an inferior judge of quality and that the combination produced transactions that were entertaining and approximately fair.

He went alone. Brought back things. Some were correct — rice, oil, the specific variety of dried mushroom that worked in soup. Some were wrong — a spice that turned out to be decorative bark, a vegetable that the fungal kingdom had already submitted a claim on, a piece of fish that smelled like a philosophical argument about the relationship between freshness and hope.

But the wrongness was decreasing. Each trip produced fewer errors, the correction happening through experience rather than instruction, the learning curve that was steeper for being self-directed and more durable for being self-navigated.

He haggled. I knew this because Frau Huang told me — not directly, not in conversation, but through the medium of loudly discussing Wei's bargaining with another neighbor while standing close enough to my window that the discussion was either coincidental or a communication strategy.

"The boy got the rice vendor down by two coppers! TWO! That man hasn't budged on price since the drought and your boy — your boy just stood there and said 'that's fair for yesterday's rice' and the man looked at the rice and looked at the boy and—"

She laughed. The laugh of someone who found competence delightful and incompetence entertaining and whose emotional range between the two was wide enough to contain an entire community's worth of opinions.

"He'll be fine, that one," she said. Nominally to the neighbor. Actually to me.

I didn't answer. Answers would have required participation, and participation was available but not sought, and the not-seeking was not antisocial but architectural — the specific way I constructed my existence in a settlement that was not my settlement and among people who were not my people but who were Wei's and whose being-Wei's was sufficient.

Her son appeared. The Deaf Boy — my name for him, not because he was deaf but because he treated auditory input from his mother with the selectivity of someone who had developed a filter and whose filter was comprehensive and effective and optimized for the exclusion of specifically maternal frequencies.

He was twelve. Small. Energetic in the way that suggested his body had been given an energy budget designed for a larger frame and was spending the surplus on motion. He waited outside our house for Wei — sat on the step, drew patterns in the dirt, existed with the patient impermanence of a boy whose schedule was "until Wei comes back" and whose execution of the schedule was flawless.

"SHEN! NACH HAUSE!"

He didn't look up. The not-looking was practiced. Refined. The particular skill of someone who had determined that acknowledging an instruction was the first step toward complying with it and that not acknowledging was therefore a strategic defense and the defense was effective as long as volume was treated as a weather event rather than a communication.

"That boy," Frau Huang said, hands on hips, the posture of defeat disguised as management. "He hears when it's too late."

The sentence landed. Passed through me. Settled somewhere in the part of awareness that filed things under "said casually, will return later, will hurt then." I didn't flag it. Didn't process it. Didn't recognize it as the piece of foreshadowing that it was, because foreshadowing required an author and I was not an author and the world was not a text and the things people said were not planted by a consciousness with a plan.

Except.

I let the thought go. The letting-go was a practice, a discipline, the specific skill of not engaging with implications that led to territories I was avoiding, and the avoidance was effective and the effectiveness was a lie because effective avoidance was still avoidance and avoidance was not the same as resolution.

Wei returned. With the Deaf Boy. They went to the garden. Did things — moved pots, debated the identity of the nettle-cousin, argued about whether the blade fragment should be repositioned. The argument was conducted at the volume and intensity of two boys who found disagreement entertaining and agreement boring and whose entertainment was the friendship.

I sat in the doorway. Tea. The afternoon's assignment.

"Frau Huang wants to know if you need anything," Wei said at one point. Passing through the house. Getting water. The casual relay of domestic information that happened in settlements, the social infrastructure of neighbors checking on neighbors through the medium of their children.

"No."

"She says you never need anything."

"She's observant."

"She says you should come to dinner sometime."

"Tell her maybe."

"I told her maybe last time. She said 'maybe' is the polite way of saying 'no' and she wants an actual answer."

"Tell her maybe."

He grinned. The grin of someone who understood that the exchange was a routine and that routines were a form of affection and that affection between adults was conducted through the repetition of inadequate responses and the tolerance of the repetition and the tolerance was the relationship.

He went back outside. To the Deaf Boy. To the garden. To the wrong plants and the right stones and the fragment of metal and the afternoon that was happening in a settlement where we had a house with a door that stuck and neighbors who asked questions and a boy who went to the market and came back and whose coming back was still the part that mattered and whose mattering hadn't diminished yet and whose yet was the word I was watching and the word I was afraid of and the word that lived in every comfortable moment like a seed in soil, waiting.

The sun went down. The Deaf Boy went home — called, finally, by a volume that exceeded even his filter's capacity. Wei waved. The Deaf Boy didn't wave back, which was either rudeness or the twelve-year-old equivalent of emotional reserve and the distinction was irrelevant because they'd see each other tomorrow and tomorrow was a certainty and certainty was the foundation of their friendship and their friendship was healthy and normal and the kind of thing that happened when boys lived near each other and shared dirt and arguments and time.

I drank my tea.

Cold, as always.

As always.
