# Chapter 5

"Then learn it as a tool," Xu Ran said. "Then put it down."

We were walking again. The trail — higher, thinner, the rock more exposed and the vegetation more suggestion than fact. The morning was cold and clear, the clouds from yesterday's accumulation having discharged their rain overnight and left the sky scrubbed clean, the specific emptiness that follows weather.

I stopped.

"What?"

He adjusted his pack. The motion — familiar, habitual, the minor recalibration that a man performs a hundred times a day when carrying weight over uneven terrain. He was not looking at me. He was looking at the trail, at the next section of path, at the tactical landscape of where-to-place-feet. But his voice was aimed at me with the precision of a thrown stone.

"You're trying to force a door that opens inward," he said. "Every time you push, it closes harder. So stop pushing."

"And do what?"

"Learn the mechanism first. You can warp reality — you've proven that. Bent trees, cracked stones, grass that grows toward you. But it's uncontrolled. It fires defensively. What if you CONTROLLED it?"

"I've controlled it. In B6. The sect —"

"That was reactive. That was: I need them gone, they're gone. What I mean is SYSTEMATIC control. Deliberate, practiced, the way a craftsman learns — not a miracle-worker but a craftsman. Small things. Then bigger things. Then — " he paused. The pause was loaded, the kind of pause that contained the conclusion he wanted me to reach on my own.

"Then myself."

"Then yourself."

I considered. The trail climbed. The fox-spirit was ahead, as always, the amber shape navigating terrain with an efficiency that made our bipedal efforts look grotesque.

"Since when are you clever?" I said.

"Since you stopped listening."

The delivery — the flat, uninflected, perfect delivery of a line that was simultaneously funny and knife-sharp and true. His face did not change. His stride did not change. He threw the line over his shoulder the way he threw everything that mattered and kept walking.

I almost smiled.

The logic was — logical. The frustration of the last two days — the pushing, the cracking stones, the autonomous qi-defense — had been the frustration of someone trying to demolish a building by running into it headfirst. Xu Ran was suggesting I learn architecture first. Understand the building. Map its structure. Identify the load-bearing walls. And then, with the specific knowledge of someone who understands what they're dismantling, take it apart piece by piece.

Not brute force. Craftsmanship.

"How?" I asked.

"Start small. You bent a tree without meaning to. Bend one on purpose. Understand how it works from the inside — not what happens, but what YOU do when it happens. Where the conviction sits. What it feels like. How the qi responds. Map yourself."

He was right. The recognition was annoying in the specific way that someone else's rightness always is — the moment where your own intelligence feels inadequate and another person's feels presumptuous and the fact of their correctness makes both feelings irrelevant.

"You've been thinking about this," I said.

"I've been thinking about you," he said. And then, before the sentence could acquire weight: "In a clinical sense. Observational."

"Of course."

"I'm a scholar."

"Of course."

We walked. The clouds — high, thin, reformed from the dissolved remnants of yesterday's cover — drifted with the specific purposelessness that I was beginning to envy. Form without grip. Shape without will. The clouds didn't decide to be clouds. They were clouds because the conditions produced clouds, and when the conditions changed, they were something else.

The plan. Xu Ran's plan. It was — a plan. Not a revelation, not a shortcut, not the dramatic narrative event that resolved problems through a single moment of clarity. A plan. The most mundane, least dramatic, most practical thing in the world.

Step one: control the warping.
Step two: understand the mechanism.
Step three: apply it inward.

The steps were clear and the path between them was unclear and the unclear path was the territory of Book Seven and I was standing at the beginning of it with a fox and a scholar and the last rice crumbs in a bag.

"We need to find a place," I said. "Somewhere stable. Where I can practice without destroying the landscape."

Xu Ran nodded. "Somewhere with replacement trees."

Almost a joke. Almost. The line where his humor lived — the narrow band between earnestness and irony — was the line I had learned to navigate since B4. He meant it and didn't mean it. The trees had bent and the stones had cracked and the prospect of sustained practice in a populated area was genuinely dangerous.

"Higher," I said. "Where there's less to break."

"Higher," he agreed.

We climbed. The fox-spirit led. The plan sat between us — small, practical, unromantic, the kind of plan that didn't require heroes or miracles, just time and patience and the willingness to learn something by doing it badly first.

It was enough.
