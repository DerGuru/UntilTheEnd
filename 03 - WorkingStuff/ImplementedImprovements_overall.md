# Implemented Improvements — Overall (Books 1–4)

## Summary
Applied targeted edits from `Improvements_overall.md` across Books 1–2, focusing on all [CRITICAL] items and many [HIGH]/[MED] items. Edits follow the edit-only constraint: ≥60% original sentences preserved per chapter, no new major plot events, no scene reordering.
