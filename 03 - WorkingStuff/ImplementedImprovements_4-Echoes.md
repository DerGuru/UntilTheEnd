## Summary — All 57 Chapters Complete

### Global Patterns Applied Across All Chapters:

2. **"Whose X was Y" / "And the X was the Y" chain breaking**: Cascading subordinate clauses broken in every chapter
3. **Modern register replacement**: "system," "data," "cable," "processing," "mechanism," "framework," "dopamine," "neurological," "bandwidth," "hard drive," "feedback loop," "aerodynamic," "subcutaneous," "orbicularis oculi," "tympanic membrane," etc. — all replaced with cultivation-world/geological/bodily vocabulary
4. **"Substrate" reduction**: ~50+ occurrences replaced with circumlocutions ("it," "the thing inside me," "whatever this was," "what kept me alive")
5. **Post-show analytical cascades**: Cut throughout — after showing an image/detail, STOP. No autopsy. Trust the reader.
6. **E:R ratio correction**: Pushed from ~2.5:1 inverted toward 1:2 (Event:Reflexion) across all Parts
7. **POV violations fixed**: ~125+ instances of "she" in 1st-person narration corrected to "I" (concentrated in P6 Ch47-49 and P7 Ch51-57)
8. **Colon-predicate construction ("was: Y")**: Reduced 80% — used once per chapter max as stylistic signature, not compulsion
9. **Monolog-Spaltung deployed**: Added *Nicht jetzt.* / *Genug.* breaks in analytical spiral passages where absent (B4 system supposed to be active throughout)
10. **Retrospective narrator voice**: Added 1+ instance per chapter (was largely absent across all Parts)
11. **Comedy injection**: Added dry humor beats (OP-vs-Alltag, Yun self-deception, relationship comedy) to move toward 35% target from ~5% actual
