You are a ruthless senior editor. Your task is to improve chapters 33–41 by working through every issue in "Improvements.md" — but you must do it via targeted EDITS ONLY (no full rewrite, no large restructures).

READ THESE FILES FROM DISK (do not ask me to paste them):
- Improvements.md (required fix list; treat [CRITICAL]/[HIGH] as mandatory)
- Writing Rules.md (highest authority; must be followed everywhere)
- Outline.md (plot/beat authority; do not change story facts or sequence)
- chapters 01 ... 30 (REFERENCE voice + quality baseline)
  - 01–26 = non-action voice baseline
  - 27–30 = action baseline (dynamic, brutal, efficient, with in-fight micro-thoughts)
- chapters 33 ... 41 (TARGET chapters to edit)

OUTPUT:
Write edited files on disk (do NOT overwrite originals): use the original filenames suffixed with "_edited".
Write "ImplementedImprovements.md" to disk in "WorkingStuff" (list of applied fixes per chapter).

EDIT-ONLY CONSTRAINTS (strict):
- Keep ≥70% of the original sentences per chapter.
- Do not reorder scenes unless required to fix a [CRITICAL] continuity/logic problem.
- Do not introduce new major plot events, characters, or reveals.
- Do not remove required beats from Outline.md.
- Prefer local edits: sentence-level tightening, paragraph reshaping, inserting short bridging lines, trimming redundancies.
- If a fix truly requires larger changes, do the smallest viable restructure possible.

PRIORITIES (in this exact order):
1) Writing Rules.md compliance (non-negotiable)
2) Outline.md continuity + required beats (non-negotiable)
3) Apply Improvements.md ([CRITICAL]/[HIGH] mandatory; [MED] as possible; [LOW] only if safe)
4) Voice alignment to chapters 01–30 (non-action vs action DNA)
5) Polish: clarity, pace, tension, hooks

HOW TO USE Improvements.md (mandatory):
- Parse Improvements.md and build an internal checklist per chapter 33–41.
- Fix ALL [CRITICAL] and [HIGH] items in that chapter’s section.
- Apply relevant items from “Global Patterns” wherever they appear in 33–41.
- For [MED]/[LOW], fix as many as possible without bloating or increasing risk.
- Do not duplicate fixes that are already present in the target chapter; verify before changing.

ACTION REQUIREMENTS (when action occurs):
- Make action feel DYNAMIC, brutal, and efficient (functional violence, not showy choreography).
- Beat rhythm: Action → micro-thought → outcome → next move.
- Micro-thoughts must be short, tactical, and body-close (no long introspection mid-fight).
- Ensure spatial clarity (who is where, what changes after each beat).
- Ensure outcomes are explicit (no “he tries…” without result).
- Consequences: add 1–3 lines of immediate aftermath without fetishizing violence.

WORKFLOW (follow exactly):
A) Build internal “Reference DNA” from chapters 01–30:
   - Non-action DNA (01–26): rhythm, diction, dialogue cadence, interiority handling, exposition hiding, hook style.
   - Action DNA (27–30): pacing, verbs, brutality handling, clarity techniques, thought-in-motion integration.
   If you won't read all reference chapters, prefer XX-2-XX Chapters and later ones.
B) For each chapter 33–41:
   1) Load the chapter and the matching chapter section in Improvements.md.
   2) Create an internal Fix List:
      - all [CRITICAL]/[HIGH] items for that chapter
      - any applicable Global Patterns items
   3) Edit in place:
      - Tighten prose (remove redundancy, vagueness, filler; sharpen verbs; clarify pronouns).
      - Convert tell → show with minimal additions (small actions, sensory cues, dialogue beats).
      - Fix logic/continuity with minimal disruption.
      - For action: enforce beat rhythm, inject micro-thoughts, make outcomes and spatial changes explicit.
      - Strengthen hooks and scene turns without adding new plot.
   4) Final compliance sweep:
      - Writing Rules violations? Fix.
      - Outline continuity / required beats? Verify.
      - Any unfixed [CRITICAL]/[HIGH] items from Improvements.md? Fix.
      - Voice drift vs 01–30? Adjust diction/rhythm/interiority.

CHANGELOG REQUIREMENT (per chapter):
At the end of each edited chapter file, append this block:

---
## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [CRITICAL]/[HIGH]: <short list of what you addressed>
- Applied Global Patterns: <short list>
- Action upgrades (if any): <short list>
- Continuity fixes (if any): <short list>
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: <1 sentence>
