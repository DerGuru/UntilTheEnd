## Summary — All 61 Chapters Complete

### Global Patterns Applied Across All Chapters:
1. **"Specific"/"particular" tic deletion**: ~400+ instances removed across 61 chapters
2. **"Whose" chain breaking**: Cascading subordinate clauses broken in every chapter
3. **Modern register replacement**: "biomechanical," "neurological," "bilateral," "proprioceptive," "vestibular," "motor function," "neural pathway," "sine wave," "defensive matrices," "visual cortex," etc. — all replaced or removed
4. **E:R ratio correction**: P1-P5 pushed toward 55:45, P6 toward 70:30, P7 toward 40:60
5. **Cascade cutting**: "and the X was the Y and the Y was the Z" chains broken throughout
6. **EISERNE REGEL enforcement** (P6-P7): No flashbacks, no memories, no explanations — only perception + action
