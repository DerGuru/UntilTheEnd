# Edit Progress — Band 4 "Arrival"

## Production Reference Fixes (B1–B7 → in-world)
**CRITICAL:** 85+ occurrences of "B1"–"B7" throughout chapters, referring to book numbers. Must be replaced with in-world event/time references.

### Replacement Key:
- B1 → "the beginning" / "long ago"
- B2 → "early on" / "the town"
- B3 → "Wei" / "since Wei" / "the grief" / "the silence"
- B4 → "months ago" / "the wandering" / "the echoes" / "for months"
- B5 → "the field" / "the breach" / "the crack" / "the collapse" / "'I'm cold'"
- B6 → "the twist" / "the river" / "the mirrors" / "the sash"
- B7 → "now" / (context-dependent)

- [ ] 7-1-06: line 43 "B3"/"B5"

- [ ] 7-2-05: line 13 "since B6"
- [ ] 7-2-06: line 55 "B6 had been mirrors"
- [ ] 7-2-07: line 39 "the 'unfair' of B6"
- [ ] 7-2-09: line 31 "since B6 Part 7"

### KEY REPLACEMENTS USED:
| Production Term | In-World Replacement |
|---|---|
| B5's parting gift | the crack's parting gift / a parting gift from the crack |
| since B5 | since the breach / since the crack / since the field |
| B5's field | the field |
| B5's collapse | the collapse / the field's dissolution |
| B5's wall-system | the wall |
| from B5 | from memory |
| B5 had taught him | The field had taught him |
| In B5, pushing had worked | Before the crack, pushing had worked |
| since B4 | for months / for a long time |
| B4's Gedanken-Echos | the Gedanken-Echos / the echoes |
| since B4 and B5 | through the echoes and the field |
| B6's fundamental lesson | The fundamental lesson |
| His B6 function | His function here |
| B6's warping | the warping |
| B6's opening | for weeks now |
| since B1 | since the beginning |
| in B3 | after Wei |
| since B3 | since Wei |
| in B1 | long ago |
| before B6 | before the twist |
| I was immune... editing was mine | flickering half-formed sense (GP-02 downgrade) |
| A closed system | A closed circle (Rule 41) |

## GP-02 Premature Reveal Fix:
- [x] 6-1-04: "I was immune to the editing because the editing was mine" → downgraded to flickering half-formed sense

## Rule 41 "system" fixes:
- [x] 6-1-05: "A closed system" → "A closed circle"
- [ ] 7-5-05 line 23: "Not the system." — CLEAR violation
- [ ] Other "system" mentions mostly biological (immune/nervous/digestive) — OK

## HIGH Improvements (from Improvements_4-Arrival.md):
Not yet started — need to do after prod-ref sweep.

## 7-1-05 EXACT LINES TO FIX (already read):
- [x] ALL DONE

## 7-1-06, 7-1-07, 7-1-08:
- [x] ALL DONE

## 7-2-xx LINES TO FIX (EXACT TEXT from grep — NOT YET FIXED):
- 7-2-01 line 9: "Not stone. The correction was deliberate — the avoidance of the test that B6 had already performed" → FIX: "the test she had already performed"
- 7-2-01 line 23: "Not will. Something else. Something I'd learned in B6, at the river, with the sash and the open hands." → FIX: "Something I'd learned at the river, with the sash and the open hands."
- 7-2-04 line 5: "that equation had been B3's territory" → FIX: "that equation had belonged to the grief-years"
- 7-2-04 line 39: "In B3, the grief had been a blade — narrow, sharp, cutting. In B4, a weight — heavy, broad, pressing. In B5, an absence — the specific geometry of a space where something had been and wasn't. Now, in B7: the grief was a warmth." → FIX: "After Wei, the grief... Then later, a weight... Then at the field, an absence... Now the grief was a warmth."
- 7-2-05 line 13: "The three-step distance had closed permanently since B6's last part" → FIX: "since the ridge"
- 7-2-06 line 55: "But B6 had been mirrors — the book of mirrors, the book where every reflective surface" → FIX: "But these last months had been mirrors — the season of mirrors, the time when every reflective surface"
- 7-2-07 line 39: "Not the 'unfair' of B6 — not the emotional response to inequity" → FIX: "Not the 'unfair' of the twist"
- 7-2-09 line 31: "The woman who had not cooked since B6 Part 7" → FIX: "since the ridge"

## ADDITIONAL B-REFS TO CHECK (may exist in 7-3 through 7-7):
Run: grep_search for \bB[3-7]\b in 01 - Chapters/4 - Arrival/** to verify no more remain after 7-2-xx fixes

## AFTER PROD-REF SWEEP — REMAINING TASKS:
1. Fix Rule-41 "system" violations:
   - 7-5-05 line 23: "Not the system." → "Not the hold." or "Not the thing itself."
   - 6-6-05: "the automatic competence of a system that didn't know" → "a body that didn't know" (also Rule 41)
   - 6-6-02 line 19: "the two-voice system, the internal dialogue" → "the two-voice split, the internal dialogue"
2. HIGH improvements from Improvements_4-Arrival.md (chapters listed above)
3. MED improvements
4. Write ImplementedImprovements_4-Arrival.md to 03 - WorkingStuff/

## GLOBAL PATTERNS FROM IMPROVEMENTS FILE:
- GP-01: "system" in-world → replace with euphemisms (Rule 41)
- GP-02: Premature reveal before 6-4-04 midpoint → symptoms only, no causal certainty
- GP-03: Unsourced certainty → hedge with "seemed"/"felt like"/"as if"
- GP-04: Analytical overload / Essay drift → max 1 analytical sentence per paragraph
- GP-05: Repetition loops → only with escalation value
- GP-06: Dialogue-anchor deficit → external interruption every 1-2 paragraphs
- GP-07: Action/consequence gap → witness + material damage + social consequence
- GP-08: POV transition fragility (B7 P4→P5) → clean break
- GP-09: Supporting cast underuse → mini-arcs for village characters
- GP-10: Hook/payoff traceability → setup/payoff matrix

B6: 6-1-03(GP-02/03), 6-1-04(GP-02/03), 6-1-05(GP-01), 6-2-06(GP-02/03), 6-3-02(GP-01), 6-3-03(GP-02/03), 6-3-04(GP-03), 6-3-07(GP-03), 6-5-03(GP-01), 6-6-02(GP-01), 6-6-04(GP-01), 6-7-02(GP-01/03), 6-7-06(GP-03)
