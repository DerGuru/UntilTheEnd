## 3. HIGH GP-02/GP-03 Certainty Fixes — ALL COMPLETE ✅

### Pre-Midpoint (before 6-4-04):
- [x] 6-1-04: Premature reveal → flickering half-formed sense
- [x] 6-2-06: 4 fixes (trail-belief, process, creation-memory, architecture?)
- [x] 6-3-03: 3 fixes (fire-belief, fluctuating?, "What if my belief")
- [x] 6-3-04: 5 fixes (whatever-it-was, seemed-to-shape, seemed-like-always, could-not, machinery)
- [x] 6-3-07: "I knew" → "I was beginning to know"

### Post-Midpoint:
- [x] 7-3-06: "had propagated" → "must have propagated"
- [x] 7-3-02: "autonomic nervous system" → "involuntary reflex"

---

## 4. MED GP-03 Certainty Fixes — COMPLETE ✅

Pre-midpoint softening:
- [x] 6-1-02: "Absolutely certain" → "What looked like absolute certainty"
- [x] 6-1-07: "I knew. The calm knew." → "I felt it. The calm felt it."
- [x] 6-2-03: "the believing was all I had done" → added "as far as I could tell"
- [x] 6-3-02: "My beliefs shaped reality. All of it." → "Like my beliefs shaped reality... might be"

Post-midpoint items assessed — most already self-hedging or appropriately sourced. No changes needed.

## 5. MED GP-04/GP-05 — ASSESSED, DEFERRED ⬜

### GP-04: "the specific X of Y" Pattern
Quantified across all 114 chapters. Ranges from 4–22 instances per chapter.
Worst offenders (15+): 7-6-03(22), 7-7-11(22), 7-7-07(21), 7-6-04(21),
7-7-06(20), 7-4-05(20), 7-3-05(19), 7-7-02(18), 7-7-09(18), 7-3-08(17),
7-7-05(17), 7-7-08(16), 7-5-06(16), plus ~20 more at 14-15.

**Recommendation:** Dedicated "specific" reduction pass — trim 30-50% per chapter,
replace with varied constructions. Estimated ~200 individual replacements.

### GP-05: Repetitive Reiteration
Flagged in: 6-1-02, 6-1-03, 6-1-04, 6-3-04, 6-6-06.
Requires close-reading each chapter to identify and condense repetitive restatements.
