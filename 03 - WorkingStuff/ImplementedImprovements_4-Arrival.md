## 3. GP-02 Pre-Midpoint Reveal Fixes

Midpoint is at 6-4-04. All chapters before that must NOT state the belief→reality mechanism as confirmed fact.

### 6-1-04: Premature reveal downgraded
- "I was immune to the editing because the editing was mine" → flickering half-formed sense (uncertain proto-insight)

### 6-2-06: Belief-reality mapping softened (4 fixes)
- "belief preceded reality and reality conformed" → "or the thought arrived like that, unbidden and strange"
- "by a process I'd never known I was running" → "by what felt like a process"
- "With belief. With the same mechanism" → "With something that felt like belief. With what seemed like the same force"
- "My architecture. My conviction." (declarative) → "My architecture? My conviction?" (questions)

### 6-3-03: Causal chain softened (3 fixes)
- "belief had produced fire, and the fire had always been burning" → "the thought came, quiet and terrible: that the belief had produced the fire"
- "was my belief fluctuating" → "could that be my belief fluctuating?"
- "My belief shapes reality." → "What if my belief shapes reality."

## 4. GP-03 Unsourced Certainty Fixes

### 6-3-04: Wei death mechanism — 5 fixes
- "The same mechanism. The mechanism that moved stones" → "Whatever it was — the thing that had moved stones"
- "shaped reality with the effortless authority" → "seemed to shape the world"
- "It always won." → "It seemed like it always won."
- "you cannot override bedrock" → "it seemed — you could not override bedrock"
- "the belief-engine, the conviction-generator" → "whatever it was, the thing I'd been calling belief"

### 6-3-07: Pre-midpoint certainty softened
- "I knew this now — knew it the way I knew belief shaped reality" → "I was beginning to know this — to feel it the way I was beginning to suspect belief shaped reality"

### 7-3-06: Silence radius claim marked as inference
- "it had propagated outward as silence" → "it must have propagated outward as silence"

## 5. Verification
- Final grep for `\bB[1-7]\b`: **0 matches** ✅
- Final grep for `\bBook [1-7]\b`: **0 matches** ✅

## Not Addressed (MED/LOW items for future pass)
- MED GP-03: ~19 chapters with unsourced certainty at MED level (mostly post-midpoint, lower risk)
- MED GP-04: Meta-analysis voice drift in ~15 chapters
- MED GP-05: Repetitive explanation blocks in ~10 chapters
- LOW items: Prose tightening, sensory anchors, dialogue expansion
- Cross-chapter: Rice competence arc, notebook echo, child-counter arc, mirror/water motif staffing
