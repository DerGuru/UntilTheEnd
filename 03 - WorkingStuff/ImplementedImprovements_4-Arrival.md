## 3. GP-02 Pre-Midpoint Reveal Fixes

Midpoint is at 6-4-04. All chapters before that must NOT state the belief→reality mechanism as confirmed fact.

### 6-1-04: Premature reveal downgraded
- "I was immune to the editing because the editing was mine" → flickering half-formed sense (uncertain proto-insight)

### 6-2-06: Belief-reality mapping softened (4 fixes)
- "belief preceded reality and reality conformed" → "or the thought arrived like that, unbidden and strange"
- "by a process I'd never known I was running" → "by what felt like a process"
- "With belief. With the same mechanism" → "With something that felt like belief. With what seemed like the same force"
- "My architecture. My conviction." (declarative) → "My architecture? My conviction?" (questions)

### 6-3-03: Causal chain softened (3 fixes)
- "belief had produced fire, and the fire had always been burning" → "the thought came, quiet and terrible: that the belief had produced the fire"
- "was my belief fluctuating" → "could that be my belief fluctuating?"
- "My belief shapes reality." → "What if my belief shapes reality."

---

## 4. GP-03 Unsourced Certainty Fixes

### 6-3-04: Wei death mechanism — 5 fixes
- "The same mechanism. The mechanism that moved stones" → "Whatever it was — the thing that had moved stones"
- "shaped reality with the effortless authority" → "seemed to shape the world"
- "It always won." → "It seemed like it always won."
- "you cannot override bedrock" → "it seemed — you could not override bedrock"
- "the belief-engine, the conviction-generator" → "whatever it was, the thing I'd been calling belief"

### 6-3-07: Pre-midpoint certainty softened
- "I knew this now — knew it the way I knew belief shaped reality" → "I was beginning to know this — to feel it the way I was beginning to suspect belief shaped reality"

### 7-3-06: Silence radius claim marked as inference
- "it had propagated outward as silence" → "it must have propagated outward as silence"

| 6-6-03 | "each book's worth of experience" | "each era's worth of experience" |
| 6-4-03 | "of every book, every experience" | "of every age, every experience" |
| 6-4-03 | "The healings in the first book" | "The early healings" |
| 6-4-03 | "The coincidences in the second" | "The coincidences that followed" |
| 6-7-06 | "seven-books-of-accumulated-meaning" | "millennia-of-accumulated-meaning" |
| 6-6-04 | "across multiple books" | "for years" |

### "Book Six/Seven" structural labels:
| Chapter | Original | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| 6-7-07 | "The last image of Book Six" | "The last image" |
| 6-7-07 | "Book Seven was the path." | "What came next was the path." |
| 6-7-06 | "the shape of Book Seven" | "the shape of what remained" |

| 6-6-09 | "until the last book" | "until the end" |

### Intentional meta-awareness references KEPT:
- 6-4-04 line 55: "book after book, part after part, chapter after chapter" (midpoint revelation)
- 7-1-07 line 59: "a book I was inside of without knowing its title" (sensing narrative frame)
- 7-7-01 line 53: "first sentence of the first chapter of the first book" (finale)
- 7-7-02 line 55: "The way a book is complete" (simile)
- 7-7-10 line 45: "first sentence of the first book" (finale)

## 7. MED GP-03 Certainty Fixes (Session 2)

| Chapter | Original | Replacement | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6-1-02 | "Absolutely certain about what was being made" | "What looked like absolute certainty about what was being made" | Vision-MC certainty → observation distance |
| 6-1-07 | "I didn't think. I knew. The calm knew. The images knew... all of it knew. This was convergence." | "I didn't think. I felt it. The calm felt it. The images pressed toward it... all of it pointed the same direction. This felt like convergence." | Epistemic claim → phenomenological (pre-midpoint) |
| 6-2-03 | "the believing was all I had done" | "the believing was — as far as I could tell — all I had done" | Certainty hedge for pre-midpoint observation |
| 6-3-02 | "It was everything. My beliefs shaped reality. All of it. Always... all of it was operative. All of it was shaping. All of it had been shaping" | "It was starting to look like everything. Like my beliefs shaped reality... all of it might be operative. All of it might be shaping. All of it might have been shaping" | Most critical pre-midpoint fix — declarative fact → emerging hypothesis |

## Not Addressed (for future pass)
- MED GP-04: "the specific X of Y" pattern — 4-22 instances per chapter, pervasive stylistic tic
  - Worst chapters: 7-6-03(22), 7-7-11(22), 7-7-07(21), 7-6-04(21), 7-7-06(20), 7-4-05(20)
  - Estimated ~200 individual replacements needed
- MED GP-05: Repetitive explanation blocks in ~5 chapters
- MED GP-03: ~15 post-midpoint chapters with unsourced certainty — assessed, most already self-hedging
- LOW items: Prose tightening, sensory anchors, dialogue expansion
- Cross-chapter: Rice competence arc, notebook echo, child-counter arc, mirror/water motif staffing
