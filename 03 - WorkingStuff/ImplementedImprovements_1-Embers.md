- Fixed [MED]: Roughened Wei’s village-square delivery with a few childlike breaks (without changing the plan logic).

## Chapter 53 (`1-6-11.md` → `1-6-11_edited.md`)
- Fixed [MED]: Replaced “Nobody noticed” convenience with a small, realistic social consequence (glances/quiet space made), keeping Yun peripheral.

## Chapter 65 (`1-7-11.md` → `1-7-11_edited.md`)

## Chapter 26 (`1-4-02.md` → `1-4-02_edited.md`)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Reduced the meta-seam description so it reads as a sensory stutter (less explained, more uncanny).

## Notes
- Originals remain unchanged. All edits are written to new files with the `_edited` suffix.
- Next pass will continue chapter-by-chapter, prioritizing `[CRITICAL]`/`[HIGH]` items from `Improvements_1-Embers.md` and global Writing Rules compliance (especially **no “System”** in prose).
