## Structural Issues Flagged (Not Fixed — Require >30% Rewrite)

1. **5-1-02:** Should be at a second shrine/different province per outline. Currently stays at first shrine.
2. **5-1-05:** E:R ratio reflection-heavy (~1:3). Needs physical event to break up stream-side dialog.
3. **5-2-05:** "Same" leitwort still at 6 (vs 3 max) — 4 remaining uses in dialog, thematically necessary.
4. **5-3-05:** Outline calls for physical token from Sekte; chapter has verbal offer only.
5. **5-3-06:** Outline calls for SoL cooking beat; chapter has tea house + spiral instead.
6. **Part 6 overall:** E:R ratio ~1:3 skewed toward reflection (BLACKOUT is internal event — structural constraint).
7. **5-7-03:** Long analytical cascade explaining headache shift (6+ paragraphs). Thematic center — trimming damages key realization.
8. **5-7-04:** "Luck Debt" concept partially visible through context, could be subtler.
