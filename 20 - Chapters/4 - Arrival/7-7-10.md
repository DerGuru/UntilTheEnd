The cave.

She stands at the mouth and the standing is — arrival. Not return. The distinction matters. Return implies leaving and coming back to a place that has been held in memory as destination. Arrival implies reaching a place for the first time as the person you are now. She has never been here as this person. She has never been here old, white-haired, trembling-handed, mortal. She has never been here as someone who chose to come.

The cave has not changed.

The world has changed. Every mountain, every valley, every river and forest and village between then and now has been reshaped by the relentless revision that time performs on geography. Empires have risen and collapsed. Languages have been born and died. The species has crawled and built and burned and rebuilt and the surface of the planet has been rewritten a thousand times.

The cave has not changed.

The stone walls are the same stone walls. The mineral composition — grey, dense, the geological stubbornness of a formation that was old when she was young and is old now and will be old when everything else is new. The entrance is the same shape — irregular, narrower at the top, wider at the base, the organic geometry that water and time carved into the rock face before either of them had a name.

She enters.

The darkness is the same darkness. The gradual dimming that cave-entry produces — the light receding behind her, the visible world contracting to the rectangle of the entrance, the interior assembling itself from shadow into presence. The air is cool. The subterranean temperature that caves maintain regardless of the season above, the geological thermostat that keeps the interior at the constant cool of stone's preference.

Water drips. The same water? Different water, same drip. The same acoustic signature — plip, pause, plip — that a woman remembers from millennia ago, from the beginning, from the time when she was small enough that the cave was large and the drip was the only sound and the only sound was enough.

She sits.

On the floor. On the stone. The same stone — or the same position on the same stone, the location within the cave that a child chose because the child was small and the cave was large and this spot was far enough from the entrance to be warm and close enough to the entrance to see light.

The memory: cold. Small. Alone. A child in this cave. In THIS cave. On THIS stone. With the same dripping water and the same grey walls and the same entrance-shape letting in the same quality of light. The child was afraid. The child was alone. The child decided — not decided, BELIEVED — that she would not die because dying was unacceptable and unacceptability could be made permanent if you believed hard enough.

Now: old. Warm. Peaceful. A woman in this cave. In THIS cave. On THIS stone. With the same dripping water and the same grey walls and the same entrance-shape. The woman is not afraid. The woman is not alone — the fox-spirit is settling beside her, the warm weight of the animal pressing against her hip, amber eyes catching the entrance-light.

Through the entrance: clouds.

Visible through the irregular opening — the framed view that the cave provides, the rectangular window that contains a portion of sky. The clouds are — moving. Drifting. The particular slow transit of high-altitude formations, the water-vapor expressions of atmospheric conditions that exist above the concerns of the surface.

Yun. 云. Cloud.

Her name. Her name IS cloud. The linguistic coincidence — or not coincidence — that places her identity in the sky, in the formless, in the dissolving. Clouds form and move and dissolve and the dissolving is not death. The dissolving is transition. Water becoming vapor becoming cloud becoming rain becoming water. The cycle that does not end because it does not need to end because the ending is the beginning of the next beginning.

She watches the clouds through the entrance. The fox-spirit watches with her. The amber eyes reflect the light — bright, steady, the luminous quality of eyes that see without judging and watch without commenting and are present without condition.

She is tired. The physical tiredness of a body that has climbed a mountain with old knees and is sitting on stone with old bones and is experiencing the gravitational honesty of a mortal body at the end of a long day and a long journey and a long life.

She is tired and the tiredness is — different from every tiredness before. Not the millennia-spanning weariness that was the first sentence of the first book. Not the bone-deep philosophical exhaustion of a being that has lived too long and cannot stop. This tiredness is physical and immediate and FINITE. This tiredness has a solution. The solution is rest. The solution is the surrendering of consciousness that the body performs when the body has done enough and the enough is — enough.

She sits in the cave. Her cave. The first cave. The last cave. The same cave.

The clouds move through the entrance. The water drips. The fox-spirit breathes beside her.

She breathes.

She is home.
