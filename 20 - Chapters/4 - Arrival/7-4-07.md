He cooked carefully.

That was the first sign — the deviation from routine that communicated something the words hadn't yet. Xu Ran cooked the way he did everything: methodically, competently, without ambition. Rice. Water. Heat. The triangle of sustenance that he traversed daily with the efficiency of a man who treated food as fuel and cooking as procedure.

Tonight was different. Three ingredients instead of one. Preparation steps instead of the usual dump-and-heat. He washed the grain twice. He sliced something green — a wild onion, foraged from the mountainside, the bitter green that grew in the shallow soil between rocks. He found a root — ginger, improbable at this altitude, but present, the aromatic tuber that transformed adequate into almost-good.

He was cooking as though it mattered.

"You must become powerless," he said, over the pot, "to use the most powerful power."

The sentence arrived while he was stirring. The steam rose between us. The fire was larger than usual — he'd built it carefully, the architectural attention of a fire assembled rather than started, each stick placed with intention rather than efficiency.

I said nothing. The sentence was — complete. It didn't require response. It required sitting with.

"Is it clear to you," he continued, stirring, watching the pot with the attention he usually reserved for the notebook, "how absurd that sounds?"

"Yes."

"And it's still true?"

"Yes."

He stirred. The rice was doing something it had never done in Xu Ran's cooking: behaving. The culinary compliance of a grain responding to actual technique rather than exposure to heat and hope.

"I think I've written most of it," he said.

His voice was — careful. The tonal calibration of a man approaching a subject from the side because the front was guarded. The statement was about the notebook. The statement was about everything.

"The notebook," I said. Not a question. Not quite a statement. The word placed in the air between us like a piece on a board.

"Your story. As much as I could get. With gaps. With errors. With —" He gestured with the spoon. The gesture encompassed everything — the mountain, the trail, the months of walking and talking and the archaeological excavation of a life measured in geological time. "With ink stains."

I looked at the notebook. It was beside him — always beside him, the constant companion, the physical repository of everything he'd recorded. The covers were worn. The binding was — exhausted was the word. The material fatigue of paper and thread that had been opened and closed and carried and written in and rained on and slept beside and treated as the most important object in the world by someone whose standards for importance were extreme.

Both of us knew.

The knowledge was present in the clearing the way the steam was present — visible, atmospheric, impossible to ignore. The knowledge that the next part — the inward turn, the dissolution, the surrender — was singular. Was for one person. Was the solo journey that couldn't be witnessed without the witnessing becoming interference.

He served the food. Bowl to bowl, the democratic division that treated both portions as equally important. The rice was — I took a bite.

He'd made good rice.

The realization was small and enormous. Throughout every meal we'd shared — the mediocre rice, the burned rice, the adequate rice that defined his culinary range — he had been cooking within his normal parameters. Now, tonight, with three ingredients and actual technique and the attention that indicated effort rather than routine, he had made good rice.

He could ALWAYS cook good rice. He'd chosen not to. Or hadn't chosen to. The distinction was — I didn't pursue it. The rice was good and the rice was a farewell and the farewell was happening inside the rice rather than around it.

I ate everything. For the first time in weeks — not a bite, not a half bowl, not the partial consumption that indicated beginning-without-completion. Everything. The bowl was empty. The rice was gone. The finality of a meal consumed completely, the cleaned vessel that indicated actual appetite rather than obligatory response.

"It's good," I said.

"I know."

Almost a smile. The micro-expression that passed between us — the shared recognition that the rice was more than rice and the goodness of the rice was more than cooking and the sentence "It's good" was carrying more weight than three syllables should be asked to carry.

The fire died slowly. The embers glowed. The mountain was dark around us — the intimate darkness of high altitude nights, the darkness that was deeper than sea-level darkness because the air was thinner and the stars were sharper and the distance between firelight and nothing was shorter.

We sat. The bowls were empty. The pot was empty. The fire was dying.

The notebook was between us. Worn. Stained. Full. The physical form of years compressed into paper, the material evidence of a story told and recorded and preserved by a man who had made preservation his vocation.

Neither of us mentioned the morning.

We didn't need to.
