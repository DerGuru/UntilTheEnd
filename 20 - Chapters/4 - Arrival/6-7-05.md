I cooked.

The fire was mine — built from my kindling, my stones, my arrangement. The breath that coaxed the flame was the breath Wei taught me long ago, the controlled exhalation that said: not too much, not too little, just enough. The pot was positioned at the angle that experience — ancient, body-stored, hands-that-remembered — had determined was optimal for the size of the fire and the amount of water and the quantity of rice.

The rice was the last of the rice.

Not the last grain in the world. The last grain in the bag, the end of Xu Ran's provisions, the final portion of the food supply that had sustained the mortal half of our partnership across the last stretch of mountain path. After this, foraging. After this, whatever the mountain offered. But this — this pot, this fire, this moment — was the last of the carried rice.

I hadn't cooked since Wei.

The precision of that fact settled as I measured the water — too much, I knew it was too much even as I poured, but the hands that remembered how to build a fire had forgotten the ratio of water to rice and were improvising with the confidence of someone who had once known. Since Wei. Since the last time cooking had been something I did rather than something I avoided, the last time the act of preparing food over fire had been an action rather than a wound.

The rice cooked.

Slowly. The water rose to a boil with the patient inevitability of physics operating on liquid and heat. The rice expanded. Softened. Became — food. The transformation was ordinary, chemical, the mundane miracle of starch absorbing water and heat denaturing protein and the result being something a human body could use. I watched the process the way I'd watched Xu Ran pack — with the attention of someone learning to see the ordinary as sufficient.

It burned.

Not catastrophically. Not the dramatic, smoke-alarm, ruined-dinner kind of burning. The slow, bottom-of-the-pot burning that happens when someone is paying attention to the wrong layer — watching the surface while the base overcooks, monitoring the visible while the hidden goes wrong. The smell arrived first. Then the color change, the white darkening to brown at the edges, the cream yellowing where it touched the ceramic.

I pulled the pot off the fire.

The bottom layer was charred. Brown-black. The pattern of burning that I had seen exactly once before, in a different pot, over a different fire, in a different life. Wei's rice. Wei's burning. The grin and the crunch and the be quiet and the bowl pushed across.

The resemblance was not deliberate. I had not set out to recreate Wei's culinary failure. I had set out to cook rice and I had cooked it badly and the badness was the same badness because bad rice is bad rice regardless of who burns it, regardless of the millennium, regardless of the weight of the person holding the pot.

I stared at the burned pot.

The smoke — thin, grey, rising — carried everything. Not metaphorically. Literally: the smoke contained the vaporized starch of the last rice, the charred bottom, the heat and the water and the failure. And in carrying these physical materials it also carried, by association, by the chemistry of memory and sensation: everything. The wandering. The deaths. The search. The truth. The guilt. The insight. Years of walking and losing and finding and the, unresolvable question of whether her belief had killed a boy who burned rice better than she did.

In the smoke: everything.

Xu Ran appeared. He'd been tending to the camp — setting up the sleeping arrangement, checking the water skin, the minor logistics of evening. He looked at the pot. At me. At the pot.

He took his portion.

Silently. Without comment. Without the micro-expression of judgment or the calibrated observation that usually accompanied his assessment of situations. He served himself — the burned rice, the too-wet rice, the objectively bad rice — and he ate.

He ate the way Wei would have eaten.

He didn't know that. Couldn't know it. Had never met Wei, had only the notebook entries and her descriptions and the reconstructed portrait of a dead boy built from data and inference. But he ate Wei's bad rice the way Wei would have eaten it — without complaint, without comment, with the quiet of a man who understood that the food was not the point.

I served myself. The burned part. The worst of it — the charred crust that had to be broken from the bottom with the edge of the spoon, the pieces that crunched when bitten, the flavor that was acrid and bitter and tasted like failure.

I ate it.

And it tasted like something.

Not trauer. Not the heavy, draping grief that had made cooking impossible for years. Something else. Something that had grief in it the way tea had water in it — present, fundamental, but not the totality. The taste was — memory. And memory was bearable. Memory was even, at certain angles, in certain light, with certain rice: good.

The stars above. The fire below. The mountain around. The smoke rising, carrying everything, and the eating continuing nonetheless. 

Xu Ran finished his portion. Set the bowl down.

"Tomorrow," he said.

"Tomorrow."

The fire settled. The stars remained. The fox-spirit sat at the edge of the firelight, amber eyes reflecting the flames, the eternal witness to the eternal meal.

We had eaten the last rice.

In the morning there would be none.
