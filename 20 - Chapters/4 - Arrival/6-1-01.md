I woke to the taste of metal.

Not blood — the distinction matters, though both are iron. Blood tastes of salt and warmth and the organic sharpness of something that belongs inside and has come out. This was different. Clean metal. Cold. The taste of pressing your tongue against a coin or a blade or the tines of a fork. Present without source, without origin, without any physical explanation for why my mouth tasted like I'd been chewing on old iron in my sleep.

The fire was dead. Not dying — dead, the greyness of ashes that have surrendered their last heat hours ago and are now just the remains of what burning leaves behind. Xu Ran was still asleep on the other side of the pit, his head resting on his notebook — the waterproof case making an uncomfortable pillow that he'd been using since he'd run out of clothes to fold beneath his skull.

Morning. Grey sky. The kind of overcast that isn't weather so much as absence — no clouds precisely, just a uniform dimness that covers the sky like a lid.

I sat up. The cold was there immediately — a parting gift from the crack, the permanent sensory adjustment that had turned temperature from data into experience. The air against my face, the ground beneath my hands, the chill of mountain morning pressing through fabric and skin with the insistent physicality of something that wanted to be felt.

And the humming.

Not in my ears. In my teeth. A vibration — low, steady, the frequency of something mechanical operating just beyond hearing range. I could feel it in my molars, in the bones of my jaw, in the subtle resonance that travels through solid material when sound is too deep for air. As if someone had pressed a tuning fork to the base of my skull and left it there.

This was new. The feeling — the nameless frequency, the bass note vibration that had lived behind the sternum since the breakthrough — was old, familiar, a companion I'd carried since the moment I couldn't remember. But the teeth-vibration was different. Higher. More physical. More present. As if whatever lived inside the feeling had turned up its output and the overflow was leaking into my bones.

The metallic taste was its aftertaste. The residue. The sensory equivalent of exhaust from an engine that was running harder than before.

I stood. Stretched. My body complained in the catalogued way that bodies complain when they've slept on ground and are old enough to have opinions about it. Shoulders tight. Lower back aching. The headache — persistent, permanent, the cost of carrying whatever I carried — pulsing behind the eyes with the rhythm of my heartbeat.

The fox-spirit was awake. Lying beside my bedroll where it had been every morning for the past week, amber eyes open, watching me with the patient attention of something that was waiting. Not for food. Not for movement. Just waiting, the way a thing waits when it knows something is coming and hasn't been told what.

I walked to the river.

The water was cold and clear and ran over stones with the constant murmur that rivers use to fill silence. I knelt. Cupped water. Brought it to my face.

The cold hit like contact. Not the gentle sensation of water on skin — the full, sharp, detailed experience of temperature meeting nerve endings that had been calibrated for maximum sensitivity. Every droplet was distinct. Every rivulet that ran down my cheeks and dripped from my jaw carried its own exact coldness.

I opened my eyes.

My reflection was there.

In the still pool at the river's edge — the same kind of sheltered pocket that had held my face before, the same calm water that had shown me the smile — my face looked back.

I turned away.

Not slowly. Not with the measured consideration of someone who has decided to look elsewhere. Fast. The quick, instinctive aversion of someone who has seen something they're not ready to see again and has chosen distance over engagement.

The reflection had been just a reflection. My face. Tired, thin, honest. Not smiling. Not doing anything it shouldn't have been doing. Just there.

But the memory of the last time — the smile that preceded mine, the warmth, the understanding — was present, and the presence of that memory made looking at my own face feel dangerous. Not because the reflection might do something again. Because I might feel something if it did.

I washed my face. Quickly. Without looking at the water.

Xu Ran was awake when I returned. He'd coaxed something from the dead fire — not flame, not even embers, but the optimism of a man who was adding kindling to ashes and breathing on them with the stubborn determination that had gotten fires lit a thousand times before.

"Morning," he said.

"Morning."

The fire caught. Small, tentative, the first orange tongue licking at dry bark with the nervous energy of flame finding its conditions met. Xu Ran fed it. Pine needles first, then twigs, then the careful architecture of larger pieces that would sustain the burn.

He looked at me. The assessment — the quick, thorough, automatic scan that he'd been performing every morning since the clearing, the calibration of how-is-she-today. His eyes tracked my posture, my face, the way I held my hands.

"Something new?" he asked.

"The taste. Metal."

He nodded. Reached for his notebook — then stopped. The notebook was closed. Had been closed since the collapse, since the day he'd decided that documentation had reached its limits and whatever came next was mine.

He opened it.

The gesture was significant. He'd been keeping it closed — a discipline, a boundary, a statement about the limits of observation. But something in what I'd said — the metal, the taste, the newness of it — had overridden the discipline.

He wrote one line. Closed it again.

I ate breakfast — cold rice from last night, because the fire was too young for boiling water and I was too hungry for patience. The rice was the rice. Grain-neutral. The one constant in a life of variables.

The humming pulsed in my teeth. Stronger than when I'd woken. The metallic taste was denser, coating my tongue with the aftertaste of something that was neither food nor drink but was being processed by the same systems.

Something had changed. Not the crack — the crack was there, stable, the loose tooth in the wall's architecture that I could press against and feel give. Not the feeling — the feeling was there, the nameless frequency, the thing behind the sternum that the deletion couldn't reach.

Something else. Something additional. As if the feeling had been running at one speed since the breakthrough and had, overnight, shifted gears. The output was higher. The resonance was wider. The overflow was leaking into my bones and my teeth and the taste receptors on my tongue.

I didn't know what it meant. The wall was quiet — no headache-warnings, no preemptive interventions, no gentle refusals disguised as pain. Whatever was happening was either below the wall's threat threshold or above its jurisdiction.

The fox-spirit stood. Stretched. Padded to my side and sat, close enough that its fur brushed my leg.

The morning opened like mornings do — gradually, without announcement, the grey lid of overcast thinning until the light was light and the day was day and the business of being alive resumed its usual priority of forward motion.

I packed. Xu Ran packed. We left the camp and the dead fire and the river where my reflection had been just a reflection, and we walked.

The teeth hummed. The metal tasted. The world was sharper and louder and colder than any world should be, and somewhere deep inside — below the wall, below the crack, in the bedrock where the ancient thing breathed — the feeling pulsed harder.

Something was coming.

I was almost ready.

Almost.
