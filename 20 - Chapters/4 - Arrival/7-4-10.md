Morning. Early. Dew on the grass.

Xu Ran was standing. The pack was on his back — not slung, not resting, not the casual placement of a traveler pausing between steps. Shouldered. Strapped. The settled weight of a pack that had been put on for the last time in a direction.

The notebook was under his arm. The leather was dark with age and handling and the accumulated moisture of mornings like this one, dew-mornings, early-mornings, the mornings that existed in the temperature range between night and day where water hung on everything and the world was wet with becoming.

I stood.

We faced each other. The clearing between us was small — three steps, two, the distance that had been our constant and was now our final.

"It's complete," he said.

"Nothing is complete."

"Close enough."

The phrase was his. The Xu Ran philosophy compressed into two words — the rejection of perfection in favor of sufficiency, the pragmatic acknowledgment that done was more valuable than perfect and that the gap between them was habitable.

"I've written everything down," he said. "As well as I could. The story of a woman who has seen everything and still sits here."

"That sounds depressing."

"That sounds HUMAN."

The reframing. The Xu Ran reframing that took the shape I'd given something and turned it three degrees and made it different and the different was — truer. Not happier. Truer. The distinction that he insisted on and that I was still learning to value.

He held the notebook. The physical object — paper and leather and ink and thread. The material form that contained years of walking and talking and the excavation of a life too long for one volume and recorded in one volume anyway. Dog-eared. Stained. Some pages water-damaged — rain? I didn't examine the alternative. The creases at the corners spoke of usage that exceeded design specifications, the structural fatigue of paper that had been asked to hold more than paper was built to hold.

He was taking it with him.

Of course he was. He'd written it. The work was his — the hand, the ink, the calligraphic decisions that turned my words into his characters. The content was mine. The form was his. The object belonged to the act of recording rather than to either of us individually.

I didn't ask to keep it.

The not-asking was — everything. The release. The act of letting an object go that represented letting a person go that represented letting a period go that represented — the thing I was trying to learn.

"Where will you go?" I asked.

"Down."

"And then?"

"Somewhere that needs a story."

His profession. His identity. The vocational permanence of a man who was, at his core, someone who recorded what happened and went somewhere else and recorded what happened there. The itinerant chronicler. The man with the brush. The best distraction I'd ever had.

"Thank you," I said.

The words were inadequate. The insufficiency of gratitude expressed in two syllables for something that required — more. More syllables. More time. More of the language that could carry weight. But two syllables were what I had and what I offered and the offering was — close enough.

His phrase. Given back.

He nodded. The nod contained — I didn't catalog it. Some things were better left uncataloged. The nod was the nod and the nod was sufficient.

He turned.

He walked.

Not fast. Not slow. The pace of a man who was leaving because leaving was correct and who was not hurrying because hurrying would diminish the departure. The pack sat on his back. The notebook was under his arm. His feet found the trail — the downward trail, the direction away, the path that led from this clearing to everywhere else.

I watched.

The clearing was still. The dew was present. The sun was arriving — the first edge of light touching the ridge, the golden line that separated night from day and past from future and together from alone.

He didn't look back.

That was — right. Looking back would have been — different. Would have been the gesture that converted departure into drama, that elevated leaving into loss, that turned a man walking away into a symbol of something being taken.

He was a man walking away. Walking toward something else. Walking because walking was what he did between the recording and the next recording, the ambulatory process that connected stories.

The trail took him behind the ridge. The pack. The notebook. The brush. The flat voice and the surgical humor and the three-step distance and the terrible cooking and the one night of good rice.

Behind the ridge. Gone.

The clearing was — empty. No. Not empty. Cleared. The difference between absence and presence-removed, between nothing and something-that-was-and-no-longer-is. The clearing contained the shape of where he'd been the way the sky contained the shape of where clouds had been.

The fox-spirit was beside me. Amber eyes. Looking at the ridge. Looking at me. Looking at the ridge again.

The wind moved the grass. Real wind. Mountain wind. The atmospheric movement that was weather and nothing more and the certainty of that — the KNOWING that the wind was wind — was new and fragile and mine.

I stood in the clearing and the morning was arriving and the dew was evaporating and somewhere on the other side of the ridge a man was walking with a notebook that contained my life and I had let him take it and the letting was —

I let him go. I let everything go. And for the first time, that wasn't the same as losing.
