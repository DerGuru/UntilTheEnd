The flood came at dusk.

Not water. Memory. The liquidity of the past when the dam breaks — not a single memory surfacing but all of them, simultaneously, the complete archive of a life measured in millennia deciding that NOW was the moment to empty itself.

We were sitting by the evening fire. The rice was cooking. Xu Ran was writing — the daily ritual, the documentation, the obsessive recording that was both his purpose and his anchor. The fox-spirit was sleeping or pretending to sleep, amber eyes cracked to slits, one ear tracking sounds the rest of us couldn't hear.

I was looking at the fire.

The fire was a mistake. Flames — the color, the movement, the way light danced on surfaces and made shadows leap — were connective tissue to everything I'd burned and everything that had burned around me and everything that had existed in the temperature range between cold and too hot and the fire was a door and I opened it.

Names.

They came as names first. Not faces — the faces followed, the visual reconstruction lagging behind the verbal the way subtitle lagged behind speech. Names I hadn't spoken in centuries. Names I hadn't thought in longer. Names that had been filed in the mental archive where the mind stores things it can't use and can't discard: the dead.

Lin Feiyun. The woman who had taught me to grind medicinal paste. Dead. How? When? The details were gone but the name was permanent and the permanence was obscene.

Zhang Wei — not my Wei, another Wei entirely, a child in a village I'd passed through during the second century or the third, a boy with a birthmark that covered half his face like a map of a country that didn't exist. He'd offered me a piece of fruit. I'd eaten it. He'd died of — something. Later. The specifics erased by time but the name remaining, the persistence of identifier outlasting identified.

They came faster.

Merchant in a river town. Cook in a traveling company. Soldier who had deserted and lived as a woodcutter and made furniture that was beautiful in the way that things made by hands that had been trained for violence were beautiful. All dead. All gone. All — stored. Filed. Retained by a mind that couldn't forget because the body wouldn't let it, the immortal cruelty of a memory that expanded rather than compressed, that accumulated rather than pruned.

Xu Ran looked up from his writing.

"How many?" he asked.

I didn't answer because the answer was still arriving, the count still incrementing, the flood still flowing. Faces now — thousands of them, overlapping, translucent, the visual congestion of too many images competing for the same mental space. The cook's burned hands and the soldier's quiet eyes and the child's birthmark and the woman's grinding motion and —

"Yun."

His voice was anchor. The frequency that cut through the noise, the combination of vowel and consonant that my mind had been trained to recognize as important, as present, as now.

"I can't — " The sentence fractured. The air fractured. Around us, the grass was — breathing.

That was the only word for it. The grass around the fire was growing and dying and growing and dying in rhythm with my breathing, the botanical oscillation of a landscape responding to the emotional frequency of a woman whose feelings were alternating between memory and presence, between grief and survival, between then and now.

The grass grew. Green shoots rising impossibly fast, reaching toward a sun that wasn't there, the nighttime growth of vegetation powered by feeling rather than photosynthesis. Then dying — the shoots browning, collapsing, returning to the soil they'd risen from. Then growing again. The cycle was visible and organic and it matched the rate of my breathing with a precision that was the opposite of coincidence.

Xu Ran's brush moved. He was writing fast — faster than I'd seen, the characters appearing dense and urgent, the ink insufficient for the documentation rate, the dots appearing where characters should have been because there wasn't enough brush for what he was trying to record.

"Slower," he said. To himself, not to me. "Slower. Can't —"

He couldn't keep up.

The names continued. A fisherman. Two sisters who ran a tea house. An old man who carved jade with hands that shook and produced work that didn't. A woman who sang to horses because she believed they understood and maybe they did and she was dead and the horses were dead and the songs were dead and the jade had survived because jade was stone and stone outlasted everything except time and time outlasted everything.

My breathing was ragged. The grass responded. Grow. Die. Grow. Die. The cycle around me was expanding — not just grass now but the small flowers that dotted the campsite, opening and closing, blooming and wilting, the floral equivalent of hyperventilation.

"Slow your breathing," Xu Ran said.

"I'm not controlling my breathing."

"I know. Slow it anyway."

The contradiction was the point. Control the automatic. Override the autonomous. Management of a force that wasn't designed for management but demanded it anyway.

I tried. The breathing slowed — marginally, the modest deceleration of a body negotiating with its own reflexes. The grass cycle slowed with it. The flowers opened and closed and opened at a pace that was — almost — natural.

Almost.

The names were still coming. Quieter now. Not the flood but the aftermath of flood, the receding water revealing the landscape it had covered, the inventory of damage that followed inundation.

"Places that don't exist anymore," I said. "Cities. Villages. Whole —" I gestured at nothing. At everything. At the spatial absence that represented a geography that had been replaced by other geography, the palimpsest of landscape that only immortals could read.

Xu Ran was writing dots. Small, precise dots where names should have been. The ink was running low and the names were running long and the ratio was unsustainable and he wrote dots because dots were sufficient and because the notebook was finite and memory wasn't.

The fox-spirit's eyes were fully open now. The amber watched the grass breathing and the flowers cycling and the fire flickering in patterns that weren't wind-patterns but grief-patterns, the irregular rhythm of a flame responding to an emotion rather than an atmosphere.

"I don't know all their names," I said. "I knew them once. Some of them. But —"

"That's worse?"

"Yes."

He understood. The horror of partial forgetting — not the clean absence of never-knowing but the degraded file, the corrupted memory, the face without a name or the name without a face. The people who deserved to be remembered completely and were remembered only in fragments and the fragments were insufficient and the insufficiency was —

The grass died. All of it. A circle around the fire, two meters in diameter, going brown simultaneously, the synchronized botanical death of vegetation that had exhausted itself cycling between life and death at the frequency of a woman's breathing.

The flowers were closed. The fire was low.

I stopped talking. The names retreated — not gone, never gone, just receding to the depth where they lived between summonings, the mental aquifer that held the dead.

Xu Ran set down his brush. The page was full of dots.

You couldn't keep up. You knew you couldn't. You wrote dots instead of names and the dots were honest and the honesty was more than I deserved.

"That's enough for today," he said.

I agreed. Not with words. With silence. The silence of a woman who had just reviewed the inventory of her losses and found it uncountable and was now sitting by a fire that was dying because she was tired and the fire was hers and her things died when she was tired and there was nothing to do about that except wait for morning.

The grass would regrow. Some of it.

Some of it wouldn't.
