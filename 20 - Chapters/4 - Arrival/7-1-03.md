The memory came unbidden.

I was pushing again — a fourth attempt, a fifth, the repetition becoming rhythm, the rhythm becoming its own kind of meditation — when the sediment stirred. The way a river's bottom stirs when you walk through it: particles that have been settled for ages suddenly suspended, swirling, filling the water with the opacity of disturbed time.

The memory was old.

Not the eons-spanning recall that had surfaced during the twist. Older. Deeper. The oldest sediment, the layer at the bottom of everything, compacted by the weight of all the layers above it into something nearly geological.

A cave.

Cold. The cold of stone that has never been touched by sun — not seasonal cold, not weather cold, the absolute, permanent cold of underground. Walls close — closer than expected, closer than I'd remembered, the space narrowing as the image sharpened. Rough stone under fingers that were not these fingers — younger fingers? Smaller? The memory couldn't clarify. The fingers were mine and also not mine and the distinction didn't matter because the feeling was the same: cold stone, tight space, alone.

Alone.

At the beginning. Always at the beginning. Before Wei, before the wandering, before the cultivation, before the eons of accumulated existence built their layers upon layers. At the very beginning: a cave, cold stone, and no one.

"What do you see?" Xu Ran asked.

His voice — distant, filtered through the membrane that separated the present from the deepest past. I was in both places simultaneously — on the mountain and in the cave, sitting in spring air and breathing cold stone, an adult who had lived for eons and a — what? A child? Something younger than what I was now, something that existed at the origin point of whatever I had become.

"Nothing," I said.

But my face — I could feel it betraying me. The moisture at the corners of my eyes that wasn't crying, the tension in my jaw that wasn't anger, the hands reaching for something that existed in memory and not in space. My face said everything that my mouth refused.

"Describe nothing," he said.

The precision of a scholar. The, clinical instruction that bypassed the emotional blockade and addressed the intellectual apparatus. Describe nothing. Not what do you feel, not are you okay, not any of the empathy-coded questions that would have permitted me to deflect. Describe. Clinical. Factual.

"Cold," I said. "Tight. Stone."

"Where?"

"A cave. Small. Underground, I think. The light — there is no light. Or very little. What comes in is grey."

"When?"

"The beginning."

He stopped writing. The brush paused — mid-stroke, ink glistening on the paper, the motion arrested by the weight of two words. The beginning. He looked at me. The clinical mask recalibrated: less scholar, more — something. Something that lived beneath the clinical surface and emerged at exact moments of exact gravity.

"Your beginning?"

"I think so."

The images were fragmentary but CLEAR. Clearer than the field's compressed transmissions, clearer than the twist's eons-recall. The self-protection was weaker here — weakened by the pushing, by the repetitive attempts at mortality that had been battering against it like waves against a seawall. Not broken. Weakened. Enough that the deepest memories could surface through the cracks.

Stone under fingers. Cold. The absence of other bodies — the, physical absence that a child registers not as concept but as sensation. No warmth from another source. No breathing that isn't yours. No sound that doesn't come from stone or water or the small, involuntary noises of a body existing in a space too small and too cold for comfort.

"I was alone," I said. "At the beginning. There was a cave and I was in it and I was alone."

Xu Ran wrote. The brush moved with the careful, measured strokes of a man documenting something irreplaceable — each word placed with the weight-consciousness of someone who understood that this record might be the only record, that what she was saying now might never be said again.

"How old?" he asked.

"Young. I don't — the memory doesn't give ages. Just the body. Small. Cold. The hands are smaller than mine."

"What else?"

"Water. Dripping. Somewhere deeper. The sound of it — constant. Like the cave's heartbeat."

The image faded. Not vanished — settled, the way sediment settles when the walking stops. It was there, beneath, available, but no longer surfacing. The origin had shown itself: a cave, a child, cold stone, solitude. The beginning had been the same as what the end would be. The circle — from cave to cave, from solitude to solitude, from cold stone to cold stone — was visible now.

I opened my eyes. The mountain. Xu Ran. The fox-spirit at its careful distance, watching.

"That's where it started," I said.

"A cave."

"A cave."

He looked at me. Something in his expression — the recognition, the understanding of a man who had spent his life seeking origins and had just been shown one. He looked at me and I could see the calculations running behind his eyes: the cave at the beginning, the cave at the end, the symmetry that he would note in the margin with a small, precise mark.

"She started alone," he said. Third person. Speaking to the notebook, not to me. The voice of the chronicler. "In a cave. Cold. Small. The dripping of water like a heartbeat."

He wrote.

I sat in the mountain air and the metallic taste was there and the memory was there and the clouds moved overhead and the origin had been shown and it was: a child in a cave, alone, at the beginning of everything.
