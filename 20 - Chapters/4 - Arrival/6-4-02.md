I sat by the fire. Hands on knees. Eyes open.

But I wasn't here.

The transition was seamless — no gap, no threshold, no moment of departure. I was in the clearing, and then I was in the memory, and the two states coexisted the way the two sides of a mirror coexist: opposite, simultaneous, each one reflecting the other into infinity.

The memory was clear.

Not the painful, fragmented clarity of recollection fighting through the wall's interference. This was glass-clear. Transparent. The kind of clarity that doesn't belong to memory because memory is always reconstructive, always interpretive, always filtered through the distance between then and now. This clarity was primary. Unmediated. The clarity of experience, not recollection.

I was there.

The place — the place before places, the place that was everywhere and nowhere, the place I'd seen in the creation fragments — was a state. Not a geography. Not a location on a map that didn't exist. A condition. The condition of being before being, the state from which states emerge. I stood in it the way you stand in light — surrounded, immersed, unable to identify the boundary between self and medium.

And I created — or so the vision insisted.

The creating was — I saw it now, partially, through the wall's remaining interference, through the fragments' abbreviation. I saw myself — not the self I was now, not Yun the wanderer, Yun the cultivator, Yun the woman standing in rivers and moving stones. An earlier self. A self that existed before names, before forms, before the categories that consciousness uses to divide experience into manageable portions.

I created because creating might have been what I was.

Not what I did — what I might have been. The distinction felt fundamental. I didn't create the way a sculptor creates — imposing form on material, shaping external substance into intended configurations. I created the way the sun creates light — by existing. By being. The creating was not separate from the being. Or so the memory insisted. The creating was the being.

I believed.

That was the mechanism. The same mechanism that moved the stones and redirected the water, but at a scale so vast that the word *mechanism* collapsed under its own inadequacy. I believed things into existence. Not imagined — believed. Not wished — convinced. The, absolute, irrefutable certainty that preceded language and exceeded thought and constituted reality itself.

*Here is light.* And light was.

*Here is form.* And form condensed from the formless.

*Here is time.* And time began, not because time needed to begin but because I believed in its beginning and the belief was the beginning.

The memory showed me the WHY.

Fear. The oldest fear. The fear of ending — of the creating stopping, of the being ceasing, of the self dissolving back into the state from which it had emerged. The fear was irrational, because the self that feared ending was the self that had created beginning, and a self that could create beginning could presumably create continuation. But fear is not rational. Fear is the foundational conviction that precedes logic, and my fear — the fear of ending — was the deepest conviction I held.

So I believed myself immortal.

Not as a technique. Not as a cultivation achievement. Not as any of the framings I'd used for millennia to explain why I didn't die. I believed myself immortal the way I believed light into existence — absolutely, foundationally, with the total, unconditional certainty of a self that could make its beliefs real.

The belief became true. As all my beliefs became true. My immortality was not discovered. Not bestowed. Not achieved. Created. By me. From me. The product of a fear so old that it had become invisible.

And then — because immortality required a world in which to be immortal, and a form in which to experience the world, and a time in which the experience could unfold — I believed those too. World. Form. Time. Each one created by the same mechanism, each one sustained by the same certainty, each one as real as the belief that made it real.

My lips were moving.

In the clearing — the other reality, the one where my body sat with its hands on its knees and its eyes open and its conscious mind absent — my lips were forming words. Not my words. Words from the memory. Words from the creating — the formulations, the statements, the acts of belief that had produced world and form and time and immortality. Words in a language that didn't exist yet because the language was being created by the words themselves.

"Yun?"

Xu Ran's voice. Distant. Arriving through the membrane between the memory and the present, filtered, attenuated, like sound through water.

No response.

"YUN."

Loud. Sharp. Wrong — wrong name, wrong tone, the voice of a man whose calm had fractured against the surface of a situation his calm wasn't designed for. Three hours of sitting beside a woman who wasn't present, who was somewhere else, somewhere unreachable, somewhere that predated the existence of the place where they were sitting.

No response.

The fog outside the clearing pulled back. Not naturally — not the gradual dispersal of water vapor under solar influence. The fog withdrew. Retreated. Made space. As if the reality surrounding the clearing had recognized that something was happening inside the clearing that required room, that demanded accommodation, that the ordinary operations of weather and atmosphere needed to step aside for.

The clearing was bright.

Sunlight appeared — sudden, total, the light falling into the space the fog had vacated with the completeness of something that had been waiting for permission. The light fell on Yun's face, on her moving lips, on her open eyes that saw something that wasn't the clearing and wasn't the fire and wasn't the fog and wasn't the mountain.

Something older.

Something that was her.

Xu Ran sat beside her. His notebook was open — open for the first time since the data had exceeded the medium. He was writing. Fast. Catching the words her lips formed. Catching the changes in her expression. Catching whatever he could catch of a process he couldn't see, couldn't access, couldn't participate in.

His handwriting was tight. Rushed. Nearly illegible.

He wrote because writing was the only thing he could do.

And she was somewhere before the world, remembering how she'd made it.
