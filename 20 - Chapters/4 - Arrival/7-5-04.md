The panic is physical.

Not mental — not the cognitive panic of a mind recognizing danger and constructing a response. PHYSICAL. The body seizing. The hands clenching — fists forming automatically, fingers curling inward, nails digging into palms with the pressure that produces crescents in the skin. The jaw locking. The teeth meeting with a click that echoes in the cave.

The qi slams back.

HARD. The word is inadequate — the force is more than hard, more than sudden, more than the simple return of a mechanism to its default state. The qi CRASHES into place like a door slammed by a hurricane, the violent restoration of a condition that has been momentarily interrupted and will NOT be interrupted again. The cells stop hesitating. The cells GRIP. The biological machinery that has maintained immortality for millennia returns to operation with the ferocity of a force that has been threatened and will now overcompensate.

The burn mark heals.

She watches it. Black becomes grey. Grey becomes light. Light becomes — nothing. The fabric smoothing, the fibers reconstructing, the material reversal that demonstrates the qi's reach: not just the body but everything the body considers SELF. The clothing is self. The clothing heals.

The mark is gone.

Three seconds — no, seven. Seven seconds of evidence, erased in two. The physical proof of mortality eliminated by the physical reflex of survival. The stone tablet of her achievement wiped clean by the hand that built the wall.

She breathes. Heavy. The breathing of a body in the aftermath of danger — the overcompensated gulping, the chest expanding beyond comfort because every instinct has sent the ALL-HANDS signal and the lungs are responding with everything they have.

Sweat. On her forehead. On her palms — the palms that the nails just marked, the crescents already healing, the skin already returning to its unmarked state. The moisture of fear-response, the chemical signature of a body that has encountered what it interprets as mortal threat and has deployed every countermeasure it possesses.

Her pulse. In her ears. The auditory intrusion of a heartbeat so strong it becomes sound, the cardiovascular system running at maximum output, the heart hammering against the chest wall with the urgency of an organ that believes — BELIEVES, at the cellular level — that its existence is threatened.

The fire burns. The same fire. The same cave. The same dripping water. Everything identical except the woman sitting in the cave, who is shaking.

Not from cold. From reflex.

The survival reflex. The one that predates thought, predates language, predates everything except the most fundamental biological imperative: CONTINUE. The reflex that has been running — uninterrupted, unquestioned, unchallenged — for millennia. The reflex that built the wall. The reflex that IS the wall. The ancient programming that converts the threat of cessation into the absolute command to persist.

She unclenches her hands. Slowly. The fingers straightening one by one, the sequential release of muscles that have been holding with everything they have. The palms are smooth. The crescent marks are gone. The body has already repaired itself.

Three seconds of mortality. Seven seconds of proof. And then: the body pulls the emergency brake with a force that makes the mortality feel like a mistake and the proof feel like a hallucination and the whole experience feel like something that happened to someone else.

But it didn't happen to someone else.

It happened to her. In this cave. By this fire. Seven seconds ago.

The burn mark is gone. The evidence is erased. The fabric is smooth and grey and unmarked and immortal.

But she knows.

She knows it was there. She counted. One through seven. Seven seconds. Seven REAL seconds in which the clothing burned and the body was heavy and time flowed through and the cells hesitated and mortality was not a concept but a CONDITION.

The water drips. The cave echoes. The fire crackles.

She sits in the aftermath of panic and the aftermath is the truth: she is still afraid. The wall is still there. The reflex is still operational. The survival mechanism that a child built in a cave millennia ago is still functioning, still vigilant, still stronger than intention, still deeper than understanding.

Her hands tremble. She watches them tremble. She lets them.

Outside the cave, the wind changes direction. The sound shifts — a different whistle, a different pressure, the atmospheric signature of weather deciding to become different weather. The fire leans toward the cave mouth. Steadies.

She is still sitting.

She is still here.

The burn mark is gone.

But it was real.
