Walking. Training in motion.

The leaves floated.

Not all of them — three, four at a time, plucked from my attention rather than from the trees. I didn't reach for them. Didn't focus. The belief was becoming easier to access — not will, not intention, the subtler thing beneath both: the knowing. The leaves float. Not because I say so. Because they do. Because in this arrangement of reality, leaves float, and the arrangement is the true one.

Three leaves, hovering at shoulder height, drifting beside me like small, patient escorts. Brown-gold, autumn-touched though the season was spring. They floated because the floating was real, and when I stopped knowing, they fell, and the falling was also real.

"So you've spent your entire life believing you can't die," Xu Ran said.

He walked beside me now. The three-step distance had closed permanently since the ridge, replaced by the side-by-side arrangement of equals — or of two people who had stopped pretending that proximity was a variable.

"Yes."

"And that belief — that conviction — is what makes it true."

"Yes."

"Then just believe something else."

I let the leaves fall. Looked at him. He was walking with the steady stride of a man making a point, his face set in the arrangement that meant he was deploying logic and expected the logic to be received as provisional.

"That's not how it works."

"Why not?"

Silence. Four steps. Five. A bird somewhere — not within the silent radius, which had shrunk slightly as I gained control, but at the edge of it, tentative, the first sound of wildlife testing whether the danger zone had contracted enough to permit song.

"Why not," I repeated.

"You can believe a leaf floats. You can believe water rises. You can believe a flower blooms. Each of those is a contradiction of how the world normally works, and you do them — easily, now. Playfully. So why can't you believe one more thing? One more contradiction?"

The logic was seductive. Elegant. Wrong. But wrong in a way that was difficult to articulate because the wrongness lived in the place where logic couldn't reach — the substrate, the marrow, the bone-deep architecture that preceded rational analysis.

"Belief isn't chosen," I said.

He waited.

"The leaves float because I KNOW they float. Not because I decide they should. Not because I want them to. I know it the way I know gravity — not as theory but as fact. The knowing precedes the decision. The knowing IS the decision."

"And?"

"And I KNOW I'm immortal. The same way. The same depth. The same certainty. Telling myself I'm mortal is like telling myself gravity goes up. I can know it for a leaf — the leaf is outside me, the leaf is a separate thing, the leaf's physics are not MY physics. But MY physics — the laws that govern this body, this existence — those laws are written in the conviction that has been accumulating since the cave. Since the beginning. Since before I knew what conviction was."

Xu Ran considered. Walking. The trail was gentler here — a plateau between ascents, the mountain offering a brief horizontal mercy before the next incline.

"You can't decide to believe," he said.

"No. Belief arises. Like a feeling. You can't decide to feel love. You can't decide to feel fear. You can feel them, or not feel them, but the feeling isn't a choice. The belief is the same. It exists or it doesn't. And the belief that I am immortal EXISTS — in every cell, in every particle of qi, in the structure of whatever I am. I can't un-believe it by deciding to un-believe it."

"Then what?"

"Then I stop holding it. Not un-believe — stop holding. The way you stop gripping. Not choosing to release — letting go of the choice to hold."

He was quiet for a dozen steps.

"Try something smaller," he said.

"Smaller?"

"Not 'I am mortal.' That's — the whole building. Try a brick. One brick. One small, exact belief. Not the whole conviction. A corner of it."

He was right. The rightness was structural — the logic of dismantlement rather than demolition. You don't bring down a building by declaring it doesn't exist. You find a brick. You find the mortar around the brick. You work the mortar.

"My finger could bleed," I said.

Not my finger WILL bleed. Not my finger MUST bleed. Could. The smallest possible opening — the conditional, the hypothetical, the suggestion that the laws governing this body might, under certain circumstances, permit the ordinary function of vulnerability.

My qi — shifted. Not released. Not surrendered. Shifted. A momentary hesitation in the grid of certainty that kept my body immortal, the, localized flicker of a conviction adjusting to accommodate a new possibility. Like a wall developing a hairline crack — not structural failure but the acknowledgment that the structure was not, perhaps, absolute.

One heartbeat. Two.

The crack sealed. The qi stabilized. The conviction re-established itself with the efficient speed of a structure that had been maintaining its integrity for millennia and had developed robust protocols for handling anomalies.

But it had been there. The hesitation. The flicker. The opening that lasted a heartbeat and proved that the wall was not welded shut.

"Something happened," Xu Ran said.

"A hesitation."

"From the conviction?"

"From me."

He wrote. Two characters. Probably: hesitated. Once. The shortest, most significant entry in a notebook that had been filling for years.

The leaves on the ground stirred in a breeze that might have been wind and might have been the residual discharge of a conviction being tested for the first time.

Progress. The kind measured in heartbeats rather than pages. But progress.
