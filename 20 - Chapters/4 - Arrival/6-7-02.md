The tree was old. Older than Xu Ran, younger than me — a comparison that applied to most things, a taxonomy so broad it was functionally useless. The tree was old in the tree-sense: thick-trunked, root-tangled, the kind of tree that had been growing long enough to stop being a tree and start being geography. The roots had wrapped around stones and incorporated them. The canopy was its own weather system.

We rested beneath it. The shade was cool, exact, the filtered-light-and-temperature that large trees create beneath themselves. Xu Ran sat against a root. His pack beside him. The knife in his hand — the small one, the folding blade he used for everything from peeling ginger to cleaning his nails to the activity he was performing now.

Carving.

A stick. Pine, probably. He'd been shaping it since we sat down — long strokes with the blade, the shavings curling off and falling, the rhythm of someone who knew how to use a knife on wood but was not invested in the outcome. He was carving because his hands needed occupation. The same reason I'd been washing clothes in the river. The same reason anyone does anything with their hands while their mind is somewhere else.

He stopped. Looked at the shape. Whatever it had been becoming, it wasn't that anymore. He snapped it and tossed the pieces.

Not frustration. Beiläufigkeit. Casualness. The disposal of something that had served its purpose — hand-occupation — and no longer needed to exist.

"I knew," he said.

The words came with the same beiläufigkeit as the tossed wood. Sideways. Casual. Thrown over the shoulder of the moment as if they weren't the most honest thing he'd said in years.

I waited.

"Not the details." He folded the knife. Put it back in his pocket. Looked at the roots, the stone, the tree's patient architecture. "The feeling."

He turned his head. Looked at me. The look — direct, unguarded, the openness that Xu Ran allowed himself once every several hundred pages when the clinical mask served no purpose and the rawness underneath was the more accurate communication.

"I've known since the beginning that something was — not right isn't the word. Not wrong. Different. That you were different in a way that wasn't just ability or cultivation or any of the explanations I pretended were sufficient. I wrote it in the notebook. Not explicitly. I circled it. Approached it from different angles. Drew diagrams that didn't quite connect. But the feeling — the feeling was there from the first entry."

I looked at the tree. The roots, wrapping stone, incorporating what couldn't be moved. The patience of organic architecture.

He continued. "When the twist came — at the river, when you said it — I wasn't surprised. I was confirmed. The way you confirm a diagnosis that you've suspected since the first symptom. Relief and grief simultaneously. Relief because the uncertainty ends. Grief because the certainty is — large."

No shock.

On either side. He had known — on a level beneath knowledge, in the substrate of intuition where data accumulated into feeling without ever passing through the checkpoint of conscious analysis. And I had known he knew. The way you know someone is watching from the corner of your eye — not confirmed, not verified, but known. For a long time, at least. Maybe earlier. Maybe always.

I nodded.

The nod was sufficient. It contained everything that words would have diluted — acknowledgment, acceptance, the communication of two people who had arrived at the same truth from different directions and were meeting at the point of convergence without either of them needing to narrate the journey.

The leaves rustled. A breeze — actual breeze, not reality-warped wind, genuine atmospheric motion caused by pressure differential and solar heating and the patient physics of air. The sound was the sound of leaves in wind and nothing else.

What he didn't say: Why he stayed.

He didn't say it because it didn't need saying, because the saying would have been smaller than the fact, because some truths are best expressed through their continued demonstration rather than their articulation. He stayed because he had no other option he wanted. Not no other option — no other option he WANTED. The distinction was everything. The distinction was Xu Ran.

A man who could have walked away at any point — who had legs and a mind and the competence of a scholar who could survive alone in any terrain — and who chose, each morning, each step, each day, to walk three steps behind her and now beside her, into the mountains, toward the thing she needed to do, which was also the thing that might end everything.

He stayed because staying was his answer.

The leaves rustled.

"The blossoms are early," I said.

"You mentioned that," he said.

"You mentioned that."

Almost a smile. His. Mine. The shared, micro-expression of two people who had been traveling together long enough that their humor had synchronized, whose callbacks and references had become a private language that no one else would find funny or even comprehensible.

We sat under the tree that was older than him and younger than me, and the silence was not silence but communication, and the breeze moved the leaves and the leaves made sounds and the sounds were enough.

The fox-spirit appeared from wherever it had been investigating. Sat near us. The triangle — the three-point arrangement of woman, man, fox that constituted whatever we were. Not a party. Not a family. Something without a name that was no less real for being unnamed.

After a while, we packed. Continued. The path climbed.

He walked beside me.
