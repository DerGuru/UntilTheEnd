The thought split.

It happened without warning — without the warning-before-the-warning that the headaches usually provided, without the defensive response that usually preceded something happening inside. It happened in the grey space between dawn and full morning, in the minutes when the fire was embers and Xu Ran was sleeping and the destroyed forest surrounding them was acquiring the daylight clarity that made devastation look: precise.

The thought split.

One part was thinking about leaving. The calculation: he was injured. I was dangerous. Being near anyone was lethal. The pattern demanded I walk away from every living person and keep walking until the distance was: maximum. Infinite. The only solution.

And then:

*Nicht jetzt.*

Two words. Arriving from a place that was not the functional-calculation place. Arriving from: somewhere else. Inside. Deeper. The way the warmth during the poison experiment had arrived from below the qi, below the meridians, below the entire cultivated structure — the words arrived from below the thought.

*Nicht jetzt.*

Not never. Not the refusal to consider. *Not now.* The temporal qualification that implied: later, perhaps. But not now. Now there was a fire to tend and a man to monitor and a morning to survive.

I heard it. Or felt it. Or — the distinction was unclear, because the words were not external and not exactly internal. They occupied a space that was: between. Between thought and perception. Between my voice and something else's voice. Between the part of me that calculated departure and the part of me that —

That what?

I did not know. I sat with the two words and the not-knowing and the quality of hearing something that was both entirely mine and entirely not mine.

"Still me," I said to the destroyed forest. My voice sounded the same. That proved nothing, but it was something.

The words were familiar. The voice — if it was a voice — was familiar. Not foreign. Not invasive. Familiar the way a room you've always lived in is familiar: you stop noticing it because the noticing was absorbed into the being.

It had always been there.

That was the disturbing part. Not the split. Not the two-ness. The always. The realization that the voice — the second voice, the *Nicht jetzt* voice — had been present the entire time. I had not heard it because I had not been listening. Because listening required the quiet. The kind that came from sitting beside a fire with someone who couldn’t speak.

It was not a parasite. Not an intruder. Not whatever lived inside speaking. It was: me. Another me. Or a deeper me. Or the me that existed below the me that thought and analyzed and calculated departure.

The me that said: not yet.

I sat with it. The split. The two-ness. The presence of someone inside me who had an opinion about timing. The presence was: not threatening. That was the thing that mattered. The headaches were threatening. The erasure was threatening. The shockwave was threatening. The voice was: not. The voice was the gentle refusal to leave. The two-word intervention that said: stay.

Not because staying was safe. Not because he needed me. Because — and this was the quality I could not articulate, that existed in the sense rather than the thought — because leaving was not the next step. Something else was the next step. And the voice knew what it was even if I did not.

I did not tell Xu Ran.

When he woke — which would be soon, the breathing indicated he would wake soon — I would not describe the voice. I would not explain the split. This was between me and the deeper me. The arrangement that was forming: the public investigation (the notebook, the patterns, the observable phenomena) and the private investigation (the voice, the feeling, the thing-below-the-thought).

Two investigations. Two investigators. One body.

*Nicht jetzt.*

The words did not repeat. They did not explain themselves. They sat in the space where they had arrived and they were: sufficient. Two words containing the complete instruction. Not yet. Stay. The next step is here, not there.

I tended the fire. I checked his bandage. I waited for him to wake.

The voice did not speak again. It did not need to. The instruction was delivered. The recipient had heard it. The arrangement was: established.

Outside, the morning progressed — light increasing, temperature rising, the sounds of a forest adjusting to what the shockwave had done. Birds — not the warbler, other birds, the opportunistic species that arrived when habitat was suddenly altered — began to explore the downed trees. Life, adjusting. The resilience that living things demonstrated when their world was broken.

The fire burned. The man breathed. The voice waited.

I was not alone in my own body. I had never been alone in my own body. I was only now learning to hear the other tenant.
