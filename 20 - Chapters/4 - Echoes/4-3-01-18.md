Rain.

The kind the foothills produced in this season — not the vertical downpour of summer storms or the horizontal driving of winter but the continuous, low-pressure drizzle that existed as a state rather than an event. The air was rain. The sky was rain. The terrain was the place where rain accumulated in puddles and channels and the sodden quality that made every step heavier than the last.

Xu Ran was wet.

His pack: darkened with moisture. His hair: plastered. His outer robe: the heavy cling of saturated fabric. He walked with the resigned efficiency of someone who had accepted wetness as a condition of existence. Their acceptance did not prevent the low, continuous muttering.

He cursed the rain. He cursed the path. He cursed the quality of mountain clay that turned everything into a surface designed to reject footwear. He cursed with the methodical persistence that characterized everything he did — not explosively but systematically, the way a scholar might annotate a text he disapproved of.

His inventory of grievances was impressive. Allegedly the clay was a personal vendetta. The rain was biased. His left boot had betrayed him.

I almost said something. I didn't. But almost.

I was dry.

Not from effort. Not from technique. Not from the conscious deployment of any method that prevented water from reaching my body. Dry the way a stone at the bottom of a river was smooth — not because the stone chose smoothness but because the conditions had shaped it. My qi — vast, autonomous, operating without my direction — deflected rain. The droplets reached the three-pace radius and curved. Not visibly. Not dramatically. They simply arrived dry.

Xu Ran noticed. He had been watching the rain's behavior near me for two days — the observation that characterized his attention, the detection of phenomena that most observers would dismiss.

"It bends around you," he said, between curses.

"Hm."

"The rain. It bends. Like — " He searched for the comparison. "Like light around a dense object. You're not wet."

"Hm."

"I'm soaked."

"I can see that."

The exchange was four words. Three and one. The minimal dialogue that constituted our communication — his observations, my syllables, the space between them filled with rain and path and ten paces.

The path existed because Xu Ran chose it. Not I — I walked the direction that was in front of me, the direction that the body selected without the input of the mind, the default trajectory that produced movement without destination. Xu Ran adjusted the trajectory. "Left," he would say. Or: "There's a bridge that way." And I would go left, or toward the bridge, because going left was identical to going right in the absence of preference and his direction was as valid as any other direction.

He gave direction. I followed direction. Not because I obeyed — because direction had ceased to be a category I generated. He was the compass. I was the feet.

We walked through the rain for hours. Through terrain that was terrain and foothills that were foothills and the geography that separated the mountain forest from the lowland plains. We encountered the geography by passing through it, noting its features without caring about its design.

This was not adventure.

This was not the wanderschaft of curiosity — not the discovery, not the engagement with the world that characterized a traveler who wanted to be somewhere she hadn't been. This was the wanderschaft of a body that moved because movement was the alternative to stillness and a companion who followed because following was his project.

Two people walking through rain. One dry. One cursing.

At nightfall, he made camp. The standard procedure: fire (attempted, rain-thwarted, eventually achieved with the stubbornness that Xu Ran brought to all tasks), food (cooked with difficulty, the ginger less fragrant in the humidity), notebook (protected from rain inside his robe, opened carefully, written in with the miniature letters that were ink-marks-against-forgetting).

I sat. Six paces. The distance that had become the arrangement during cooking — the fire-proximity, the food-proximity, the being-near-without-being-in. The rain bent around me and did not bend around him. I had stopped finding cosmic editorial comments meaningful several millennia ago.

He ate. I did not eat. He wrote. I did not write.

"Day twenty-eight," he said, closing the notebook. "You've spoken eleven words today. New record."

He was counting. Of course he was counting. The words were data points and the data points were the trend line and the trend line was ascending — from zero in week one to fragments in week two to sentences in week three to eleven words on day twenty-eight. The trend was his evidence. The evidence was his reason. The reason was his being here.

I did not tell him that eleven was, by certain historical standards, a deluge.

The rain continued. The fire hissed. He curled onto his side, protecting the notebook with his body, and slept.

I sat. Dry. In rain that was everywhere except near me.

The world was grey. Had been grey since the departure, would be grey for the foreseeable continuation, would be grey until grey changed to something else and the something else was not visible from this position and this position was the only position available.

Grey was the color of functioning without living. I knew this the way I knew the rain bent around me — not from learning but from the accumulated evidence of thousands of years of grey periods, of centuries where the body walked and the mind observed and the heart beat and the combination produced: existence. Not life. Existence.

I had done this before. I would do it again. The repetition was the cruelest part — not the grey itself, but knowing that the grey had an expiration date, and that it would return regardless. Immortality had many structural disadvantages. The foreknowledge of recurrence was the one no one mentioned.

Two people in the rain. One counting words. One producing them.

Morning would come. We would walk. He would curse. I would be dry. The arrangement would hold until the arrangement changed and the change was — not yet.

Not yet.
