The path existed because paths existed: the worn lines that animals and water and the persistent pressure of footsteps carved into terrain over time. This one ran east through diminishing forest toward lower ground, toward the kind of open landscape that mountains produced when they tired of being mountains.

I walked. Behind me: ten paces. Behind the ten paces: Xu Ran.

We had been walking for three days since the departure. Or four. The number was his department, the responsibility that his notebook assumed and that I had silently ceded because the number-tracking required effort I did not have.

The dynamic had stabilized. Not settled — stabilized. The equilibrium that two objects in motion achieved when their velocities matched and their distance remained constant — a constant that was the agreement neither party had articulated. I walked. He followed. The ten paces held.

He cooked at nightfall. I sat six paces from the fire. The ginger smell reached me and I did not eat and he did not offer and the not-offering was the arrangement and the arrangement was the respect that existed between someone who had stopped performing and someone who had stopped expecting.

"You're staring," he said, on the second evening.

"I'm evaluating."

"You said that last time."

"The evaluation is ongoing."

He looked up from the pot. The glance of someone processing information that was unexpected. Not the words themselves but the quantity. Four words. The longest voluntary response since his arrival.

He returned his attention to the pot. He did not smile. Xu Ran, I was learning, did not smile in the conventional sense. His face performed a different operation, a compression of features that looked like concentration but that occupied the same functional category as amusement. The compression happened. He stirred.

"Your technique is wasteful," I said.

This was not evaluating. This was judgment. A qualitative assessment regarding his cooking methodology, and the methodology was, objectively, from the perspective of someone who had observed cooking across civilizations, wasteful. He used too much water. The ginger was cut too thick. The heat was distributed unevenly because the stone arrangement maximized stability rather than thermal efficiency.

"My technique," he said, with the compression-face, "keeps me alive."

"Barely."

He stopped stirring. The compression-face intensified. He looked at me across six paces of gradient — across the transition zone where life became death became life — and the looking was the assessment of someone recalibrating. The subject had offered criticism. The subject had engaged.

He wrote something. One line. Then resumed stirring.

We walked. Through the foothills. Through the transition between mountain forest and lowland vegetation, the ecological shift that altitude produced: gradual, unremarkable, the same shift I had observed in this region approximately twelve times over the centuries.

Except: the pair of us. The two of us. Two shapes where there had been one. The single body had been a point — a location, a source of death-radius with no relational component. The pair was a line. A vector with magnitude and direction. A thing that pointed somewhere even if the somewhere was undetermined.

The path narrowed on the fourth morning. Forest pressed in, denser, older, the kind of growth that indicated a region not recently traversed by humans. The canopy closed. The light diminished.

Xu Ran shortened the distance. Not deliberately. The path forced it. The narrowing produced proximity that the standard terrain did not. Eight paces. Seven.

At seven paces, the grass between us yellowed. The transition zone had compressed. He was inside the outer gradient.

"Back up," I said.

"The path doesn't let me."

"Then walk slower."

"Then I lose you."

The logic was accurate. The path was narrow and the narrowness forced proximity, the proximity compressed the gradient, and both forced the choice: distance or connection.

He did not back up. He adjusted, angling to the side, finding the path's margin, the extra centimeters that one body-width of offset provided. Seven and a half paces. The grass: pale yellow. Not brown. Not dead. Stressed but surviving.

His left knee popped when he shifted. The broken core's cost: joints wearing faster than they should, the compensation visible in the way he favored one side.

We emerged from the dense growth into a clearing. The kind that ridgelines produced: a break in the canopy, a view. The lowlands spread below. Rolling. Green. The patchwork of cultivated land and wild land that human settlement produced on fertile terrain.

Ahead: distance. Days of travel. Weeks.

"If you want to come," I said, "keep up."

The sentence was the first complete instruction I had issued since the departure. Not a request. Not an invitation. An instruction — the speech-act that incorporated authority and direction and assumed the listener's compliance. Keep up. Or don't. The verb is yours.

"Where are we going?" he asked.

I walked.

He followed.

The clearing shrank behind us. The path ahead descended into the lowlands, into the terrain that would produce the encounters and the distances and the time that the next section of existence required. Behind us: the forest. The death-circles. The hut and the clearing and the oak root and the weeks of standing and the weeks of silence and the slow, measurable thaw.

Ahead: the lowlands. Two figures descending. One ahead. One behind. Between them: ten paces restored, the gradient normalized, the distance that coexistence required between a desert that breathed and a scholar who feared silence.

The morning air carried the smell of the lowlands: wet earth, grass, the humidity that indicated rivers and proximity of the kind of world that contained other people and other problems.

The path descended. We descended with it. The dynamic of the next months — the years — the next chapter of whatever this existence was: established. One ahead. One behind. Ten paces. Moving.

Moving.

That was the beginning. I didn't know of what yet.
