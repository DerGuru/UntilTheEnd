The destroyed clearing was behind us by three days and seventeen rest-stops when I turned back.

Not physically. Physically we continued forward — the slow, rib-governed pace that Xu Ran's healing imposed on the trajectory. Physically the clearing receded, step by careful step, into the distance that the walking produced.

I turned back in my attention. In the direction that attention adopted when the present was stable enough to release the mind toward the past. The present was stable: walk, pause, eat, walk, sleep, walk. The repetition had produced the stability. And the stability had released the attention. And the attention went: back.

To the destroyed clearing. To the circle of snapped trees and fissured ground. To the place where the shockwave had detonated from my body and the devastation had radiated outward and the man who now limped beside me had been crumpled like paper by the force I produced.

I stopped walking.

Xu Ran stopped. Three paces ahead. He turned — carefully, the rotation limited by the ribs. He looked at me.

"I want to go back," I said.

He said nothing. The silence that was his method of inviting elaboration without demanding it.

"Not to the clearing. To where it started."

He waited.

"The origin." I touched my sternum. Here. Inside. The place where the thing-below-qi resided, where the shockwave was manufactured. "I need to go inward."

He understood. I saw the understanding arrive — the facial shift from waiting to comprehension. He understood what I meant. Not physical return. Not geographical. The inward direction. The *Rein* that had been the compass bearing since the cliff.

But before the inward turn, I needed the outward reckoning.

"The clearing," I said. "I want to see it one more time."

We went back. The three days' walking became five — his pace had not improved, the ribs healing at the mortal speed that mortal bodies demanded. We walked back through the forest, through the path we had already taken, through the retracing that constituted: return.

The clearing was unchanged. The destruction was: persistent. The snapped trees. The fissured ground. The circle — thirty meters, precise, the radius of my protection's overflow. Nothing had grown. The devastation was fresh enough to hold its shape.

I stood at the center. Where I had stood when I drank the poison. Where the shockwave had originated. The exact spot.

I looked at it.

The fallen trees radiated outward from my position like the petals of a flower that had been pressed flat. The fissures in the ground followed the same radial pattern. Everything pointed away from where I stood. Everything said: this is where the force originated. This is where the center was.

I was the center.

Wind moved through the downed trees. The sound of air passing through forest that was no longer standing — lower than the canopy-wind, more intimate, the whisper of air through snapped branches and cracked trunks. The sound of aftermath.

The smell of ash was present. Three days old. Wood-ash and charred earth.

The smell triggered it.

Ash. The smell of ash. The sensory channel opening — the Andock-Regel engaging, the connection between present sensation and past experience that produced: recall.

Wei had said it once. In a morning that smelled like this — like ash, like the aftermath of something that had burned. A campfire. A cooking fire. The domestic context that Wei inhabited when he was not dying.

He had said: "If you don't know where to go, just go."

You asked me once about the phrase. *Just go.* I told you it was Wei's. You wrote it down in a hand smaller than usual.

The memory was short. Four sentences. The image: Wei's back. He was walking ahead of me. The morning was grey. He did not look back when he said it, because the saying was not for my approval — the saying was: a principle. A Wei directive that governed ambiguity: if you don't know, go. If you're uncertain, move. If the destination is unclear, the motion is still valid.

If you don't know where to go, just go.

So I went. He had been right. He was always right, the dead boy with the simple principles and the walking ahead of me into mornings that smelled like ash.

I turned away from the clearing. The looking was done. The reckoning was complete. Not closed — complete. I had seen what I had done. I had stood at the center of my own destructive radius. I had understood the geography of my danger.

And then I had remembered the directive. The Wei-directive. The four-sentence compass.

Just go.

The clearing stayed behind. The trees stayed down. The fissures stayed open. The circle of my destruction stayed exactly as I had made it — a monument to the thing inside me that protected me at any cost.

I did not look back a second time. Looking once was: enough.

Xu Ran fell in behind me. Three paces. His ribs. His limp. His breathing careful and shallow and measured. He followed.

And we went.
