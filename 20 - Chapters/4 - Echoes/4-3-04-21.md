The spirit-beasts came at dawn. The bandits came twenty minutes later. The combination was coincidence or design or the universe being occasionally efficient in its distribution of problems.

Two spirit-beasts. Different species — one the cat-type that operated in forested terrain, the size of a large dog, qi-armored, fast. The other: something bovine, heavier, slower, the kind that charged and that used mass as its primary weapon. Neither was dangerous. Not to me. Not in the category of things that constituted danger on the scale that my capabilities measured danger.

I yawned.

Not performatively — genuinely. The involuntary reflex the body produced when a stimulus was insufficient. The spirit-beasts were insufficient. They were math problems I had solved before the math had a name.

The cat-type moved first. Fast — the acceleration of a predator whose muscles were optimized for the initial burst. It covered the distance in the time it took the thought *it's-fast* to form and dissolve. Fast for what it was. Slow for what I was.

I stepped aside. Less than a body's width of lateral movement, using the beast's own momentum as the mechanism of its failure. It passed me. Its claws found the space I had occupied. The space was empty.

The bovine charged. Direct. The linear application of mass-times-velocity that required no subtlety and that relied on the assumption that the target would be where the target was when the charge began. I was not where I was when the charge began. The bovine's horn cut air. The air was cooperative.

I dealt with both in the interval that Xu Ran later described as "less than I could track." Which was his way of saying: fast enough that his perception — human-speed, cultivator-enhanced but still fundamentally human-speed — lost the sequence.

The bandits arrived as the beasts were falling. Four of them. Armed — swords, one spear, the armament of opportunistic predators at the margins of civilization. Perhaps they'd been tracking the beasts. Perhaps us. Perhaps just following the scent of violence.

They saw the beasts — falling, unconscious, the limpness of qi-channel shutdown applied with the efficiency of someone who had been doing this for longer than their species had been cultivating.

They reassessed.

The reassessment took approximately the same duration as the fight — a breath, maybe two. The calculation that engaging the person who had just incapacitated two spirit-beasts in a fraction of a second was not favorable.

Two of them ran. Two of them — the kind of stupid that survival pressures had not yet eliminated — advanced.

I yawned again.

The first one reached me and I let him.

He swung. A sword — functional, maintained, the weapon of someone who used it regularly and cared about it the way professionals cared about their tools. Horizontal arc. Standard. The kind of attack that worked against targets unable to avoid it.

I could have avoided it. The way I had avoided the cat-type, the way I had avoided the bovine, the way I avoided everything that came at me with the casual ease of a body that had been doing this for millennia. I could have stepped aside and the sword would have found air and the bandit would have found the ground.

I didn't.

The sword caught my sleeve. Left arm. Upper. The fabric tore — the sound of woven material separating under a sharpened edge. The blade continued through the fabric and into flesh. My flesh.

Pain.

The pain was: present. Clear. The frequency that physical damage produced in a nervous system receiving signals without filtering them. The blade entered my arm and the nerves fired and the firing was pain and the pain was the first thing in weeks that was completely, undeniably, unambiguously real.

I breathed it in. Literally. The warm scent of my own blood — mineral, old, the scent that predated humanity.

Blood. My blood. The color and viscosity of blood that had been inside me and was now outside and the outside was warm and wet on my arm and the warmth was real.

The bandit saw the blood. His face — for one breath — showed the expression of someone who believed they had succeeded, who believed the blood was the evidence of mortality.

Then it healed.

Not instantly — with a delay. A one-second delay during which the wound was open and the blood was flowing and the pain was present and the delay was: mine. I held it. One second. Not consciously — the way one held a breath, the moment of suspension between intake and release.

One second of pain. Then the flesh closed. The skin sealed.

The bandit's expression changed. The transition from triumph to a category that did not have a standard name but occupied the space between disbelief and religious terror.

I ended him. His capacity to fight, not his life — the wrist technique from the earlier encounter. He screamed. He fell. The second bandit was already running.

I stood. In the clearing. Two beasts unconscious. Two bandits disabled. Sleeve: torn. Blood: drying. Pain: fading.

The fading was the loss. The pain had been present and now it was leaving and the leaving was the subtraction I had tried to delay with the one-second pause. The pain was the only thing that had been completely real.

Gone.

I would learn, eventually, that this was a pattern. Pain as the only frequency clear enough to reach me. But eventually was later, and later required more pain, and more pain required more bandits or more stupidity or both.

Xu Ran stood at the clearing's edge. Notebook open. His face was pale — the pale of someone whose data had expanded beyond his framework for the third time this week.

"You did that on purpose," he said.

Not a question. Not an accusation. The observation of someone who had watched the sequence — the avoiding, the not-avoiding, the letting-through, the delay, the healing — and who had understood its internal logic: she chose to be hurt.

"Be quiet," I said.

He wrote it down.
