The cultivators came from the east.

Three of them. Early morning. The hour when mist still clung to the lower forest and visibility dropped to forty paces — the kind of tactical condition cultivators exploited.

Xu Ran felt them first. His broken core — the quarter-tone-flat resonance, the damaged receiver — still detected cultivation signatures, the same way a cracked bell still rang. He woke with the immediacy of someone whose alertness was calibrated to threat.

"Three," he said. "Southeast. Moving formation."

A formation. The arrangement that indicated intent. Not wanderers. People who had calculated angles and spacing and discussed approach vectors. People who had decided I was worth the formation.

Something happened.

Not a thought — thoughts required the deliberate processing that the disconnection impaired. Not a decision — decisions required will. Something below both. The thing that had moved the body toward the wolf-beast in the clearing. The thing that operated in the layer beneath wanting. The involuntary impulse that was not fight and not flight but something third.

Search.

I turned toward them.

Not away. Toward. The reorientation of a body that had been facing north and that now faced southeast, toward the mist, toward the three cultivation signatures approaching in their calculated formation.

Halfway through the turn, I noticed what I was doing. The noticing was the crack — a splinter of recognition that this was not reflex. This was choice. The disconnection had not produced this. Something else had.

Xu Ran saw me turn. His expression — I did not look at it. I looked at the mist. At the space between the trees where the three signatures were resolving from abstraction into presence.

"What are you doing?"

The question arrived from behind me, from ten paces.

"Mich aufwärmen."

I walked toward them.

The forest opened as I moved — not physically, but in the way forests opened when one stopped caring about branches and roots and obstacles. The body moved and the direction was toward.

They emerged from the mist at twenty paces. Three cultivators. Sect uniforms — the coloring and cut that indicated the same organization that had sent scouts to the settlement, the same organization that existed in my history as: enemy.

They saw me. The lead cultivator — middle-aged, the build of a combat specialist, decades of this — registered my approach with visible surprise. Not the approach but the direction. They had expected to find me. They had not expected me to find them.

I walked toward them the way you walk toward someone you've been expecting. My shoulders dropped — not submission. Relief. Setting down something heavy I'd been carrying too long.

The lead cultivator drew his weapon. A sword. Standard issue, mid-level. He drew it with the fluidity of someone who had drawn it many times.

The other two flanked. Standard formation — spacing that maximized coverage while minimizing mutual interference.

Two breaths.

The first breath: I closed the distance. Not running — accelerating. Fifteen paces in the interval between one heartbeat and the next.

The lead cultivator's sword came up. The correct response. The response that his training produced and that his training was designed to produce. The sword was between us and the between-us was the correct tactical position for a sword.

I went through it.

Through the defense. Through the guard. Through the martial architecture that decades of training had installed. My hand on his wrist. Twist.

*Knack.*

Short, dry, like a branch. The wrist went. The sword went. He made a sound — the involuntary vocalization that pain produced.

The second cultivator: already moving. The flanking attack from the left — coordinated, rehearsed. My attention was not directional. It was the passive awareness of a body that had been doing this for longer than their sect had existed.

One finger. On his lower dantian. The knot where the meridians met. The weak point. I knew it the way I knew the smoke smelled like damp wood. Intimately. From repetition over millennia. The finger pressed. The qi behind it pressed.

A hiss — quiet, like air escaping something sealed. The dantian buckled. Not shattered, compressed. Blocked.

He collapsed. Not from pain — from the sudden absence of qi-flow.

The third: running. Not fighting — running. The correct assessment. Two allies down in less time than it took to identify the threat. The third cultivator — younger, recent promotion to field operations — ran.

I let him.

Not from mercy. From the exhaustion of engagement — the stimulus had been received, the receipt was complete.

I stood over two cultivators. One: clutching his wrist, the grip that protected a joint that no longer functioned. The other: on the ground, breathing, conscious, unable to access his cultivation. Both: alive.

Alive was not mercy. Killing required an additional action and additional actions required additional motivation.

The forest was quiet. The mist thinning.

I turned back. Toward camp. Toward the embers and the researcher with the notebook.

The nothing came back. Filled the space the stimulus had left. Completely. The fight was over. The silence returned.

Nothing had changed. Three people had been broken and nothing had changed. The noise had happened and it was gone and the searching — the going-toward, the turning to greet danger like a familiar — was the symptom of the absence of a solution. The symptom was all I had.

Xu Ran stood at the camp's edge. Notebook open. He had watched the entire thing from ten paces.

He wrote.

His hand was steady. His expression was the expression of someone whose understanding of the subject had just expanded by a factor he had not anticipated. He wrote three pages.

He did not ask if I was alright.

He already knew the answer.
