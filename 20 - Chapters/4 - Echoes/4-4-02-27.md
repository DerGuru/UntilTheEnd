I stepped forward.

Not a jump — a step. The shift of weight from one foot to the other. A step. Except beneath the step was nothing.

Let's see.

The words were internal. Neither farewell nor statement. An experiment's hypothesis in two syllables: let's see what happens.

Air.

The first second was the second in which the body understood that it was no longer supported. No ground. No surface. The whole-body alarm of falling fired, vestibular to muscular, the cascade immediate.

The alarm was vestigial. A reflex from a body that had forgotten it couldn't die. Firing into nothing.

One.

The count was automatic. The body counted. It had been counting things for millennia; counting was what it did without other directives. One. The first second.

The cliff wall: grey. Rushing upward, or I was rushing downward. Sedimentary rock exposed to weather for geological time. Layers. Striations. The autobiography of a mountain, readable to anyone falling past at terminal velocity.

Two.

Wind. Vertical wind. The air resistance of a falling body against my face, against my body. Pressure increasing with velocity, producing the roar that falling things produced.

My robes flattened against me. Loose fabric pressed tight by descent. The wind's work was the only force acting on me aside from gravity.

Three.

The sky above: receding. Blue. High-altitude blue. Getting farther away. The thing I was leaving. The thing I was approaching was grey and final and patient.

Four.

I observed.

This was the difference. Previous times — the falls, the impacts, the incidents across millennia where terminal velocities met terminal surfaces — had been experienced passively. The body fell. The body stopped. The body survived. The process was opaque.

This time I watched. Observation directed inward. At the landscape where the thing that kept me alive operated.

Five.

The rock below: larger. Proportions shifting. The boulders that had been pebble-sized from the top were now fist-sized. Lower third. Terminal velocity achieved. Impact imminent.

Six.

I watched inside.

The qi: present. The signature of the autonomous cycling that operated without my direction. The qi was there, in its channels, in its circulation. But it was not doing anything. Cycling. Maintaining. Present the way the heart was present — functioning, continuous, not responding to the crisis.

Something else.

Below the qi. Below the channels. Below the framework that cultivation theory described. Something at the foundation: not qi, not body, not mind, but the thing all of those rested on. The substrate.

Seven.

The substrate stirred.

I was watching this time. Full attention. Directed observation. I was here for this.

The substrate stirred the way a sleeping animal stirred when a noise reached it. Pre-waking. The preparatory movement before the eyes opened.

The stirring produced: warmth.

warmth from deeper. From the foundation. Energy from a source that had no category I could name.

The warmth expanded. From the center, the place cultivation theory called the core, but beneath the core. Outward. Into the channels. Along the body. Through paths that usually carried qi and now carried something older.

The rock-dust smell reached me. Three seconds from impact. Mineral and dry and ancient.

Eight.

The warmth became pressure. A hand pressing on the chest from inside, a hand made of warmth. The force increasing.

Burning.

The warmth burned. Not painfully — intensity exceeding the comfortable range. Energy on contact. Energy inside. The hand pressing on the heart, and the pressing was the intervention —

Something stopped the fall.

The stopping was a transition. The relationship between my body and the air changed. Gravity weakened. A force opposed by another force, the opposition incremental and enough.

I slowed.

One hundred meters from the ground. Slowing. Terminal velocity becoming sub-terminal. The grey rock still approaching, gentler now.

Fifty meters. The warmth in my chest: intense. The hand on my heart: pressing. Energy engaged in an operation that biology did not describe and physics did not permit.

Twenty meters. Slower. The velocity now was the velocity of a leaf.

The terminal velocity of something that had stopped being heavy.

Floating.

For two seconds — or three — I floated. Eight meters from the grey rock. Suspended. Equilibrium. Nothing moved.

I hung in air.

Then: descent. Gentle. Settling. My feet touched rock. Soles on grey stone. Ground.

I stood.

On the rock. At the bottom of eight hundred meters. Upright. Intact.

Dust on my robes. I wiped them mechanically, the gesture after contact with stone.

The silence. The silence from the top was still here. Or a different silence — the silence that came after. The silence that followed the impossible.

Then: cold.

The third marker. The warmth that had burned in my chest withdrew. Heat left and was replaced by ice.

Cold in the joints. Cold in the fingers. Cold in places cold should not reach, because this cold was internal. The price. Energy deployed; heat extracted.

I shivered.

I shivered because the body shivered — the first uncontrolled physical response in centuries. Hands. Knees. Jaw.

The trembling continued. Standing on the grey rock. At the bottom of the cliff. Alive. As always. Trembling. Not as always.

I had survived. This was not news. What was news: I had watched. I had observed the intervention: the substrate stirring, the warmth deploying, the hand pressing, the fall stopping.

I had watched how I survived.

And the how was: something inside me had decided I would not die. Something with its own judgment. Something that operated on my behalf without asking.

Something in me had decided, and the decision was: no. Not this. Not now. Not ever.

The shivering continued. The cold held.

I stood at the bottom of the cliff, shivering, and the shivering was acknowledgment: something had changed. After millennia, I had seen it.

And the thing was not me.
