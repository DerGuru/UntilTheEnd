He woke in the late afternoon.

The transition: a change in his breathing, a deeper intake immediately punished by the ribs, a sound — not a word, not a groan, somewhere between. His eyes opened. The left eye: partially obscured by the swelling from the temple laceration. The right eye: clear, focused, performing the immediate environmental survey that consciousness produced.

He saw the destroyed forest. The fallen trees. The fissured ground. The circle of devastation with the fire at its center.

He saw me.

I was sitting two paces away. His blood on my hands — dried now, gone brown. His bandage on his temple — my sleeve, stained, functional. His arm — reset, swollen, positioned against his body in the configuration that minimized pain.

He tried to sit up. The ribs. He stopped. The arrested motion of someone whose body was communicating: no.

"Don't," I said.

He lay back. His right eye tracked me. The observation that was his nature — the notation, the recording, the assessment that he performed on every input with the compulsive thoroughness that characterized: him.

His hand went to his hip. Where the notebook should have been. His notebook was gone — scattered, blown away, somewhere in the debris field that the shockwave had created.

"Notebook," he said. His voice was roughened. The respiratory obstruction from the blood had cleared but the vocal cords were affected by the dehydration and the concussion and the general systemic impact of being thrown into a tree.

"Later," I said.

He looked at me. At my hands. At the bandage. At the fire. The sequential observation of someone assembling a narrative from evidence.

"How long?" he asked.

"Overnight. It's afternoon."

He processed this. The lost time. The unconsciousness. The gap in his documentation. I watched him process it — the discomfort on his face, the discomfort of a documenter who had missed the most documentable event.

"What happened?" he asked.

"The poison was neutralized. Before it reached lethal concentration. Something in me neutralized it."

He was watching my face. Not my words — my face. Reading what the face said rather than what the mouth did.

"And then?"

"And then the neutralization released a shockwave. Qi-pressure. Approximately thirty-meter radius." I looked at the fallen trees. The evidence. "You were at ten meters."

He looked at the fallen trees. He looked at his own body. He connected the evidence. He saw the blood. He knew who put it there.

He said nothing for a long time. The fire crackled. A bird — one of the opportunistic species from the morning — called from a surviving tree at the destruction's edge.

"Was war das?" he asked.

German. He spoke German because I had spoken German. The fossil language. The language that operated at the deeper layer where the important things were said.

I looked at him. His pale face. His bloody temple. His swollen arm. His broken ribs. The evidence of what had happened. The evidence of what I was.

"Ich."

One word. One syllable. The complete answer to his question.

Me.

He stared at me. Five seconds. Ten. He stared long enough to weigh the word against everything he knew and find that it: fit. That the single word explained the shockwave and the protection and the poison's failure and the centuries of immortality and the deaths of everyone who had stood too close.

Me.

He leaned back. Slowly. The ribs. He closed his eyes. He breathed — carefully, the shallow rhythms that broken ribs imposed.

"Ich," he repeated.

Not a question. An echo. The word returning to the space between them where it would remain.

He did not ask for clarification. He did not ask for elaboration. He did not ask what *Ich* meant in the mechanical sense, what the thing inside me was, how it operated, why it existed. He asked nothing.

Because the word was: enough. The word was the complete truth compressed into its smallest possible volume. Me. I did this. I am this. The protection, the destruction, the shockwave, the centuries. Me.

He lay on the ground in the circle of wreckage. I sat two paces away. His blood on my hands. The fire burned the wood that my protection had created.

Between us: one word. Sufficient.

The silence held. Not the empty silence of my months alone. Not the one-sided silence of his early days of documentation. A different silence: the shared comprehension of two people who had arrived at the same understanding through different routes and who recognized that the understanding did not require further language.

He breathed. I waited. The fire burned. The word remained.

Ich.

You took that word home. Never returned it. Never asked for a longer one.
