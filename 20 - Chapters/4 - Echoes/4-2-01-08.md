He appeared on the fourth day after the clearing. Or the sixth. The number was irrelevant.

He stood at the edge of the forest.

Not dramatically. Not in the manner of a person making an entrance or establishing presence or performing any of the elaborate social choreography that arrivals usually involved. He stood. At the tree line. Twenty paces from where my trajectory would take me through a gap between two pines. He stood and he waited.

I registered him the way I registered the trees: as an object in the visual field. Human-shaped. Human-sized. Mid-twenties, the build of someone whose body reflected discipline rather than labor. Dark hair. Dark eyes. A pack on his back — worn, patched, the kind of deterioration that meant weeks of travel. He smelled like unwashed roads and dried sweat and something medicinal, faintly bitter.

A notebook in his left hand. Already open.

I walked.

My trajectory did not change. The gap between the pines was where the body walked and the body walked there and the human-shaped object at the edge of the forest was not an obstacle and was not a destination and was therefore irrelevant to the trajectory.

I passed him at twelve paces. Twice the radius. The grass between us — green. Safe distance. His distance, specifically — chosen with the precision of someone who had studied the death-circle and calculated its boundary.

He did not speak. Not immediately. He watched me pass with the concentrated attention of a researcher observing a phenomenon — no fear, no reverence, no pity.

I continued walking. Behind me: his footsteps. Following. The rhythm of someone matching pace at a deliberate distance — not closing the gap, not falling behind. Twelve paces. His gait slightly uneven, the left side compensating for something — an old injury, maybe, or a body that had learned to carry damage without stopping.

He followed for hours. Through forest. Through clearings. He followed with the patient endurance of someone who had decided following was the activity and who would perform it until it was complete.

Most who followed me stopped when the grass died under their feet. He appeared to find this encouraging rather than concerning.

At nightfall I stopped. In a clearing. I stood.

He sat.

Ten paces from me. Beyond the edge of the radius. The distance that said: I am near but I am not inside.

He sat on the grass and the grass under him remained green and the grass near me browned and the space between us was the gradient that measured my toxicity: brown to yellow to green.

He opened the notebook. He wrote.

I stood. Eyes on the middle distance. Not looking at him, not looking away from him. Standing.

"My name is Xu Ran."

His voice was clear. The clarity of someone who spoke to be heard, not to be acknowledged.

I said nothing.

"I've been searching for you for three months."

Three months. The information entered me the way the beetle had entered me, the way the stream had entered me — received, not processed. Three months was a unit of time. Time passed. The passing was independent of my participation.

"The withered forests were not difficult to follow."

He said this without accusation. Without judgment. A navigational method — he had followed the dead zones, the way one follows a river or a ridge. He had tracked my toxicity for li through forest, reading the dead grass and the silent birds the way a tracker read footprints.

I was not difficult to find. I was the easiest thing in the world to find, because everything I touched died and death was the most visible marker in a living landscape.

He continued writing. The pen moved in the rhythm of compulsion — not deliberate, not chosen, performed. He wrote the way I walked: because the body did it regardless.

"I'm going to sleep," he said, after a silence that lasted long enough for the stars to appear. "I'll still be here in the morning."

He said this to the clearing, or to me, or to the notebook. He said it and he curled onto his side on the green grass at the safe distance and he closed his eyes.

I stood.

Eyes open. Stars overhead. The humming in my chest: constant, low, the vibration that said alive and the alive-saying was directed at no one and the no one now included a person sleeping ten paces away on grass that remained green because ten paces was outside the radius.

His breathing: even. He slept deeply and quickly, the efficiency of a body that had learned to sleep in any condition. He slept on the ground, in the open, ten paces from something that killed grass and beetles and spiders, and he slept with the confidence of someone who had calculated the risk and accepted it. His risk assessment was either very precise or very absent. I had not yet determined which.

I did not sleep.

Morning came. He was still there. He had said he would be and he was and the being-there was a fact and the fact was registered.

He opened his eyes. He sat up. He looked at me — still standing, same position, eyes open — and he did not comment on the fact that I had not moved. He opened the notebook. He wrote.

Then he spoke.

"You don't eat."

An observation. Not a question. He had set food near me at some point during the night — rice, from a container, cold, placed six paces from me where the grass was yellow and the food was technically in the transition zone between death and life. I had not eaten it. I had not noticed it. Eating required the detection of hunger and hunger had disconnected.

"You don't sleep."

He was cataloguing me. The way a scholar catalogued a specimen. Methodical. Detached. Without warmth and without coldness — something between. Professional attention.

"And you don't leave," he said. "I leave when I understand. Not before."

He wrote.

I stood.

The grass around me: dead. The grass around him: alive. Between us: the gradient. The ten paces of transition from what I was to what the world was. He occupied the living side. I occupied the other.

He was still there.
