I tried to find it again.

The substrate. The warmth. The sensation that the cliff had provided — the stirring below the qi, the energy from the foundation, the hand pressing on the heart from inside. I stood at the crater's center, on the basalt, on the cold stone, and I closed my eyes and I looked inward.

Looked was the wrong word. The searching was tactile — the mind directed toward the body's interior. I searched for the substrate the way one searched for a sound heard in another room: by quieting everything else and listening.

The qi: present. Cycling. The autonomous humming that constituted the second breathing, the constant background process that the substrate operated through my channels. The qi was there. The qi was always there. The qi was not what I was looking for.

Below the qi. Where the cliff had shown me. Below the channels, below the architecture that cultivation built. I pushed my attention deeper — not physically, not with force, but with concentration. Descending through the layers the way a diver descended through water: each meter deeper producing greater resistance.

Deeper. Past the qi infrastructure. Past the core. Past the energetic structures that millennia of cultivation had built. Into the space where the substrate lived.

I found the boundary.

Not a wall — a threshold. The sensation of attention encountering something that was not part of the same architecture. The boundary felt like the space between wakefulness and sleep — not a surface but a transition.

I pushed.

The substrate responded.

Not the way the cliff had provoked it. The crater response was: no.

No. A locked door. The thing being sought did not want to be found.

*Not yet*, something said. Not my voice. Not a voice at all. The wordless impression that doors made when they were not going to open.

I pushed harder.

The qi spiked. Not gradually. Instantly — from baseline to maximum. The qi spiked and the spiking was not from me.

Trees.

The trees at the crater's rim — twenty meters from where I stood — snapped. Not fell — snapped. Trunk-level fractures. Simultaneous. The sound — the cracking, the splintering — was enormous. It filled the crater. It echoed off the walls.

The ground cracked. Surface fractures radiating outward from where I stood. Twenty meters. Twenty-five.

Dust rising. Grey. Dense.

Then: silence.

I stood. In the center. In the damage. The trees: broken. The ground: cracked. The dust: settling. A qi-eruption because I had pushed on a door that did not want to be opened and the door had pushed back.

My breathing was heavy. Rapid heartbeat. My body's own internal forces had just demonstrated they could break trees at twenty meters.

Something in me had said: do not look here. And the not-looking-here was enforced with destruction.

A warning.

Xu Ran. At the rim — or where the rim had been before the trees broke. He was on the ground. Not hurt — thrown. The shockwave had knocked him backward.

He sat up. His face: the pale of revised understanding.

"What—" He stopped. "What was that?"

I looked at my hands. My hands were normal. My hands had not moved.

"I don't know," I said.

He reached for his notebook. His hands were shaking. He wrote what he had seen. Trees. Ground. Dust.

"Don't do that again," he said.

He said this without looking up.

"I wasn't trying to," I said.

"Which part?"

"Any of it."

He looked up. Assessed. Concluded: she was not lying.

He closed the notebook. He sat among the broken trees. I stood in the crater. Between us: dust and silence and the evidence.

Something had happened at the crater's rim that he did not tell me about. Something I would learn much later, from a detail in his notebook. He had been approached. He had said no.

In the weeks that followed, his handwriting became slightly less steady. His head would turn, occasionally, to check the path behind us. His notebook would be held closer — against the chest, inside the robe.

I would notice these things. I would not connect them.

The crater settled. The dust cleared. The trees remained broken.

We left.
