The cold was the trigger. In the joints. In the deep-tissue places the substrate's withdrawal had left depleted. The cold connected and the connection produced:

Wei.

Uncontrolled. Unbidden. The memory arrived the way memories arrived when the trigger was bodily. Fully formed, sensory-complete, installed in the perception as if it were happening now.

Wei, on a night. Cold. The mountain settlement in the wet season, the kind that entered buildings through wall-gaps and compressed the living space into the area nearest the fire and made the fire itself seem insufficient. The smell of pine-smoke and wet stone.

He had asked a question.

This was characteristic. Wei asked questions the way other children performed tasks: by assignment. He had decided that tonight was a question-night and the question was the kind that fourteen-year-old boys who had been trained by immortals asked when they had accumulated enough observation to formulate something that exceeded their apparent capacity.

"What was the worst thing that ever happened to you?"

His voice. Not quite a child's anymore, not yet a man's. The in-between. The voice that had been changing for months. I remembered the voice because the voice was the anchor.

I had considered the question. The worst thing. The superlative that required the thing to exceed all other things in its category.

I had responded.

"Waking up tomorrow."

Three words. I had a habit of making large truths portable.

He laughed.

The laugh carried no amusement. He had expected something grand — an event, a battle, a named historical trauma — and received instead a domestic observation. The mismatch was the humor.

I didn't.

The memory closed. The cold in the joints warmed. The sensory anchor released.

I was climbing. The cliff wall. Grey stone, sedimentary, the geology I had studied during the descent now viewed from the reversed perspective. The same grey I had fallen past. My hands on the rock. My feet finding purchase. Handholds that centuries of weather had carved into the face. The stone was cold under my fingers. The same cold as the memory. The memory was Wei, and Wei was gone.

Waking up tomorrow. The worst thing.

And now — at the bottom of an eight-hundred-meter cliff that I had survived because something inside me had decided I would survive — now the answer had a different meaning.

The facts had not changed. Waking up tomorrow was still the worst thing. The daily confirmation of un-dying. The structural perpetuity that the substrate maintained regardless of my participation. Still the worst.

But the relationship to the worst thing had changed.

Before the cliff: waking up tomorrow was the worst thing, a burden, the passive load that existence placed on the shoulders that carried it. Before the cliff: I woke up because I could not not wake up. The waking was compulsory. The waking was structural.

After the cliff: waking up tomorrow was still the worst thing. But the worst thing was now the thing I chose to investigate rather than the thing I chose to endure.

The difference was: agency.

The agency was not free, not liberation from what the substrate imposed. I would still wake up. The un-dying would continue. But the consciousness that woke up — the Yun that opened her eyes to the next morning — now had a project. A question.

What am I.

The question did not make the worst thing less worst. The question made the worst thing purposeful. And purpose was what the grey weeks had lacked. Not healed. Transformed. The way a wound that healed wrong was transformed by breaking it again and setting it correctly — the pain was still pain but the direction of the healing was different.

I climbed. The cliff provided handholds. My body used them.

Wei had laughed. The laugh lived in the memory. The memory lived in me. Wei's laugh in me was a kind of pain the cliff-shift could not address, because the cliff-shift concerned what-I-was, not why-he-died. The two questions were related but not identical.

But one answer was more than zero answers.

And zero was what I had had in the forest.

Now I had one.

One was enough.

The cliff's top was approaching. Eight hundred meters of stone that the body traversed without fatigue. The top was up and up was where Xu Ran was and Xu Ran was the thing that I was climbing toward not because I wanted him but because above was the direction and going required: starting.

My hands reached the edge. The same edge that my toes had extended past. The same edge that I had stepped off with let's see as my only thought.

I pulled myself up.

Standing. At the top. The wind had resumed. The world was back. Sound was back — insects, birds, the distant movement of things that moved.

Xu Ran was sitting three paces from the edge. Cross-legged. Notebook open. The brush in his hand, moving. Disciplined, controlled. The posture of someone who had decided that documentation was the appropriate response to horror.

He looked up.

"Forty-seven minutes," he said. "From impact to the base. Twelve minutes stationary. Thirty-eight minutes climbing. The ascent rate suggests no significant structural damage."

"You timed it."

"I document." He closed the notebook. Opened it again. "The fall was eight hundred and twelve meters. You struck a ledge at approximately four hundred. The sound was —" He stopped. The brush hovered. "I was uncertain whether to use past tense."

"Present tense," I said. "Apparently."

He studied me. The study was clinical but the hand on the notebook was not — the knuckles white, the grip the kind that left impressions in the binding.

"What did you find?" he asked. "At the bottom."

"A question."

He waited. I did not elaborate. He wrote.

I stood at the edge of the cliff I had jumped off. The standing was the same and different. The difference was inside, where the answer lived.
