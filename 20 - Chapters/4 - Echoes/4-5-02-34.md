The crater was smaller than I remembered.

Four hundred years of erosion and vegetation had softened everything. The rim: rounded, no longer the sharp edge that a volcanic eruption left when it carved a bowl into the mountain's side. The slopes: covered in scrub grass and succession-growth. The interior: a depression, bowl-shaped, thirty meters across. It looked natural unless you knew what had made it.

I knew what had made it.

The lava had been the incidental detail. I had fallen into a volcanic eruption. Not deliberately — no one fell into volcanic eruptions deliberately. Wrong place, wrong time.

The lava had been hot enough to destroy everything it touched. I had been in it. I had been destroyed. I had been not-destroyed. The paradox that constituted my existence: destroyed and present.

I stood at the rim. A volcanic eruption, and the worst part was the nostalgia.

The air here was different — four hundred years of cooling had not erased the mineral taste that volcanic activity left. Sulfuric. Below normal detection but not below mine.

Xu Ran stood behind me. Fifteen paces this time — my faster walking stretching the standard gap. He was breathing heavily. The trip down the mountain had been steep and his broken core made steep things harder.

"This is one of the places?" he asked.

"Lava."

"When?"

"Four hundred years."

His pen moved. Four-hundred-year-old lava. Date, location, substance, outcome.

I descended into the crater.

The slope was gentle — vegetation and erosion had converted the sharp interior walls to walkable angles. I walked down into the bowl. The grass under my feet browned in the standard radius. Three paces. The death-circle inside the old death-site.

At the bottom: stone. Volcanic basalt — dark, dense, the kind of rock that remembered being liquid. I knelt. Put my hand on the stone.

Cold. Four hundred years of cold. What I expected and what I received.

Something vibrated. Or nothing vibrated. The boundary between detection and imagination. Did I feel that? The vibration — if it was a vibration — existed in the substrate's frequency range. The humming-frequency. Which meant: it was either the stone's residual energy or my own energy reflected back.

Both were possible. Neither was confirmable.

I pressed harder. Palm flat on basalt. I listened — not with ears. With the awareness below hearing that the cliff had revealed.

Something. A frequency. Lower than the humming. Different. A signal in the register where my signals operated but that was not mine — or was mine from four hundred years ago. The residual echo of an event that had left: a mark.

"The stone vibrated," I said. To Xu Ran, at the rim. The words traveled upward through the crater's bowl, the acoustics carrying them to where he stood.

He wrote.

I stood. Hand leaving the stone. The vibration ceased. Or continued below the threshold. Or was never there. The ambiguity was the data.

I climbed back to the rim. The grass browned under my feet as I ascended. The crater received my death-radius the way it received everything: as a surface that had already experienced the worst.

Xu Ran showed me the notebook. His entry: date, location, observation. "Subject reports vibration in 400-year volcanic basalt. Duration: ~30 seconds. Self-reported ambiguity — subject uncertain whether detected signal is external or self-generated."

The clinical language was accurate. The clinical language was the kindness.

"Now what?" he asked.

I looked at the crater. One old site. One possible vibration. One ambiguous reading.

"The next one," I said.

He closed the notebook. We walked.
