Morning. The quality of morning light that indicated the sun was above the tree line and that the mist had dissipated.

I stood.

This was not new — standing was the default transition between sitting and the next state. But the standing contained a direction. Not geographic — there was no compass bearing, no destination, no named location toward which the body oriented. The direction was categorical. The direction was: not here.

The disconnection — the gap, the absence of will that had characterized the weeks since the forest — was not repaired. The will was still absent in the form that produced hunger and sleep and the desire for particular outcomes. But below the severed line, in the layer where need operated, in the stratum where the body breathed and the heart beat and the involuntary functions performed their maintenance — below all of that, something had shifted.

Not a decision. Decisions required the architecture that the disconnection had dismantled. Something else. A vector. The directional impulse that indicated: the current position is no longer sustainable and any other position is preferable and the preference is not a choice but a necessity.

I had no possessions to pack. The recognition of this — the awareness that packing was the action that preceded departure and that packing required possessions and possessions were a category I no longer inhabited — was ironically the first thing that felt familiar. I had often left with nothing. Leaving with nothing was the oldest form of departure. The form that predated luggage.

I moved. Not walked — moved. The distinction was the direction. Walking was the undirected locomotion that the body performed when standing was exhausted. Moving was the directed locomotion that the body performed when the direction existed and the direction was: away from here.

Xu Ran watched.

He was sitting at the fire — the morning fire, the one he made each day with the routine that characterized his mornings. Rice steaming. Notebook open. The pen: paused. He had been writing and the writing had stopped when I moved.

"You're packing," he said.

"I have nothing to pack."

"You're making the motions."

He was right. The body — the muscle memory that ten thousand years of departures had worn into the bones — was performing the departure sequence. Shoulders: adjusted. Weight: shifted to the balls of the feet. Gaze: forward, elevated, the visual orientation that preceded sustained travel. The motions of packing without the possessions to pack. The ghost of departure.

He closed his notebook. Not the closure of someone finishing a thought. The deliberate closure of someone recognizing that the phase had changed. He did not put it away — the notebook was never away, never inaccessible, because inaccessible produced forgetting and forgetting was the thing he fought. He held it. Closed. Against his chest.

"Where?" he asked.

The question was valid. Direction was the variable that the departure-sequence required and that the vector provided and that the vector did not specify. The vector said: away. The vector did not say: toward what. Away was the beginning, not the map.

I did not answer. Not from the disconnection — from the genuine absence of an answer. Where was the question and the question was the space that would fill itself as the movement continued, the way a river's destination was determined by the terrain and not by the water. I would go. The going would encounter geography. The geography would produce the where.

He stood. The fire: abandoned. The rice: untouched, still steaming. He looked at the rice. The rice steamed. He looked at me. He left the rice.

Xu Ran did not abandon rice lightly. Xu Ran did not abandon routine lightly. Routine was his defense, and he was setting it aside.

"Weiter," he said.

One word. Not a question — a direction. Not an encouragement — a statement. The word contained everything about him in a single syllable: forward, next, continue. The word that opposed stopping. The word that refused the static. The word that said: whatever happens now, it happens in the direction of further, and further is the only direction available.

*Weiter.*

He picked up his pack. The worn pack with the patched seams and the ginger pouch and the notebooks — plural, I now realized, he carried more than one — and the scratched pot and the provisions that sustained a body that needed sustaining. He picked it up with the practiced economy of someone for whom the picking-up was as automatic as my standing.

The morning air was cold. His body creaked when he stood — the left side, the compensation, the cost of carrying a broken core through mountain terrain for weeks. He did not complain. He adjusted the pack on his shoulders and the adjustment favored the right side and the favoring was the injury talking.

The body oriented. East — or the direction that the body chose without the mind's participation. East, because east was the direction the face pointed and the face pointed east because the tree line broke there and the break was the path of least resistance and the path of least resistance was the route that the direction-absent body selected.

I walked. The first step: the same as every step since the hut. The second step: different. Different because behind me, ten paces behind me, Xu Ran walked too. The ten-pace distance maintained with the precision that had characterized every day of his presence. Ten paces. The gradient. Brown to yellow to green. The ecological distance between what I was and what lived.

Ten paces behind me, someone followed. Not because I led — I did not lead. Because he followed. The distinction was his choice, not mine. Following was his verb. His choice. Accepted the moment he picked up his pack.

The forest opened ahead. The forest closed behind. Between us: ten paces. Between me and the world: three. The math was simple. The math was the architecture of every future interaction: close enough to hear, far enough to survive, the distance that coexistence required between someone who killed grass and someone who wrote about it.

Two figures on a path. One ahead. One behind. The morning light between them, casting shadows that fell in the correct direction.

For now.
