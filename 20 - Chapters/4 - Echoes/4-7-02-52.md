I found his notebook on the second day.

Not the second notebook — the personal one. The compulsive-documentation one. The one with the miniature script and the density and the years of recorded observation. I found it in the debris field, forty paces from the center of the shockwave. The binding was damaged — cracked spine, pages loose. A book that had been thrown by force. But the pages were: intact. The writing: legible.

He was sleeping when I found it. The deep, unstructured sleep that broken ribs and concussions demanded. He had walked for four hours and then stopped — not by choice but by capacity. His capacity was: four hours. The remainder of the day was: rest.

I sat with the notebook. On a root. In the filtered light of the forest that we had reached after leaving the destroyed clearing.

I opened it.

This was the moment. Not dramatic — not the drama that a different telling would have assigned. A hand opening a notebook. The turning of a page.

But the moment was: mine. The notebook had been offered before — by Xu Ran, deliberately, carefully, in the second notebook with the organized sections and the legible handwriting. That offering had been his initiative. His structure. His document.

This was different. This was: I took it. Without permission, without arrangement, without the mediated framework of his careful presentation. I took the original notebook and opened it and began to read.

The reading was an act of will. The knotted will that the cliff had produced and the folded page had sustained and the poison experiment had tested.

His handwriting was miniature. Dense. Someone who wrote faster than neatness permitted. I read slowly.

The entries were chronological. Day by day. The first entry: *Day 1. Found her. Oak tree. 10 paces. No response. Qi-radius constant, approximately 3 meters. No food consumed. No sleep observed. No directional preference. Subject appears functional but unmotivated. Pupils reactive. Breathing regular. Immortal-level baseline.*

Subject. He had called me subject. The clinical word of someone maintaining distance through vocabulary.

The entries continued. Day by day. The documentation of my gradual, incremental, barely perceptible change. The word counts. The qi-measurements. The directional data. The sleep patterns. Everything quantified. Everything recorded. Everything preserved in the miniature script of a man who understood that my memory could not be trusted and that his notebook was the only reliable record.

Three observations emerged. Not conclusions — observations. The careful, hedged observations of someone who knew the difference.

First: it comes from inside me. The qi-events, the protection, the shockwave, the fall-arrest — all originating from a point below the dantian, below the meridian structure, below the cultivated architecture. Something deeper. Something that was part of my body the way bones were — structural, foundational, pre-existing.

Second: something does not want me to understand. The headaches correlated with cognitive progress. The memory gaps correlated with insight. The erasures correlated with pattern-recognition. The defense was reactive and targeted and it operated against understanding. The substrate — his word, borrowed from geological vocabulary, meaning the layer beneath the visible surface — defended itself against being known.

Third: the reality-glitches and the not-dying were connected. The retroactive path and the arrested fall and the neutralized poison — these events shared a mechanism. The same thing that prevented my death also altered reality in my vicinity. The same source. The same layer. The same: me.

I read these three observations. In his careful handwriting. In his hedged, clinical language. And the headache did not come.

The headache did not come because the observations were not mine. They were his. Written in his hand, in his notebook, in his vocabulary. Whatever lived inside operated against my understanding — against patterns forming in my mind. But reading his understanding was: different. Reading was input. Input was passive. Passive was: not threatening.

The loophole. The weakness in the defense that allowed external comprehension to enter where internal comprehension was blocked. I could not think the patterns into existence. But I could read them.

The notebook was the door.

I put it down. Carefully. At the same angle, the same position. He would know I had read it — the pages arranged differently from how they had been. He would know.

*You positioned everything.*

Xu Ran was cooking. On the small fire he had built one-handed — the ribs precluding two-handed motion. Rice again. The smell was: familiar.

The smell should have triggered a memory. The rice-smell. The cooking. The woman who had cooked for me eight hundred years ago — the woman who coughed and whom I had watched without helping. The rice-smell was the sensory channel that the Andock-Regel would have used to attach the memory to the present.

Nothing came.

The memory was not there. The place where the recall should have operated was: empty. Not erased — I could remember that I had once remembered the woman. But the memory itself — the texture, the detail, the lived experience — was gone. Like a room where someone had turned off the light. The room existed. I knew it existed. I could not see what was inside it.

I frowned. I continued.
