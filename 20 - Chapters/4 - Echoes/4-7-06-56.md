"The answer is inside me," I said.

We were sitting by a river. Not a river — a generic, unremarkable, functionally-adequate river that provided water and a place to stop and the ambient sound of moving fluid that the environment offered. The river was: context. The words were: the thing.

"The answer is inside me. So I have to go in."

The longest sentence I had spoken in months. From silence to one word (*Me*) to two words (*You too*) to a complete declarative statement with subject, verb, object, and logical conclusion.

Xu Ran looked at me. He was sitting against a tree — the posture that his ribs demanded, the vertical support that external structure provided. His arm was improving. The swelling had diminished. The bruising around his eye had progressed from purple-yellow to the greenish-brown of late-stage resolution. His ribs were: unchanged. Ribs healed slowly.

"Sounds unpleasant," he said.

The tone was: flat. The delivery was: dry. The comedic timing — the interval between my earnest declaration and his dismissive one-liner — was: perfect. And the perfection was not rehearsed. He meant it. Going inward — into the defended space, into the thing-below-qi that had nearly killed him — that sounded unpleasant. The assessment was: accurate.

It was the first humor in a long time. Not because the situation was funny. Because the people in the situation had reached the relationship density where humor could occur.

He strapped on his pack. One-handed — the ribs precluding two-handed motion. He adjusted the weight. He stood up. He stood beside me.

I hesitated.

The direction was clear. The purpose was clear. The course was clear. But the first step was: difficult. Not mechanically — my legs worked, my muscles obeyed, the body that survived shockwaves and poisons could certainly walk. Difficult because the first step toward the inward direction was the first step toward the thing that headached and erased and hid.

I stood at the river. Hesitating. The water moved. The day was: present.

"Forward," Xu Ran said.

The word arrived from beside me. Three paces. The distance that the arrangement had settled into since the shockwave — closer than ten, farther than two, the negotiated proximity that accounted for his injury and my danger.

*Forward.*

The third and final time. The guide-word that was his — the one-word directive that governed his approach to: everything. Forward. Continue. Keep going. The word he had first spoken when the walking began. The word he had spoken when the direction crystallized. And now: the word he spoke into my hesitation, into the gap between purpose and motion, into the interval where I knew what to do but had not yet begun doing it.

*Forward.*

I walked.

He followed. Limping. His breathing calibrated for the ribs. His pack adjusted one-handed. His notebook — recovered from the debris, repaired with twine, functional — against his chest.

We walked toward the old crater. The four-hundred-year-old site where lava had cooled and basalt had formed and I had once laid my hand against the stone and felt a vibration that was ambiguous. The place where whatever lived inside had first been suspected — or intuited. The place where I would begin the inward turn.

The crater was: the beginning. The shockwave clearing was: the reckoning. The crater was: the next step.

He meditated that evening. On the ground beside the fire. The lotus position, modified. His breathing, modulated. The sound: quiet. Subdued. Meditation through broken ribs.

I sat beside him.

Three paces. On the ground. Legs crossed. Silent. Facing the same direction — forward, toward the fire.

I was not meditating. I was: there. Present. Beside him while he did the thing that his tradition required and his body resisted and his discipline maintained despite the resistance.

I was: simply there.

Not annoyed. Not calmed. Not anything that required a word. Just: beside him. The quality of shared space that did not produce meaning but produced: comfort. If comfort was the right word. If the right word existed for the condition of sitting beside someone in silence while a fire burned and the night arrived and the direction was: forward.

He finished. He opened his eyes. He saw me sitting three paces away. In the same position I had been in when he closed his eyes.

He said nothing. I said nothing. The fire burned.

Some things did not require language. Some things were: established. The arrangement. The proximity. The routine that was not routine but was: the closest thing they had to home.
