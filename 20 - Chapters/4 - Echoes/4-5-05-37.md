He wrote faster now.

Not faster in the sense of rushed — faster in the sense of urgent. The notebook was no longer his project but her lifeline.

He wrote before I spoke. He wrote during speech. He wrote after, filling gaps: her posture, her expression, the behavioral markers her words did not contain. He wrote as if constructing a backup Yun — a Yun-on-paper who would exist even if the Yun-in-person forgot.

"Three eggs and the leftover rice," he said, at the fire, on a morning that followed a night that I mostly remembered.

"When did I say that?"

He showed me the notebook. Third entry from the top. The date. The time. My words: three eggs and the leftover rice.

I had asked for breakfast. With a preference. Three eggs and the leftover rice — the request of someone who detected hunger and articulated it. Hunger was shifting. Not fully restored — but present. Intermittent.

I did not remember asking.

This was the pattern. Not consistent erasure — selected erasure. The memories that disappeared connected to the investigation, to the substrate, to the cognitive territory the self-protection targeted. Other memories remained: I remembered his meditation from last night (still loud, still irritating, still the acoustic assault that constituted his evening procedure). I remembered the argument about ginger.

The investigation-adjacent memories: gone. Edited with the precision of a surgeon removing tissue while leaving surrounding structures intact.

Xu Ran was my memory now. Not metaphorically. His notebook contained the record that my mind no longer reliably maintained. His pages contained the thoughts I had thought and forgotten and would think again and might forget again.

Millennia of self-sufficiency, and my memory was being maintained by a man whose evening breathing exercises sounded like a water buffalo with ambitions.

He adapted.

The notebook entries changed format. Previous entries: observational. His perspective. His analysis. "Subject reports vibration." "Subject spoke eleven words." "Subject shows behavioral markers consistent with —"

New entries: instructional. My perspective. My words, quoted exactly. The format of someone who was writing not for his own reference but for the reader who would need the content to reconstruct herself.

"Read this every morning," he had written. At the top of a new section. In handwriting deliberately larger than his usual miniature — readable at first glance, without squinting.

The section contained: what we were doing. What we had found. What I had concluded. The briefing that restored awareness.

He had turned his notebook into my morning briefing.

This was careful. Not generous. Not kind. Not performed-compassion. Careful. Someone who recognized a structural problem and implemented a structural solution. The solution was: paper.

He was also paranoid.

This I noticed over days. He looked behind us. Not often — not dramatic. Intermittently. The frequency of head-turns that indicated background monitoring, passive surveillance of a threat he was not discussing.

His handwriting, when he noticed me watching, steadied. The shake was present when he was unobserved and absent when he was observed. Control.

Something had happened.

I did not know what. The memory gap covered the relevant period. Something had happened to him during my investigation and the something had changed his behavior: fear. Not of me. Not of the substrate. Fear of something external.

"Are you alright?" I asked.

The question surprised us both. Not the content — the asking. I had asked if he was alright. The asking required: detecting another person's state, comparing it with a baseline, identifying deviation, articulating inquiry. Four steps the disconnection had prevented and the cliff-shift had partially restored.

"Fine," he said. The lie was the same shape as mine: small, necessary, protective.

He wrote. I watched him write. The person writing was the only reliable record of my existence and the record was being maintained by hands that shook when no one was looking.

*Genug.*

We continued. He wrote. I forgot. He reminded. I continued.

He compensated. I failed. He compensated. I failed.

The dependency was not comfortable. Millennia of self-sufficiency, now conditional on a broken-core researcher with a notebook and a pen and a fear he wouldn't name.

But the dependency was functional.

You never told me about the spy at the crater. I found page forty-seven eventually.

And functional was more than I had managed alone.
