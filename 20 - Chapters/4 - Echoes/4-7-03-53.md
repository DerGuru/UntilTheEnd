Breakfast happened.

Xu Ran cooked it one-handed. The rice was unevenly heated — some grains soft, others crunchy, the overall quality: functional. He served it in the wooden bowl. He placed it at the transition distance — six paces, the cooking-and-negotiation zone that the arrangement had established.

He ate his portion. Slowly. The ribs governing the pace — each breath between bites, each swallow a negotiation with the structural damage.

"/ʘ͡ǀ↓/," he said.

Not a question. Not an invitation. A statement. The old tongue — my words, used back to me. Meal. We are having a meal. The labeling of a domestic action as a domestic action.

He was staying. Not because he had decided to stay — he had never decided to leave. The staying was the default. The continuation of the arrangement that had begun when he arrived at ten paces with a notebook and a question. The shockwave had not altered the arrangement. His broken ribs had not altered the arrangement. The word — *Me* — had not altered the arrangement. The arrangement: persisted.

The staying was not loyalty. I recognized this because loyalty required the emotional architecture that characterized human attachment, and his attachment was: ambiguous. He stayed because the investigation was incomplete. He stayed because the notebook contained three observations and the three observations required additional data and the additional data required proximity and the proximity required: staying.

He stayed because he wanted to see.

The curiosity was his primary driver — the compulsive, systematic, documentation-oriented curiosity that had led him to search for three months and to carry a poison phial and to stand at ten paces during an experiment that nearly killed him. The curiosity was: undamaged. The ribs were broken, the arm was healing, his balance was still off. The curiosity was: intact.

"I read your notebook," I said.

He looked up from his rice. The arrested motion of someone who had anticipated this and prepared his response.

"I know."

"You left it where I could find it."

He said nothing. The silence was: confirmation. He had positioned the notebook. He had arranged for me to find it. The indirect facilitation that characterized his approach — not offering, not withholding, but placing things where I would encounter them when I was ready.

"The three observations," I said.

He raised an eyebrow.

"They're correct."

He resumed eating. The measured rhythm of a man who had received the confirmation he wanted. The observations were correct. I had verified them. The investigation proceeded.

He meditated after breakfast. On the ground — the lotus position modified for the broken ribs, his torso tilted to accommodate the structural compromise. The meditation was: quieter. The breathing technique he employed — whatever his tradition prescribed — was modulated for the ribs. Shallow breaths. Reduced volume. The meditation that had been characterized by its audible, disruptive quality was now: subdued.

I sat beside him.

Not opposite. Not at ten paces. Not at six. Beside. Three paces. The proximity that indicated: tolerance. I sat and he meditated and the sitting-and-meditating occurred in the shared space and the sharing was: unremarkable.

I was there. Present. Beside him while he meditated. Two people occupying shared space without requiring the space to produce meaning.

He finished. The meditation duration was shorter than usual — the ribs limiting the sustained breathing that his technique required. He opened his eyes. He saw me sitting three paces away. He registered the proximity. He said nothing.

The day continued.

They walked. Slowly — his ribs dictating the pace, his occasional pauses dictating the rhythm. I waited when he paused. I waited. He resumed. We continued.

The forest was: forest. Trees. Path. Grade. Temperature. The inputs that walking required, processed without embellishment.

Xu Ran's breathing was careful all day. The shallow, considered breaths of someone whose ribs were broken. I heard each breath. I matched my pace to those breaths without acknowledging the matching.

By evening, we had covered the distance that I would normally cover in two hours. The disparity was: the measure of what I had done to him. The physical evidence, embodied in pace and breath and the careful way he lowered himself to the ground when we stopped.

I built the fire. I cooked the rice. I served it.

We ate in silence. The domestic choreography that had replaced conversation. The routine that was not routine but was: structure. Something to organize the hours around. Something that did not require understanding, only doing.
