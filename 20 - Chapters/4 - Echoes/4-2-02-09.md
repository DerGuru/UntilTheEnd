Days. An indeterminate number that Xu Ran probably tracked in his notebook and that I registered as repetitions of the light-dark cycle rather than as units of human-relevant time.

He talked.

Not to me, specifically — or to me, but in the manner of someone who addressed a wall or a mountain or any surface that was present and solid and that would receive the words regardless of whether it processed them. He talked about the weather. About the terrain. About the quality of the soil in this region and how it compared to the soil in the eastern provinces, how soil quality correlated with qi density, how qi density correlated with cultivation potential. He talked because talking was the thing he did.

He talked and I did not respond and the not-responding did not deter him.

"The temperature dropped three degrees since yesterday," he said, on a morning that was indistinguishable from the previous morning. "Your radius seems tighter in cold weather. Have you noticed that?"

I had not noticed that. Noticing required the kind of directed attention that the disconnection impaired. But the information was received: radius tighter in cold.

"Or maybe it's not the cold," he said, writing. "Maybe it's the humidity. The correlation isn't clear yet."

He was studying me.

Not secretly — openly, with the transparency of a researcher who had no need for subtlety because the subject was not going to object. He measured. He observed. He noted. He compared morning readings to evening readings, weather to radius, activity to output.

"I'll understand what you are," he said once, to the notebook more than to me. "I leave when I understand. Not before."

His motivating statement. His terms of engagement. He would stay until he understood and he would go when he understood and the understanding was the currency and the currency was the only thing that would purchase his departure.

I did not care whether he stayed or left. Caring required preference and preference required will and will was the disconnected cable. He existed. He was present. He was the human-shaped fact at ten paces that remained a fact regardless of my engagement with it.

He was not Wei.

The observation arrived without the wound that such observations should have produced. He was not Wei the way the forest was not a building and the sky was not the ground — categorically, obviously, without the emotional loading that comparison usually carried. Xu Ran was angular where Wei had been compact. Xu Ran was precise where Wei had been raw. Xu Ran asked questions that Wei would never have thought to ask. Xu Ran studied where Wei had simply existed.

And Xu Ran's core was broken.

I could feel it — had felt it since his arrival. The signature of a core that had healed wrong, the way a bone heals wrong when it's not set properly. His cultivation: stunted. Not absent — functioning, the way a three-legged animal functioned, compensating and managing with less. But stunted. The break was old and the healing had calcified the damage into permanence.

He cultivated anyway. Every night. The loud meditation — the audible breathing, the murmured mantras, the sound of someone pushing qi through channels that did not fully cooperate. He did it louder than necessary. Not carelessness but strategy: for him, silence was the enemy.

"You can hear it, can't you," he said on the third or fourth night, between breaths. Not a question. "The break."

The break was audible the way a wrong note was audible in a piece of music one had heard correctly a thousand times. Not loud. Not dramatic. Present.

I said nothing.

"Did you know," he said, opening the notebook, "that a broken core produces a resonance pattern? Different from an intact core. The harmonic is shifted — about a quarter-tone flat, consistently. Every broken core I've studied shows the same shift."

A quarter-tone flat. He had studied broken cores. Plural. He had studied them the way he studied my death-radius, with instruments and notation and the patience of someone who believed all phenomena were explainable.

"Yours isn't broken," he said. "But it isn't normal either."

He wrote something. Three lines. Closed the notebook.

"I don't know what it is yet."

The yet was the word that contained everything about him — the assumption of eventual understanding, the confidence that time and observation would produce the answer, the refusal to accept not-knowing as a permanent state. Yet. As in: currently unresolved but resolvable. As in: patience plus method equals answer. As in: he would stay.

The food appeared daily. Set at six paces — the transition zone, where the grass was yellow. Rice. Dried fruit. Strips of preserved meat. The provisions of a traveler who had packed for months.

I did not eat.

The food remained. Untouched. The rice dried. The fruit darkened. The meat stiffened in the air. Small transformations, daily, in a row of rejected offerings that he replaced without comment, without emotion — the reset of an experiment.

He set food. I did not eat. He noted this. He set food again.

"Still nothing," he said, to the notebook. "She doesn't eat. Consistent. No variation."

He was writing about me in clinical terms and the clinical terms were the most honest description I had received in recent memory. Clinical was accurate. Clinical was the mode that matched the condition. I was a phenomenon and he was the observer and the observation was the relationship and the relationship was the only kind available when one party had disconnected from the machinery of wanting.

The notebook filled. Pages. He wrote small — the handwriting of someone conserving space, miniature letters that said this record matters more than comfort. He wrote fast. He wrote always. He wrote the way other people breathed.

Silence is forgetting. I did not know this about him yet. But the evidence was there, in the compulsive notation, in the audible meditation, in the refusal of quiet. He filled space with record because the alternative was the disappearance of everything he had observed, and the disappearance was the thing he feared.

He did not tell me this. He did not need to. His pen told it. His breath told it. The notebook — rain-stained, dog-eared, filled from the first page with handwriting so small it required effort to read — told it.

He was still here.

I stood. I walked. I stopped. I stood. The cycle repeated and he repeated with it, the ten-pace shadow that catalogued the cycle without attempting to change it.

On some day — five or seven or nine — he asked: "Does it bother you? That I'm here?"

The question required the detection of bothered and bothered required the detection of preference and preference was disconnected.

I did not answer.

He wrote.
