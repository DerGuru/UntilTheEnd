"Wir gehen."

I said it on the morning that the direction became: exact. Not the general inward direction that the cliff had set and the poison had confirmed. The direction. The crater. The four-hundred-year-old site where basalt remembered lava and the vibration lived in the stone.

"Wir gehen."

Two words. The initiative was: mine. I said it. Not a question, not a request, not a response to his suggestion. An initiation. I spoke first. I decided first. I moved first.

Xu Ran looked up from the fire he was extinguishing. The morning was grey — the grey of early hours, before the sky committed to weather. He had slept poorly — the ribs, still. The coughing had diminished to occasional, but the sleeping was still compromised by the positional limitations that broken bones imposed.

"Wohin?" he asked.

Where to.

I looked at him. His pale face. His healing bruises. His careful breathing. The notebook against his chest, repaired with twine, containing the observations that were the external archive of my investigation. The pack on his back, one-strapped. The evidence of a man who had been damaged by my proximity and who had stayed.

"Rein."

One word. The last word.

*Rein.*

The Leitwort. The word that had arrived at the cliff when I chose understanding over death. The word that had arrived at the clearing when the shockwave proved the source was inside me. And now: the word that named the destination. Not a location. A direction. Not outward toward the crater, though the crater was where the feet would go. Inward toward the thing-below-qi, toward the defended space where something lived and hid and protected and destroyed.

*Rein.*

He nodded. The acknowledgment of someone who understood the destination and did not require elaboration. He strapped his pack. He extinguished the fire completely — the careful, thorough process of someone who respected what fire could do when unattended. He stood. He winced — the ribs, the standing, the daily negotiation with damage.

We walked.

Two figures on a path. One upright, sure, my stride unconstrained by the physical limitations that governed mortal bodies. One limping, careful, his breathing shallow and measured, his pace determined by the ribs that I had broken. Between them: fewer than ten paces now. The distance had contracted across the weeks — from the initial ten to six to three to this: seven. Not a linear progression. An oscillation that was settling toward: close.

The forest was forest. The path was path. The morning did its morning things — light increasing, temperature responding, the incremental changes that constituted a day's beginning. Nothing remarkable. Everything ordinary. Two people walking.

And inside me: the hum.

I noticed it for the first time that morning. Not the qi — the qi was above, in the meridian structure, in the cultivated channels that the Shadow-Eater had tried to dissolve. This was below the qi. This was from the place where the warmth had originated during the poison experiment. The place where the thing-below lived.

The hum was quiet. Below the threshold of sound. I felt it rather than heard it — the vibration that occurred at the frequency where hearing became feeling, where the ear’s range ended and the body’s resonance began. A hum that lived in my bones.

It followed me. Or: it was me. The hum was not external — not the forest, not the wind, not the sounds around me. The hum was: internal. Produced by the thing-below. The thing that was part of me. The thing that the direction pointed toward.

The hum was like breathing. A second breathing. The rhythm of something that was not my lungs but that shared my body and that had been breathing all along and that I was only now hearing because my hearing had been changed by the cliff and the poison and the shockwave and the *Rein*.

Echoes.

The word for what was happening. Sound reflecting off surfaces and returning changed. The things you said that came back to you altered. The things that happened that resonated through subsequent events and arrived at the present diminished but: present.

The hum was the echo. Of what — I did not know. Of the thing-below. Of the warmth that woke when the poison reached the dantian. Of the voice that said *Nicht jetzt* in the dawn after the shockwave. Of the always-there that I was only now beginning to hear.

I walked. He limped. The forest passed. The morning matured into day. The hum continued — quiet, persistent, the second breathing that my body produced from the layer that the sects did not teach and the scrolls did not describe and the cultivators did not know.

Between us: seven paces. His notebook. My direction. The arrangement that was: us.

Ahead: the crater. Behind: the clearing, the destruction, the evidence.

Inside: the hum.

Like a second breathing. Like someone else’s heartbeat, heard through a wall. Like: not alone.

I walked. He walked. The hum followed. Or led. Or both.

*Rein.*
