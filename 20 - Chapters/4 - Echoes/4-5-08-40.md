We did not speak about the smile for three days.

Three days of the ten-pace distance and the notebook and the smile existing between us like an object on a table — present, visible, not discussed.

On the third day, I stopped.

Not the headache-stop — the deliberate stop. A person who had reached a conclusion.

The memory came first. The disgust from the clearing — the hand-to-mouth — that was the trigger.

The memory opened.

A war. Different era. Large enough to be regional, long enough to be generational. I was in it because proximity was the condition and the condition was: permanent.

I was on a battlefield. After. The smoking terrain. The scattered bodies. The smell of iron and burned earth and something chemical — the sweetness that large-scale qi-discharge left in the air, the smell that meant: many people had been alive here and now were not.

I was laughing.

Not the quiet laugh of irony. Laughing. Full, diaphragmatic, the sound of actual amusement. I was amused. By the battlefield. By the bodies.

I remembered the laugh the way one remembers a photograph from a different era. Recognizable. Distant.

The clearing's smile and the battlefield's laugh were the same expression separated by centuries.

If I continued fighting, I would become the person who laughed on battlefields.

Not become — return. One more fight. Two more. That was all it would take.

No.

The no was mine. Not the substrate's no — mine. The first fully owned decision since the cliff.

*Mir reicht's.*

No more seeking violence.

"Weiter," Xu Ran said. He was behind me. At the distance.

The word hit the spine, not the mind. No more fighting. Keep going.

"You stopped walking an hour ago," he added. Flat. The observation of someone who had been counting.

I walked.

He followed.

The distance: ten paces. The gradient: brown to yellow to green.

The talisman in my robe: present. *The new one.*

We walked. Behind us: seven disabled cultivators and one running. Ahead: the investigation, the notebook, the headaches, the things I had not yet found.

No more fights.

The will — rough, knotted, an old thread fraying under load — the will held the decision. For now.

For *weiter*.
