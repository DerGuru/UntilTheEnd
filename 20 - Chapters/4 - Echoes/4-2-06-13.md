He cooked.

This was the surprising thing — not that he cooked, because cooking was a survival skill that anyone who traveled would develop, but that he cooked well. With the competence of practice beyond necessity, the kind of cooking that emerged from someone who had decided food was not just fuel but the closest approximation of control available in an uncontrollable world.

Rice. Vegetables foraged from the surrounding forest — he knew his botany, knew what was edible and what would kill you, what was desirable and what was merely tolerable. Something with ginger root. The ginger was unexpected — he carried it, apparently, the way other travelers carried weapons or talismans. Ginger root, in a pouch, wrapped in cloth.

The ginger. Mei had used ginger. The woman by the river, eight centuries ago, the crooked finger and the patient cooking. Different ginger, different century, same smell. The connection fired before I could stop it — hot, clean, and gone.

The fire was small. Efficient. He maintained it with the attention of someone who understood the relationship between heat distribution and cooking outcome and took both seriously. The pot — a single pot, scratched, dented, the wear of daily use for months — sat on stones arranged to direct heat upward.

The smell reached me at eight paces. Before the radius. Inside the green zone. Rice steam and ginger and heated vegetables, and the combination was: food.

I did not eat.

I sat.

This was new. Not the sitting — I sat and stood and walked in patterns the body determined without input from the will. I was sitting near a cooking fire with a cooking person. Not hunger. Not desire. Something older. A habit the body remembered — the posture of someone who had, in other centuries, sat near fires while food was prepared. The body assumed the posture. The will was not consulted.

I sat six paces from the fire. At the edge of the transition zone. The gradient: green grass (his side), yellow grass (between), brown grass (mine). Six paces of ecological commentary on my proximity.

He noticed. He did not look up. The discipline of someone who had learned not to acknowledge behavioral changes in the subject because acknowledgment could disrupt the behavior, and the behavior was data: she sat.

He stirred the pot. Added something — salt, from a smaller pouch. The salt dissolved. The steam changed quality. The smell deepened.

"You're staring."

His voice was level. Directed at the pot. Someone reporting an observation without making eye contact — the tactical communication of a person who understood that direct address could terminate the interaction.

I was staring. Not deliberately — staring was the default state of eyes that were open and that faced something and that had no directive to look elsewhere. The fire was in front of me. The pot was on the fire. He was next to the pot. The visual field contained: fire, pot, person, steam.

"I'm evaluating," I said.

The words surprised me. Not their content — evaluating was accurate, or as accurate as any word could be for the thing the disconnected mind did when it observed a process without having a stake in its outcome. The surprise was the production. The vocalization. I had not spoken voluntarily since the tree-branch exchange.

"And?" he said. Still to the pot.

Silence.

He waited. Three seconds. Five. The interval that followed a semi-question and that closed naturally when no response came. The interval closed.

He served himself. A bowl — same scratched, dented aesthetic as the pot, the matching wear of a set that had been carried together for months. He ate with the focused efficiency of someone who treated meals as scheduled events rather than optional activities.

He did not serve me. He did not offer. He did not set food at the transition zone with the expectant generosity of someone hoping the offering would be accepted. He cooked for himself. He ate for himself. The cooking was his and the eating was his and the not-sharing was a form of respect that I recognized intellectually without being able to appreciate emotionally.

He was not performing generosity. He was not trying to feed me back to life. He was eating dinner.

The distinction mattered. The distinction was the thing that separated him from people-who-tried-to-help and placed him among people-who-existed-nearby. The first category produced the anxiety of obligation — the awareness that someone was investing effort that would be wasted. The second produced: nothing. Xu Ran eating dinner beside a fire that I sat near was the same as rain falling on a roof I happened to be under. Coincidental proximity. No transaction.

Something — small, internal, behind my sternum — relaxed a fraction. Not enough to constitute a change. Enough to constitute a variation. The difference between absolute zero and one degree above: technically warmer. Technically changed. Functionally identical.

But the measurement existed.

He finished. Cleaned the bowl with grass and sand — the field method of a traveler with no access to soap. Packed the pot. The ginger pouch: rewrapped, restored to its position in his pack. The fire: allowed to diminish. The entire process performed with the routine of someone whose evening followed the same structure every evening. Their structure was the thing that kept the evenings from becoming silence.

She sat.

I knew he would write this. I knew the notebook would receive the datum — subject sat near cooking fire. Duration: seventeen minutes. Distance: six paces. Consumed: nothing. But she sat.

He wrote it. The pen in the firelight. The miniature letters.

I sat until the fire was embers. Then I stood. Then I walked to my standard distance — the clearing edge, the brown-grass zone, the location that maximum separation provided within the geography of camp.

He did not watch me go. Or he watched from the corner of his eye, the peripheral observation of someone who had learned that some data was best collected indirectly. He watched or he didn't.

The almost-smile.

Not a smile. Not even the beginning of a smile. The thing that happened at the corner of my mouth — a twitch, suppressed before it became visible. The fact that there was something to suppress. The fact that his comment and my response and the not-eating and the sitting-nearby had produced, somewhere behind my ribs, the impulse that in another context and another century would have been: humor.

It was not humor. It was the echo of humor. The vibration of a string that had been played in a different room.

But the string existed.
