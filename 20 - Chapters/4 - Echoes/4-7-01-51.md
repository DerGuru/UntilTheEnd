The morning was grey and physical and true.

Ash from the fire. Grey residue of wood burned through the night — white at the center, grey at the edges. The ash covered the ground around the fire pit and beyond: devastation. Fallen trees. Fissured earth. The radius of my protection made visible in snapped trunks and displaced soil.

I sat on a stone. My shirt was torn — the sleeve missing, used for his bandage, the remaining fabric insufficient and dirty and bearing the evidence of a night spent tending a fire and a man. Dust in my hair. His blood still on my hands, the dried-brown patina that resisted casual washing.

Xu Ran was under the blanket I had taken from his pack. The blanket covered everything except his face, which was: pale. Pallor of blood loss. The laceration bandage had bled through during the night — a dark stain through my sleeve-fabric that indicated the wound was deeper than the initial assessment had suggested. His breathing was shallow, the ribs dictating depth.

He woke.

The transition — a change in breathing, a facial contraction, the eyes opening with the squint of someone returning to consciousness through pain. He woke and the waking was accompanied by: coughing.

The cough was deep and wet and immediately punished by the ribs. He curled — the involuntary protective response, the body folding around the broken structure. The cough continued. Three repetitions. Each one producing the facial expression of: stop. Each one continuing regardless.

Eventually the coughing settled. He straightened — slowly. The careful, incremental motion of someone for whom every degree of change was a negotiation with pain. He sat up. The blanket fell. The bandage was visible. The bruise around his left eye was: advanced. Purple-yellow. Two days of bleeding under the skin.

He was dizzy. I could see it — the way his eyes tracked and then overcorrected. The concussion was still working. He sat upright but the uprightness was precarious. His hand went to the ground. Stabilizing.

"Water," I said. I handed him the water-skin. He drank. Small sips. Careful. The ribs would not let him breathe deeply enough for large swallows.

He looked around. At the destroyed clearing. At the fallen trees. At me. At the stone I sat on. At the grey and physical and true morning.

He said nothing about the destruction. Nothing about the night. Nothing about the word.

He reached for his pack. Found the rice. Looked at it. Put it down.

"Not yet," he said.

The ribs. Cooking required motion. Motion required breath. Breath required ribs that were not broken but his were.

I stood. I took the rice. I took the pot. I built the cooking fire from the residual embers and the broken wood that surrounded us in abundance.

I cooked.

The cooking was: mechanical. The practiced motions of food preparation that I had performed for millennia. Water. Rice. Heat. Duration. The sequence was stored in the kind of memory that the erasures did not reach because cooking threatened nothing.

Xu Ran watched. From his position on the ground. His good eye — the right one, the unswollen one — tracking my motions with the observational intensity that was his nature. His notebook was still missing. Somewhere in the debris. He could not document.

I served the rice. In the bowl. Placed it beside him. Moved back to my stone.

He ate. Slowly. Each breath between bites calculated for the ribs.

We did not speak.

After — after the eating, after the fire burned lower, after the morning progressed from grey to the slightly-less-grey of overcast — he stood. The standing was an event. The project of a man with broken ribs achieving vertical. He stood, and swayed, and caught himself, and stood.

"We should move," he said.

We should move. Because staying in the circle of destruction was not: sustainable. Because the location was evidence, and evidence attracted attention, and attention was unwelcome. Because the pragmatism that governed his behavior was also operational through broken ribs.

We walked. He walked. Slowly.

I matched his pace. The matching was automatic. He walked slowly because his ribs were broken and his balance was off and his body was running on less than it needed. I walked slowly because he was walking slowly.

I simply: walked at his speed.

He noticed. I saw him notice — the sideways glance, the assessment. My pace matching his. The adjustment I had not mentioned.

He said nothing.

The morning continued. Grey. Physical. True. Two people walking through a forest — one hindered, one unhurt. The unhurt one walking at the hindered one's pace. The arrangement that was something I did not have vocabulary for and that I would not examine because examining was the province of headaches and I did not want a headache today.

We walked. He coughed occasionally. I waited when he paused. We walked.
