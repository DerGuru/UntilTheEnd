"Why are we here?"

The question was genuine. Not performative — not the question of someone who knew the answer and was testing whether the other person also knew it. Genuine. The question of someone standing at the rim of a four-hundred-year-old volcanic crater who did not know why she was standing at the rim of a four-hundred-year-old volcanic crater.

Xu Ran's pen stopped.

Xu Ran's pen did not stop. His pen moved the way his lungs moved — continuously, involuntarily, as a condition of being Xu Ran. The pen stopped.

"You know why we're here," he said. Carefully. Selecting words the way a surgeon selected instruments.

"I don't."

I said this with certainty. Not the disconnection's flatness, not interference. The mind: engaged, operational, reporting. I did not know why we were at this crater. The information that should have been present was: absent.

Xu Ran opened his notebook. In another context: routine. In this context: evidence.

"Read this," he said.

The page: his handwriting. Miniature. Careful. Date. Location. Observation. And then: her words.

*"The stone vibrated." — Yun, crater center, hand on basalt.*

Four words. Attributed to me. In his handwriting.

"I didn't say that," I said.

The notebook was not wrong. I knew this. Xu Ran's documentation was compulsive and precise and his compulsion was his survival and his precision was his identity and neither produced falsehood.

But I did not remember.

The memory was gone. A room where the lights had been turned off and the furniture removed.

*Not yet*, something inside me said. Or had said. While erasing.

"You said it this morning," Xu Ran said. "Three hours ago. At the center of the crater. You put your hand on the stone and you said: the stone vibrated."

Three hours. Not three centuries — not the distant past where memory degradation was natural. Three hours.

Gone.

Something had erased three hours. Not me. The erasing had occurred without my participation, without my consent. Something had erased it the way the substrate had stopped the fall — autonomously, unilaterally.

Something in me did not want me to remember what I had found at the crater.

Frightening because: something inside me controlled what I knew. Informative because: the control was itself data. If something erased the memory, the memory contained something worth erasing.

"Something is fighting me," I said.

Something inside me was resisting the investigation. Something inside me was protecting information from the person whose body contained the information.

Xu Ran wrote. Everything. Fast. The urgency of someone who understood that the woman standing in front of him might forget this conversation too.

"You need to write this down yourself," he said. "Not trust yourself to remember. Not trust me to tell you. Write it."

I did not write. My memory had been reliable for millennia. It was the one thing I could count on.

Apparently: no.

My memory was no longer reliable.

The crater was behind us. The broken trees from the qi-anomaly — I did not remember the qi-anomaly. The cracked ground — I did not remember the cracked ground. The evidence was physical. The evidence was everywhere except in my memory.

Xu Ran held the notebook open. Showing me. The external record of my own life, maintained by someone else, because the internal record was being edited by something that was not me.

I read. His words. My experiences, translated through his observation.

I did not recognize them.

This was the horror. Reading someone else's account of my own actions and finding the account alien. The me in the notebook was a stranger.

I should have started writing then. I didn't. That cost me.

"We keep going," I said. "And you keep writing."

He wrote that down too.
