The page happened three days later.

We had stopped at a stream — narrow, cold, the temperature of mountain runoff from elevation we couldn't see. Xu Ran was filtering water through the cloth he carried for this purpose. I was sitting on a stone. The stone was flat and the flatness was comfortable and the comfort was a category I now noticed.

The notebook was in his pack. The second notebook. He had shown it again that morning, and the headache had come again, and the erasure had operated again, and the pattern had vanished again. The routine.

But.

The direction. Through the erasure, through the forgetting, through the war behind the bones that the substrate conducted against my capacity to understand it — the direction survived. Something inside me was hiding and I was going to find it.

I reached for his pack.

He watched. He did not intervene. No guidance, no prohibition. He watched.

I took the second notebook. I opened it to a blank page at the back.

The headache: absent. The blank page was not a threat because it contained no pattern and no understanding.

I tore it out.

The sound. The ripping fibres. Paper from binding. The physical act of extraction — more decisive than any qi-pulse because it was conducted by the will and the muscles and the hand that chose.

He said nothing.

I placed the page on my knee. I took the brush from his writing kit. The bristles were stiff from insufficient cleaning — his personal-notebook writing was rapid and the maintenance was secondary.

I wrote a word.

Crossed it out.

Wrong. An attempt to name the thing inside me — and the word was wrong because the naming required precision and the precision required understanding and the understanding was erased.

I wrote another word.

Crossed it out.

Wrong again. The available words — power, qi, entity, force — were categories other cultivators used for other phenomena. My phenomenon was: mine. Unique. The thing that stopped falls and erased memories and produced headaches when I thought toward it.

I had no word for it.

I crossed out the second attempt. Two failures and the white space between them.

Third word.

I paused before I wrote it. The brush above the page. Not the substrate's interference — my own uncertainty. The third word was different because it was not a noun.

I wrote: *Why.*

And did not cross it out.

The word sat on the torn page. *Why.* Not what-is-it. *Why.* Why was it hiding. Why was it erasing. Why was the understanding a threat.

The headache did not come.

Significant. The word *Why* did not trigger the defense. The defense operated against understanding, against seeing-what-it-is. But asking why-it-hid was not seeing-what-it-was. The why was adjacent to the what but not identical.

A door. A direction. A method.

I folded the page. Once, twice — a rectangle small enough to hold between two fingers. The paper was warm from my knee. The ink was still wet on the fold. I pressed the edges and the pressing was precise and the precision was mine.

I put it in my belt. Against the skin. A reminder that existed outside the substrate's reach because it was paper and not memory.

The substrate could erase thoughts. It could not erase paper.

I looked at Xu Ran. He was holding the water filter. The cloth was dripping. His expression was the expression of someone who had understood the significance and was choosing not to articulate it because the articulation would contaminate the discovery.

"I tried," he would write later, in the first notebook. The personal one. "That was new."

"I need to test something," I said.

"Test."

"Directly. Not observation. Not memory. Not reading patterns in your notes." I looked at the folded page in my belt. The physical question. "I need to go directly to the source."

He understood. His face changed — risk calculation. The direct approach meant: provocation. Intentional provocation of the substrate. Not waiting for the headaches, not reading around them. Going in.

"How?" he asked.

"I don't know yet."

The honest answer. Flat, factual. I knew the direction and I knew the question and I did not know the procedure.

The procedure would come. The substrate had shown me its defenses — headaches for thinking, erasure for remembering, qi-events for feeling. The defenses were the map. The defended thing was the answer to *Why*.

I stood from the flat stone. The water was filtered. The day continued.

We walked. I chose directions. He followed. The arrangement was: functional.

The folded page was against my skin. The physical question the substrate could not erase.

The next test would be different. Not observation from the outside. Not documentation by proxy. Directly. Into the defended space. Provoke the hiding thing into showing itself.

The method existed. I had felt it at the cliff — the fall forced the substrate to act and the acting revealed it. The cliff was the accident. The intentional version would require: a controlled provocation that would force the substrate to defend and in the defending to reveal.

I knew what the next step was.

I did not say it to Xu Ran.

He would find out.

You found out. You didn't stop me. I never decided whether that was trust or recklessness.

The folded page. The question. The direction.

*Forward.*
