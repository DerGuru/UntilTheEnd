I pushed the bowl closer.

A fingerbreath. The distance that a hand covers when the motion is not a gesture but an instinct — the bowl moving toward me across the gap between placement and possession. The bowl of rice that he had cooked and that I had not asked for and that was positioned at the transition zone where food appeared, as always.

I pushed it closer. A fingerbreath.

The motion was small. The bowl was there. I moved it closer. I ate.

Xu Ran saw it. He was eating his own rice — the careful, rib-governed eating that his injury mandated. He looked up. He saw the bowl's new position — the fingerbreath closer, the displacement that indicated: I wanted the food nearer.

I was eating.

I was eating because the eating was: desired. Someone who moved food closer because the food was wanted.

He almost smiled. The facial muscles engaged — the corners of his eyes, the beginning of something at his mouth. But the smile did not complete. He suppressed it. The suppression was: respect. Don't name it. Don't comment. Don't contaminate the moment with observation.

I looked at him. The bowl against my lips. Rice. A person eating from a bowl that they had moved closer to themselves.

The eating continued. The fire burned. The silence that followed was not empty, not heavy, just: present. Two people who had said enough.

The grief was not gone.

The grief — the question, the *why not him*, the clamped-off condition that had characterized my state since the beginning — the grief was present. The grief had been contained. The search — the investigation, the direction, the inward pull — had given the grief a container. A vessel. A purpose. The grief was not less. The grief was: housed. It lived in a structure now, and the structure gave it boundaries, and the boundaries meant that the grief did not occupy the entire cognitive space. Room existed for other things. For eating. For sitting beside a meditating man. For pushing a bowl closer.

The balance was: unknowable. Progress and loss, simultaneously. I ate (progress). I tried to reach for a Wei-memory — deliberately, consciously, the voluntary recall that should have produced the image of Wei cooking, Wei's hands, Wei's way of cutting vegetables with a blade that was too large for the task.

Static.

Not silence — static. Like a signal that existed but could not be received. Like a room where someone had turned off the light, but with the additional quality of: noise. The static was new. The memory-gaps from earlier — the three-hour erasure, the gradual degradation — had been silent. Empty rooms. This was: a room with something in it that I could not see.

The static lasted for two heartbeats. Then it was gone. The attempt at recall ended. The memory did not arrive.

I could not tell if the memory was being erased or if it was being: protected. The static was ambiguous. Defensive — keeping me out — or protective — keeping something safe.

Three sentences of experience. The static, the two heartbeats, the absence. I did not analyze it. I did not tell Xu Ran. I returned to the rice.

The eating continued. The fire burned. The balance — progress, loss, simultaneously — was the condition of my existence now, and I did not know if the sum was positive or negative, and I did not try to calculate it.

The eating continued. The fire burned.
