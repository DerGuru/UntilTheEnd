The blood tasted like copper. The memory tasted like distance.

The metallic flavor was in my mouth because the sleeve-wound had sent a fine spray that reached my lips. The trajectory of arterial expression when a blade caught the upper arm at the correct angle. The blood was mine. The taste was the trigger, connecting to something older than thinking, and what it produced was:

Memory.

Two thousand years. Or close to it, the approximation that all deep memories carried, the imprecision that the passage of centuries imposed on the timestamps of experience. Two thousand years, give or take the lifespan of a civilization.

A warrior. In a province that no longer existed under any name. In a conflict that no longer existed in any record. The kind of war that consumed a region for a generation and was forgotten within three because the next war was already happening.

He was blind.

This was the detail that survived when most details hadn't. Blind — eyes that did not receive light, that had ceased to function either from birth or from damage. He fought without seeing. He fought with the compensatory awareness that blindness produced: hearing, spatial memory, sensitivity to air movement that told him where bodies were.

He hit me.

The only swordstroke in two thousand years that I hadn't seen coming. Not because I was slow. Because he was different. Because his attack came from a vector that vision-dependent organisms did not anticipate, from an angle that existed in the perceptual framework of someone who navigated the world without the primary sense that everyone else relied on. He cut where sighted fighters didn't cut. He moved where sighted fighters didn't move. And he hit me.

My left side. Below the ribs. A sighted fighter would have avoided that location, too difficult to reach from standard combat positions. For him — blind, navigating by sound, by the displacement of air, by the vibration of the ground — the approach was natural. It was where his perception told him the opening was.

Blood. Mine. The same copper taste that was in my mouth now, millennia later, in a clearing with two unconscious spirit-beasts and two disabled bandits and a researcher with a notebook.

The wound healed. Then too, the same involuntary closure. But I remembered the moment before it closed. The instant when the pain was present and the pain was: connection. The momentary bridge between my body and the acknowledgment that my body existed in a world that could touch it.

The blind warrior died three days later. In the same conflict. Killed by someone less interesting. The mundane death that warriors experienced when the war was large enough and the probability caught up: in a conflict of this scale, everyone dies except her.

I remembered his face. Scarred — the pattern of facial scarring that indicated a life of combat that predated the blindness or coincided with it. He had fought his entire life and his entire life had been approximately forty years. Forty years. A full lifespan.

I had watched him die. From a distance. Close enough to observe, far enough to not intervene. The gap between observing and intervening was the space I inhabited. The space was wide.

The memory closed. The copper faded. The blood on my arm dried.

Xu Ran watched me from ten paces. He had been watching throughout, the unfocused attention that indicated internal processing, the visible signs of someone whose consciousness was elsewhere while the body remained here. He recognized memory-states. He had learned to.

He wrote. Then he spoke.

"How often," he said, "have you done that?"

"Done what."

"Let something hit you."

The question was the analytical precision that characterized his approach: not how-do-you-feel, not are-you-okay, but the operational question that treated the behavior as data rather than trauma.

"Enough," I said.

He wrote the answer. Then he put the notebook down. Put it down. The gesture that indicated a shift from professional to personal, from documenter to person, the rare transition that occurred when the data exceeded the emotional capacity of the collector.

"The spiraling," he said. "You know you're spiraling."

I did not answer. The spiraling — if that was the word — was the escalation that the recklessness followed: from letting a wolf-beast approach, to walking toward cultivators, to allowing a blade past the guard. The trajectory was clear. The trajectory pointed toward: more. More contact. More pain. More of the only real thing available.

"I'm not going to tell you to stop," he said. "But I'm going to write what I see."

"You always write what you see."

"Yes. And what I see is someone who is testing how much damage she can feel before the feeling stops."

The accuracy was uncomfortable. Not because it was wrong. Because it was the kind of right that required the observer to have understood the subject at a level that the subject preferred not to be understood at.

That evening, I cooked.

Not well. Not with any of the competence that Xu Ran brought to the task or any of the accumulated knowledge that millennia should have provided. I cooked because the body performed the action the way it performed all actions: from the muscle memory of previous iterations, from the stored patterns of other centuries when cooking had been the evening activity and the evening activity had been performed.

The rice burned. The vegetables disintegrated. The ginger — his ginger, borrowed without asking — was cut too thin and dissolved into the water and the water was too hot. The heat destroyed the volatile compounds that made ginger ginger.

The smell of burnt rice hung over the camp like an indictment. Acrid, persistent, the olfactory equivalent of a failed argument.

He said nothing. His face said everything. The compression-face, the one that lived between clinical observation and personal offense, was directed at the pot with the intensity of someone watching a crime in progress.

I said nothing.

We both knew.

The meal was inedible. I did not eat it, not from the disconnection's appetite suppression but from the recognition that the product was not food. He did not eat it either, from the same recognition, expressed through diplomatic silence.

He cooked a second meal. Quietly. The ginger: proper thickness. The heat: proper distribution. The meal: edible.

I sat six paces away and watched him cook the replacement for my failure and the watching was the observation of someone who recognized that the failure was significant not because the food was bad but because the attempt had been made. The first voluntary domestic action since the forest. The data was: she tried.

He wrote it down. Of course he did.

You would improve my technique over the years. Slowly. Reluctantly. You never admitted why.
