The clarity lasted three hours.

Three hours in which the double realization — it comes from me, it protects only me — was present and sharp and available for examination. Three hours in which the understanding formed and the understanding was: structural. Not emotional insight, not a feeling about myself, but a clear architectural comprehension of how the thing-below-qi operated.

Then the edges softened.

Gradual. The understanding dimming like a light on a slow mechanism. The double realization remained — I knew I had realized something, I knew it was important — but the details blurred. The architectural comprehension that had been available for three hours became: approximate.

I had understood exactly how the protection worked. Now I understood approximately.

An hour later: I had understood that the protection worked. The how was gone.

Another hour: I had understood something about protection. The what was uncertain.

I was losing something. I was not sure what, which was probably the point.

The erasure was selective and progressive and it operated on the part of the understanding that whatever lived inside identified as threatening. The conclusion — it comes from me, it protects only me — was being degraded from precision to blur. Not destroyed. Degraded. The difference was: important. Previous erasures had been complete — the memory gaps, the three-hour loss, the surgical removal. This was: partial. As if the substrate was working against something that resisted. As if the erasure was meeting opposition.

The voice. The *not yet* voice. The other tenant.

I did not hear it again — not as words, not as the two-word phrase that had arrived in the grey dawn. But the resistance was its signature. It erased; the voice resisted. It degraded; the voice maintained. The tug-of-war conducted inside my body between the thing that hid and the thing that said: not yet.

By midday, what remained was:

Direction. The direction held. Inward. The compass bearing that the cliff had set and the poison experiment had confirmed and the erasure could not delete because the direction existed at the level where the voice operated and the voice was: stronger than the erasure. Or at least: equally strong. The contest was ongoing.

And the feeling. Something in me is alive. Something in me wants me alive. Something in me is willing to destroy everything near me to achieve that objective.

That last part — the destruction, the cost, the collateral damage — the substrate did not erase. Whatever lived inside allowed me to remember the consequence. The broken ribs, the blood, the shockwave. It allowed the guilt — if guilt was what the shaking hands indicated — to remain.

Why?

Because guilt reinforced isolation. Because remembering the damage I caused reinforced the conclusion that I should be alone. The thing beneath and the function of guilt were: aligned. It WANTED me to remember the destruction because the memory served its purpose: keep me isolated. Keep me away. Keep the protection's radius: clear.

The counter-manipulation was elegant. It erased the understanding while preserving the fear. The double realization — degraded. The emotional weight — intact. The result: I knew I was dangerous but could not remember exactly WHY. I could not access the understanding that would allow me to MANAGE the danger. I could only feel it.

A cage made of my own feelings. Maintained by the thing inside me.

I sat on a fallen tree — one of the ones the shockwave had cracked — and I held this realization for as long as I could. The meta-realization: that the selective erasure was itself strategic. That what did this was not mindlessly deleting but carefully curating. That the thing inside me was: intelligent. Or at minimum: purposeful.

The realization degraded. Within minutes. The meta-realization about the strategic erasure was itself erased. The irony: what lived inside erased my understanding that it erased strategically.

What remained after all the degradation was complete:

One sentence. Held at the level where the voice operated. At the level where the direction existed. At the level that the erasure could not fully reach.

What keeps me alive is not a cage. It is a part of me.

The sentence was simple. The sentence was the residue — what was left behind after the filtering removed everything else. The sentence did not explain the mechanism. The sentence did not identify the thing. The sentence said only: it is mine.

At the edge of the wreckage, Xu Ran stirred. His eyes opened. Focused on me.

"You're still here," he said.

"Part of me," I said.

He closed his eyes. The breathing steadied. Sleep, not unconsciousness.
