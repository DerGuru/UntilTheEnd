The sword stall.

Wei had found it the way he found everything — by gravitational pull, the magnetism of metal for a boy who had been training with blades since his hands were large enough to hold one. Their holding was the skill. Their skill was the identity. Their identity was the sword and the sword was this stall and this stall had thirty of them.

I stood at the herb stall across the aisle. Close enough. The distance of supervision that pretended to be coincidence — three meters, line of sight, the kind of proximity that said: I'm shopping, and also: I can cross this distance in under a second if necessary.

He was examining a jian. Holding it wrong — deliberately, testing the balance from an unconventional grip, the kind of experimentation that said: I know how this is supposed to be held, and I'm interested in what happens when it isn't. The vendor watched with the patience of someone who had seen many boys hold swords. Their patience was calibrated to the probability of sale. Their probability was declining with every unconventional grip.

"Good blade."

Not Wei. Behind him. A voice — young, warm, the temperature of friendliness that was too consistent to be spontaneous. Like a fire that had been set deliberately. Their deliberateness was invisible if you weren't looking for the match.

I looked.

A young man. Early twenties. Clean — the kind of clean that was a project, not an accident. His clothes were simple but fitted, the tailoring of someone who had access to quality and chose to understate it. Their understatement was itself a statement. His smile: present. Constant. The smile of someone for whom smiling was infrastructure, not expression.

"Too heavy for your frame, though," he continued. Conversational. Light.

Wei looked at him. The assessment was fast — Wei's assessments were always fast, the reflex of someone who had learned early that evaluation preceded interaction. Their evaluation was: nonthreatening, knowledgeable, interesting.

"I know," Wei said. "That's why I'm testing the off-balance point."

The young man's smile shifted — a millimeter. From standard to engaged. The micro-expression of someone whose interest had been piqued. Their piquing was genuine where his smile was not.

"You test off-balance points?"

"How else do you know where the sword fails?"

A pause. The young man studied Wei. Not his face — his posture. His feet. His hips. The inventory of someone who was reading a body the way a physician reads symptoms: systematically, professionally, with conclusions forming behind an expression that remained pleasant.

"I'm Shen Liang."

"Wei."

"Just Wei?"

"Just Wei."

Shen Liang picked up a blade from the display. Short, light — a dao. He demonstrated a grip — casual, but the casualness was performance. His technique was excellent. Foundation-level cultivation expressed through muscle memory, through the economy of motion that came from years of repetition under competent instruction.

"Iron Lotus," he said. "We're up the valley. You've heard of us?"

"Lao Chen mentions you sometimes."

"The old swordsmith? Good blades. Better conversation." A grin. Not the smile — a grin. The distinction between the two: the grin was warmer. Also calculated, but the calculation was better hidden.

"Are you a recruiter?" Wei asked. Direct. The directness that I had tried to train out of him and that had resisted training. Their resistance was his and his was the quality and the quality was: he said what he meant.

Shen Liang laughed. The laugh of someone who had been caught doing what they were doing. Their catching was an opportunity rather than a problem.

"I'm a senior disciple. I notice talent. It's a hobby."

"That's recruitment."

"It's appreciation."

They talked. I listened from the herb stall, examining dried chrysanthemum with zero percent of my attention and one hundred percent of my perception trained on the conversation twelve feet away.

Shen Liang was good. Not good in the way that skill was good — good in the way that mirrors were good. He reflected Wei back at himself, amplified. When Wei talked about training: Shen Liang asked the right questions, the questions that made Wei feel heard. Their hearing was the technique. Their technique was seduction in its most abstract form — the seduction of relevance.

"You train alone?" Shen Liang asked.

"Mostly."

"Who taught you?"

A pause. The pause that preceded a choice — the choice of what to share and with whom and the with-whom being a stranger and strangers being the category that required caution and caution being the thing I'd taught him.

"An acquaintance."

The word landed. An acquaintance. The deliberately imprecise descriptor that said: someone, not no one, but definitely not the word I would use for what she is because what she is doesn't have a word and the wordlessness is the space and the space is the relationship and the relationship is not your business.

Shen Liang accepted it. Easy. No follow-up. The restraint of someone who recognized a boundary. Their recognition was tactical — boundaries resisted pressure but yielded to patience and patience was what he had.

"Your acquaintance taught you well."

"She's adequate."

I examined the chrysanthemum more closely. Adequate. The word he'd chosen. The word that was simultaneously a compliment — because adequate from Wei was high praise — and a diminishment, because adequate was the descriptor you used for things you'd outgrown and the outgrowing was the subtext and the subtext was audible to anyone who was listening for it and Shen Liang was listening for it.

They talked for thirty more minutes. Thirty minutes of Shen Liang being interested and interesting and interested in being interesting and Wei being fourteen and talking to someone who was not me and the not-me being the novelty and the novelty being the point.

I bought chrysanthemum. I didn't need chrysanthemum. I didn't drink chrysanthemum tea. I bought chrysanthemum because purchasing was the cover and the cover was necessary and necessary was the word that applied to my standing at a herb stall for thirty minutes pretending not to listen to a conversation that was about me without mentioning me. Their not-mentioning was accurate because I was an acquaintance and acquaintances were the things you didn't need to mention and the not-needing was the evidence and the evidence was the three steps ahead and the three steps were fine.

Fine.
