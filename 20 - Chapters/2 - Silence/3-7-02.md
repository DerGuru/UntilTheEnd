I stood up. At some point. The point was unmarked — no decision, no impulse, no trigger. The body stood because lying was not sustainable and not-sustainable was the body's limit and the limit produced standing.

The door. Outside. The bowl — cold now, the steam gone, the rice hardened at the surface. I stepped over it. Not around. Over. The trajectory of someone who did not see the bowl because the bowl was not the thing and the thing was: movement. Any direction. Away.

Past the garden.

His garden. The three pots. My peripheral vision registered them — there, present, green — and my peripheral vision was the only vision I permitted for that location because direct vision was direct engagement and direct engagement was the thing I was refusing and the refusal was the only structure remaining.

I walked.

Through the settlement. Damaged walls on both sides. People — settlers, civilians, survivors — in their doorways, at their windows, in the positions of people watching something that should not be watched but that could not be avoided because the something was walking down their street.

They moved away.

Not dramatically. Not running. The small, instinctive adjustments that bodies made in proximity to something that their bodies recognized as wrong — stepping back, pulling children closer, turning sideways. The universal vocabulary of avoidance that didn't require language or understanding but only: proximity.

Under my feet: the grass. Brown. Three paces — the radius, smaller now than the thirty paces of the discharge aftermath but present, persistent, the field of decay that accompanied me as I walked. Each step: brown behind it. Green in front. The trail of someone whose trail was death. Their death was not intentional but gravitational.

An insect: fell. Mid-flight. In my radius. Dropped from the air the way things dropped when the air itself became hostile and the hostility was: my presence. A small thing. Wings still. On the dirt.

Leaves: curling at the edges. On the trees I passed, on the bushes, on the vegetation that lined the path out of the settlement and into the forest. Not dramatic — incremental. The slow wilting that heat produced in summer and that I was producing in not-summer.

Past the east gate. Past the open ground. Past the place.

I did not look at the place. The dirt where he had lain. The spot that was marked by — what? Blood, qi-residue, the chemical evidence of a body that had discharged and fallen and lain and been. Whatever marked it. I did not look.

Into the forest. The trees — large, old, the kind of trees that had been growing before this settlement existed and that would continue growing after this settlement forgot itself. Their age was their resistance. Older biology: harder to kill. The grass died in my wake but the trees merely weakened — leaves losing rigidity, bark drying slightly, the subtle symptoms of exposure that would heal when the exposure left.

I walked. No direction. No purpose. The body moving because the body moved and the moving was the alternative to the not-moving and the not-moving was the house and the house was the bowl and the bowl was the empty room.

Away from people. Away from the settlement. Away from the barriers I had built and the signs I had carved and the walls that held and the walls holding was the proof and the proof was the thing I could not stand because the proof said: you protected everything. And everything was a lie because everything excluded him.

The forest closed behind me. The green — and then the brown path that I left. The trail of dead grass and curled leaves that said: someone came this way. And the someone was the thing that killed what she walked through.

I walked.
