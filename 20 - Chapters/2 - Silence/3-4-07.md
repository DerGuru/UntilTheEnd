Night.

The settlement slept. Post-celebration sleep â€” deeper, heavier, the rest that followed relief and food and firelight. Earned and total.

Wei slept. His face: peaceful. The peace of someone who had saved twenty-seven people and stabilized a qi-source and been celebrated and was now processing all of it through unconsciousness.

His core.

I knelt. The arrangement. Knees, floor, hand, the gap. The ritual that had become the architecture of my nights and that was producing data I filed, and the filing said: worse, getting worse, the progression continues.

Flicker.

Not the steady glow of his core at rest â€” the unsteady, visible, through-the-shirt flicker. The core not resting. Still resonating from today's output.

I counted.

Five.

Five twitches per minute.

Part one: three. Part two: four. Part three: four, irregular. Now: five. The numbers. The progression. Not a line â€” a curve. Upward. Accelerating. Each stage faster than the last. The intervals shortening.

I withdrew my hand.

His blanket. Higher. The care gesture. Automatic. The hands that had held the cave wall and the cold tea now performing the most basic act of care: covering a sleeping body against the cold that wasn't cold.

"Fixed it," Wei mumbled. Sleep-talking. The word surfacing from whatever dream he was in â€” victory, probably. The cave. The node. The doing.

"You did," I said. Quiet. He couldn't hear me.

"All of it." A mumble. Then nothing. The nothing of deep sleep reclaiming the consciousness that had briefly surfaced.

I went outside.

The night. The stars. The garden.

His garden. The three pots â€” recovering now from the qi-disruption. The dock grass: still wilted, but less. The nettle-cousin: sealed bloom beginning to open. The lemongrass: resilient, vertical, being correct.

Because Wei had fixed the source. Gone into the cave and channeled his qi and stabilized the flows.

He saved the fields. The harvests. The water. The headaches. He saved Frau Huang's chickens and Lao Chen's forge-fire and the unnamed grain and the dock grass and the nettle-cousin.

He saved everything.

The word from the memory. The man, the city, the square that would be named. He saved everything.

And the saving was the cost. And the cost was the core. And the core was the clock.

*Five twitches. Accelerating. The curve suggestsâ€”*

I stopped.

The calculation. The forecast. The number that the curve produced when I extended it.

I drank my tea. Cold. The swallow of liquid that served as interruption. The trick that worked because the body's involvement in swallowing broke the thought-chain, and the thought-chain needed breaking.

Stars. Indifferent. The stars that had been there for the man in the city and would be there for the boy in the settlement. Continuity as cruelty. The universe not caring.

I was not supposed to care either. The thing I was â€” the thing I had been â€” had included something close to indifference in its design. But the design was old and I was no longer what I had been.

I cared.

The word. The admission. Quiet, nighttime, made to the garden and the stars and the tea and to no one.

I cared about the boy. His core. The five and the curve and the trajectory. The grin and the scar and the hip correction and the victory and the voice that had shifted.

You were the one who taught me what that word meant. Not the concept. The cost.

And caring was the problem. Because caring without acting was the torture that the principle imposed. And acting without his permission was the violation that caring prevented. And the paradox â€” care demands action, principle prohibits it â€” was the architecture of my nights: standing in a garden with cold tea and five twitches per minute and the thought I wouldn't finish.

His proudest day. His most dangerous day. And he would never know they were the same day.

The garden. The pots. The stones.

Morning would come. He would wake. He would be proud and tired and fourteen and the world would call him hero and heroism would feed the core and the core would tick.

Five. Per minute.

The night held.
