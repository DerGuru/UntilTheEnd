Night.

"Yun?" His voice already half-dissolved by sleep.

"What."

"Was it good? The fight?"

I looked at him. The scar on his shoulder — thirty hours old. Already part of him.

"You survived," I said. "That's the standard."

"Terrible standard." He smiled without opening his eyes. Then the smile softened, and softened further, and was sleep.

The sleep that followed victory — deeper, heavier, the dense quality of a body that had fought and won and celebrated and that now processed all three through the medium of unconsciousness and the unconsciousness being the reward.

His face: relaxed. The scar visible above the blanket — already integrated into the visual syntax of: this is Wei, this is what Wei has done, this is the evidence.

I knelt.

The nightly arrangement. Knees on floor, hand hovering, the two-centimeter gap. The ritual that had become routine and the routine that had become the architecture of my nights — the structure that organized the hours between his sleep and his waking into: monitor, count, worry about the word I chose, catalog, worry about the word I used.

His core.

Like a small star. That was the image — the comparison that my perception produced and that was not metaphor but description. A star: a point-source of light emitting at frequencies that were visible in the qi-spectrum and that were warm and golden and persistent and that were, in the most literal sense available, luminous.

The glow pushed through his shirt. Through the fabric, through the threads, through the material barrier that was supposed to be opaque and that wasn't opaque to this and to the this being the frequency that his core emitted and the frequency being the pitch and the pitch climbing and the climbing being the data and the data being the count.

I counted.

Three.

Four.

Three.

Four.

Irregular.

New.

The irregularity was the new information. The twitches — the micro-contractions of his core's stability, the moments when the smooth pulse of healthy qi-output stuttered — had been consistent. A rhythm. Two per minute, then three per minute, then four per minute. Regular, predictable, the kind of escalation that could be tracked and forecast because regularity was the gift that data gave to those who measured and the measurement was mine.

This — the alternating, the three-four-three-four — was not regular. Was not rhythm. Was compensation failing — the body's attempt to maintain equilibrium shifting from instinct to effort, from the body's quiet self-correction to something labored and deliberate, from the effortless keeping-things-stable that healthy cores performed to the labored, irregular, visible effort of a body that was working harder to produce the same result and the harder-working being the evidence and the evidence being—

I pulled my hand back.

He shifted. Murmured something — a half-word, sleep-blurred, that might have been my name.

"I'm here," I said. The reflex of a thousand bedsides.

He settled. His breathing evened.

His blanket. I tucked it. Higher. Around his shoulders, around his chest, the careful wrapping that was the care gesture and the care gesture being the physical expression of the thing I couldn't say and the thing being the count and the count being the data and the data being the trajectory and the trajectory being the word I wouldn't finish.

Like tucking a child. Like tucking everyone. I had done this a thousand times. More. The gesture of someone who had been beside beds for longer than beds had existed in their current form — who had tucked furs and blankets and woven mats and whatever the era provided for the covering of sleeping bodies and the covering being the act and the act being the continuity and the continuity being: this is what I do. I stay. I cover. I watch.

I went outside.

Moon. Stars. The settlement: dark, except for the ember-glow of banked fires and the light from one window three houses down where Lao Chen was probably talking to a blade and the blade was probably not responding and the not-responding being the condition and the condition being: metal does not talk back, which is its appeal.

The garden. Three pots. Moonlit. The dock grass, the nettle-cousin, the lemongrass. Vertical, committed, wrong-wrong-right, the botanical arrangement that was Wei's work. Their work was the evidence and the evidence was the garden and the garden was the proof.

Two stones. The blade fragment. Moon on metal.

I stood.

Breathed. The breath of someone who didn't need to breathe. Their breathing was therefore the choice and the choice being the performance of humanity and the performance being the comfort and the comfort being: if I breathe, I am here, and here is the garden, and the garden has three pots, and the pots have plants, and the plants are his.

*Irregular. That's new. Irregular means his core is no longer compensating evenly. The overload is distributing unevenly across the qi-channels. That means—*

I lifted my tea. Cold. Drank. The cold liquid moving through a body that didn't need it. Their not-needing was irrelevant because the ritual needed it and the ritual was the structure and the structure was the night.

*That means the fracture lines are developing asymmetrically. It means when the break comes it won't be clean. It won't be a shutdown. It will be—*

I stopped.

Stars. This latitude, this season, this night. Indifferent. The indifference of light that had traveled for years to arrive at a garden where a woman stood with cold tea and a count and a thought she wouldn't finish.

*Wei is different. He must be different.*

*Everyone I've lost was different.*

*You said that once. "I'm different." You meant it. So did I.*

That one arrived uninvited. The thought that I hadn't planned and hadn't authorized and that came from the place where unauthorized thoughts lived, which was: the truth. The unrehearsed, unedited truth that existed beneath the principles and the philosophies and the gambles and that said: you have been here before and before is the pattern and the pattern is the prediction and the prediction is the thing you're holding and holding is the weight and the weight is the night and the night is long.

I drank my tea. Watched the stars. Watched the garden. Watched the settlement sleep.

Inside: the small star. His core. Glowing, twitching, three-four-three-four, irregular, bright, beautiful.

I stayed.

Then — between one breath and the next — five.

Not three-four. Five. A single spike, sharp and bright and wrong, before the pattern resumed its broken rhythm. As if the five had never happened.

It had happened.

I set down my tea. Went inside. Knelt beside him again.

His face: peaceful. His core: three. Four. Three. Four. Steady again. Almost convincing.

"How long," I whispered. Not to him. Not a question — a question expects an answer. This expected nothing. This was weight, shaped like words.

His core pulsed. The small star burned. And somewhere in the space between three and four and five, the night held its breath.

I held mine with it.
