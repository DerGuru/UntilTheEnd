Market day.

The larger settlement — two hours east, bigger streets, actual buildings with second floors. The kind of infrastructure that said: people have stayed here long enough to invest in vertical expansion.

Wei walked ahead. Three steps. The distance that used to be one.

Stalls. Spices — cinnamon, star anise, something pungent that smelled like ambition. Fabrics — silk, linen, the rough-weave cotton that Wei had worn until three weeks ago when he'd traded for a marginally less rough shirt. Weapons — swords, polearms, farming tools that could become weapons with sufficient intention.

People. Loud, pressing, normal. Bodies in proximity, transactions as the organizing principle.

Wei haggled — badly. He understood the concept but not the execution: he knew the price named was not the price meant but lacked the patience for the theater of negotiation. He overpaid by forty percent. The vendor's face suggested a conscience in brief, losing conflict with his income.

"You paid too much," I said.

"It's a good blade stone." He held it up, turning it in the light. "Feel the grain."

"I can see the grain from here. You still paid too much."

"Then next time you haggle."

I wouldn't. He knew I wouldn't. The exchange was a draw.

He tried fruit. Paid first — then tried. The sequence I'd taught him, the order of operations that separated transaction from theft.

"These are good." He held up something round and green. "Want one?"

"No."

He bought two anyway. The generosity of someone who understood that "no" was sometimes a word and not an answer.

A cart pushed through the aisle — too wide for the gap between stalls, driven by an old man who didn't care. Crates shifted. A stack of ceramic bowls on the nearest table wobbled, and the vendor lunged for them, swearing. One bowl escaped. Hit the ground. The crack was clean and final.

Wei caught the second one. Reflexes — fast, instinctive, the kind of fast that drew attention. He set the bowl down gently.

"Thanks," the vendor said, still swearing at the cart driver's back.

Wei grinned at me. The grin of someone who had done something useful and wanted credit.

I gave him nothing. He didn't need it.

Then: the problem.

His qi.

He dampened it — he knew how, had known for months, the technique I'd shown him that compressed his signature into something that didn't broadcast to every qi-sensitive being within three hundred meters. But dampening required concentration. And concentration was competing with: the sword vendor who had a blade with a wave pattern; the herb stall where he recognized lemongrass and pointed it out as though I hadn't identified it from twelve meters; the old woman selling dumplings whose steam was a sensory event; the boy — his age, maybe younger — demonstrating a basic form with a practice sword and doing it wrong in ways that Wei catalogued and almost corrected. The almost-correction was visible in the twitch of his hands.

He forgot.

Not all at once. Gradually. The dampening thinned. His qi expanded — not like a wave, nothing dramatic. Like a candle whose shade has been lifted. A slow, warm brightening that was invisible to normal perception and absolutely visible to anyone with cultivation.

I felt the first look at the weapon stall.

A woman. Middle-aged, sect robes — Inner Disciple level, maybe higher. Her eyes shifted to Wei the way a compass needle shifts to north: automatically, with the precision of something responding to a force rather than a choice. She looked. Calculated. Looked away.

The second: a man at the fabric stall. Young, cultivation concealed but present — Foundation stage, the kind of practitioner who moved through markets as surveillance rather than shopping. His attention snagged on Wei like cloth on a nail. Held. Released — deliberately, the kind of deliberate that said: I've noted this.

Someone brushed past Wei at the spice stall. Close. Closer than the crowd required. His shoulder clipped Wei's arm and Wei stepped sideways — not afraid, just surprised — and the man kept walking without turning. Foundation stage. The brush had been intentional. A proximity read. Checking Wei's qi the way you'd test a melon by pressing it.

I memorized his face. His gait. The scar on his left hand.

The third presence: harder to place. At the periphery — not visible, not stall-bound, just there. Professional attention.

Three. Three qi-sensitive beings who had noticed my boy between the sword stall and the dumpling vendor.

"The dumplings here are terrible," Wei announced, mouth full.

"You're eating your fourth."

"Terrible doesn't mean bad. It means they could be better." He chewed thoughtfully. "Different category."

"That is not a different category."

He ate a fifth.

The weapon-stall woman: forty, sect robes, silver thread at the collar — Iron Lotus or adjacent. The fabric-stall man: twenty-five, no visible affiliation, Foundation stage, surveillance posture. The peripheral presence: classification pending.

Wei moved on. Oblivious. He could identify a quality blade at ten paces but not a surveillance operative at thirty. Priorities.

A spice vendor — qi-sensitive, rudimentary — stepped back as Wei passed. A small step. Involuntary. The physical retreat of a body responding to a presence that was too bright for casual proximity.

Wei didn't notice.

I did.

"Can we come back next week?" he asked, holding two bags — herbs, a blade-polishing stone, something wrapped in paper that he wouldn't show me.

"Maybe."

"That means yes."

It didn't. But he was right that my maybes had been trending toward yes.

We walked home. Him three steps ahead. The fruit — both of them — in my hand, because he'd put them there when I wasn't paying attention. My not-paying-attention was a lie. His putting was care, and care was the thing he did now that he didn't need to receive it anymore.

Behind us: three gazes. Remembered. Catalogued. Filed.

Not shared.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Event:Reflection ratio rebalanced (~25:75 → ~50:50) by cutting analytical cascades ("and the X was the Y" chains, "the kind of X that Y" constructions) and adding concrete market events
- Fixed [HIGH]: Added 4 new dialog exchanges (blade stone haggling, bowl-catching beat, dumpling banter) — total now 6+
- Fixed [HIGH]: Added 3 external events: runaway cart / bowl catch, intentional shoulder-brush qi-read, dumpling scene
- Applied Global Patterns: Cut recursive pronoun chains, "Not because...but because" cascades, meta-commentary on narrative itself; preserved Yun's terse observational voice
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The shoulder-brush qi-read replaces a paragraph of analytical reflection with a physical threat that conveys the same danger more viscerally.
