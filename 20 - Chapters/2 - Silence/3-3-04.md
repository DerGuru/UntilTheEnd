Third round.

The lynx came low â€” a different approach, the adaptation of a predator that had learned from two exchanges that high attacks were met with evasion. Low was the angle this target hadn't defended. Animals learned fast when qi-enhanced. The intelligence wasn't human but it was sufficient.

Wei adjusted. Too late. The adjustment happened but delayed by the fraction of a second between anticipation and reaction, and the fraction was the gap, and the gap was the claw.

It hit.

Paw across shoulder. Diagonal. Deep.

The sound: fabric tearing, then something wetter. Skin separating under force. I heard it from eight meters with the clarity of someone whose perception was designed for detail and was currently producing nausea.

Blood. Immediate. Red, hot, vivid.

Wei screamed.

Short. One syllable. His body had been breached and the pain was a surprise because pain was always a surprise, even when you'd trained for it, because the training was theoretical and the pain was not.

Then: silence. His jaw closed. Teeth together. He chose to stop screaming and the choosing was willpower and the willpower was his.

He didn't step back.

That was the thing. He didn't retreat. His left arm â€” the struck arm, bleeding shoulder to elbow â€” hung. His right arm came up. Qi concentrated in the right palm. Bright. Brighter than before. The brightness of emergency, of a body that was hurt and responding by pushing harder.

The lynx recovered. Turned. Came again.

Wei met it.

Right palm forward. A qi-pulse â€” not trained modulation but raw, unfiltered discharge. A fourteen-year-old whose left shoulder was open and whose right hand was everything.

It hit the lynx. Square. Center mass.

The animal staggered. A real stagger â€” not annoyance but physical disruption. A qi-strike powered by pain and the fuel that only desperation provided.

The lynx shook. Its qi-lines flickered â€” visible disruption. For two seconds, maybe three, the animal's enhancement wavered.

Wei pressed. Another strike. Same hand. Same arm. Channeling anything he had, expensive and unsustainable, maintaining it because it was the only option.

"Stay back," he said. Through his teeth. To me. Without looking.

The lynx retreated. Two steps. Three. Its posture shifted â€” from predator to uncertain. A territorial animal encountering something it couldn't categorize: a bleeding boy whose qi was too bright.

I stood. Eight meters. My mouth: full of blood. My palms: crescent wounds from fingernails. My feet: planted, rooted, preventing myself from moving by making my body heavy.

Wei looked at me.

One glance. From across the clearing. Through the blood and the sweat and the torn sleeve. His eyes met mine and in his eyes was the word: no.

Not spoken. Communicated in the frequency that existed between us â€” the channel built by years of proximity and silence.

*I can do this.*

I stayed.

The cost of staying was the blood on my tongue and the crescents in my palms. Restraint in a body built for action. Not-acting as the hardest thing I had done.

*Harder than fighting. Harder than running. Harder than any of it.*

The lynx steadied. Its qi-lines re-established. It hadn't retreated far enough. Still here. Still the fight.

Wei's left arm: dripping. Not critical yet. But accumulating.

He breathed. Set his stance. Right arm up. Left arm held close.

The lynx gathered. Muscles bunching under qi-lit fur.

Wei breathed out. Slow. Ready.
