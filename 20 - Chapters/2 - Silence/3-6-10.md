At the edge: movement.

Guo. I couldn't see him — his discipline included visual concealment — but his signature was readable and the reading was: executive function. Decision-making qi-patterns. The neurological output of a mind processing options and selecting.

He processed.

His strongest operative: the one closest to me, the one who had been part of the four-point killbox, the one who had survived Wei's discharge — was on the ground. Not from the discharge. From me. From the emission. His qi-channels: destabilized. His body: rejecting equilibrium. He was crawling away on his hands and knees and the crawling was the diagnosis: too close for too long.

Guo calculated.

Not emotionally. Not with the weight that calculation carried for people who felt. With the functionality of a mind that had been trained to optimize outcomes. Their optimization was: resource expenditure against gain, risk against extraction, the arithmetic of operations that included the variable labeled "acceptable losses."

He klopfte.

Three times. Against something — his signal board, his thigh, the surface that his unit recognized. Three knocks. Clear, rhythmic, final. The same pattern that had triggered the trap, the same cadence that had sent Wei running toward the false scout. Same rhythm. Different meaning.

Retreat.

The signatures: responding. Pulling back. East, south, north — the formations dissolving, the bodies that had been positioned with precision departing with precision. The discipline of an organized withdrawal that was not panic but planning. They left the way they had arrived: as a unit.

Two of them did not leave.

Close to me. Inside the radius. Inside the dead grass at its outer edge. Two operatives who had been too near when the emission started. Their nearness was now the liability because the liability was: their commander was leaving and they were not attached to the leaving because leaving required moving and moving required functioning and functioning required being outside the radius.

Guo looked — I inferred the looking from the signature's orientation. A pause. One second. Two. The duration of a commander acknowledging that two of his people were being left behind and the acknowledging being neither grief nor regret but notation. Filed. Moved past.

He turned. Walked. His signature: receding through the treeline, through the positions his unit had held, toward the distance that would absorb him and his people and their operation into the larger pattern of things that came and went. Their going was the only certainty.

He left them.

The two. In the grass. One: barely conscious, the nausea having progressed to systemic qi-disruption. The other: conscious, aware, trying to move but the inner ear was gone and moving without the inner ear was the challenge that produced crawling in circles.

They would not survive the radius. Not by violence — by exposure. The emission was not lethal by design but it was lethal by duration and the duration was: I was still standing. Still leaking. Still the furnace that burned everything near it because the furnace did not know how to stop burning and the not-knowing was the condition and the condition was permanent for now.

I stayed. In the circle. With the body.

The two operatives: in the periphery. Dying slowly, or not dying slowly, the distinction dependent on whether I stayed and how long and whether the emission decreased and whether the decrease was—

I stayed.

---

The western hill. The signature: retreating.

The Immortal+. The Hermit Master. He had watched. From 200 paces. Through the entire engagement — the combat, the trap, the death, the silence, the verdorren. He had watched the way beings of our magnitude watched: with full perception, full comprehension, and the distance that was not cowardice but calibration.

He could have intervened. He could have crossed the distance, entered the fight, stopped the four cultivators, prevented. He could have.

He didn't. Because intervention was the thing that beings of our magnitude did not do in the affairs of beings who were not of our magnitude. Because the policy was old and the old was the wisdom and the wisdom was: you don't interfere. You watch. You carry the weight of watching, and the weight of watching is the lighter weight, and the lighter weight is the one that doesn't collapse the world beneath it.

He was leaving because staying was expensive.

Not in qi. In exposure. My emission: detectable. Dangerous, even to an Immortal+. Not lethal — not at 200 paces, not with his defenses — but uncomfortable in the way that proximity to grief at my scale was uncomfortable. Like standing too close to a star. The star didn't target you. The star was the star. And you moved.

He moved. No gesture this time. No two-finger salute, no acknowledgment, no departure ritual. Just: gone. The signature: receding up the hill, over the ridge, into the distance.

An Immortal+ retreating from a woman standing in dead grass.

Not from power. From grief.

The settlement: settling. The combat: over. The qi-blasts: silent. The fire at the south-west: burning itself out or being extinguished by the settlers who had followed Wei's instruction and gone south with buckets.

The walls: intact. My barriers: holding. The protection signs: still glowing faintly. The escape routes: functional, used, successful. The civilians: alive. The settlement: standing.

Everything I had protected: standing.

Everything except.

The body in the dirt. At the center of dead grass. At the center of silence.

The two operatives in the periphery: I didn't watch them. Whatever happened to them — what the radius did, whether they crawled far enough, whether the exposure was lethal or only debilitating — I didn't track. They existed in the category of things that were happening that were not the thing and the thing was: the body. His body.

In the world that I had built. The barriers, the signs, the routes, the walls that bore my qi and that held. The world that I had protected. Everything. Except.

Except the one thing I should have protected and didn't because protecting it would have meant admitting it mattered and admitting it mattered would have meant opening the door and the door was the door I kept shut because behind the door was love and behind love was loss and behind loss was this:

A dead boy in dirt.

Fourteen. Hands torn. Core dark. Eyes open to the grey sky.

The grass around him: dead.

The sky above him: indifferent.

The woman beside him: standing.
