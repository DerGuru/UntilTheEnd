Morning. Grey again.

The settlement existed. Damaged — the east wall cracked where the qi-blasts had hit, the south-west corner charred where the fire had burned, two roofs caved from the shockwave that Wei's discharge had produced. But standing. The barriers hummed. The protection signs glowed in the grey light, faint but functional.

Wei did not exist.

The garden. His garden. Three pots in a row. Clay, unevenly shaped — he'd made them himself, pressed and dried in the sun behind the house. The blade fragment at the edge. The two grey-blue stones that he'd found interesting for reasons he'd explained once and that I had not retained because not retaining was not the problem.

The herbs. The dock grass: wrong. The nettle-cousin: wrong. The lemongrass: right, by accident, the one success in a row of failures that he'd treated no differently from the failures because treating them differently was not his method and his method was: equal attention, equal water, equal stubbornness.

They were alive. The herbs. Green in the grey morning, growing in pots made by hands that were now torn and still and cold in the dirt outside the east gate.

The herbs grew. He didn't.

Lao Chen's workshop. Across the path. The door: open. Not forced — open, the way it had been left by someone who left quickly and who left the door because the door was irrelevant when everything behind it was already complete.

Inside: the workbench. Clean. Organized. Tools in their positions — hammer here, tongs there, files arranged by size. The forge: cold. Not recently cold — the coldness of a fire that had been out for hours. Permanent.

The grindstone: wet.

Still wet. Recently used — the water had not yet evaporated. He was here. Working. Sharpening. And then he stopped. And Lao Chen was gone.

Not dead. Not killed. Gone. Evacuated, or departed, or removed himself from a place that contained a dead boy and an empty forge and a woman whose proximity killed grass. Gone the way craftsmen went when the workshop was no longer the workshop but the reminder.

The wet grindstone: evidence of his last act. What had he sharpened? Not what — when. Recently. Before the battle, during the battle, after. The stone said: I was used. The user said: I am elsewhere.

Footsteps. Outside. The weight and rhythm of someone who walked heavily and who walked because stopping was not an option and options were the luxury she did not have.

Frau Huang.

She came around the side of the house. A bowl in her hands. Ceramic. The same kind of bowl she'd used for years — practical, unchipped, the cookware of a woman who maintained her kitchen the way she maintained her children: loudly and completely.

Rice. Vegetables. Simple. The meal that required no ceremony because ceremony was the thing that the morning did not permit.

She set the bowl at the door.

She did not knock. Did not call. Did not shout — and the absence of shouting was the thing, the absence that defined this moment because Frau Huang shouted. That was her nature, her method, her characteristic. The Loud Mother. The woman whose volume was the settlement's weather.

She was silent.

Behind her: Shen. Her son. Twelve. The boy who didn't hear well and who had followed Wei through the gate and who had been pushed backward by hands that were now torn. That push was the reason he stood here — alive, present, shaking.

He was quiet. The boy who didn't hear: quiet. For the first time. Not the quiet of someone choosing not to speak but the quiet of someone whose capacity for sound had been altered by proximity to the sound of a core shattering.

He had seen it. Fifteen paces. Wei's discharge. The light. The ugly, raw, non-golden light. He had seen it and the seeing was inside him now and the inside was the place where sound used to live and the sound had been replaced by what he'd seen.

Frau Huang looked at the door. At the bowl. At the empty space that Yun would have occupied if Yun were occupying spaces.

She stood.

The expression on her face: not gratitude, not grief, not the named emotion that people expected from mothers whose sons had been saved by boys who died. Something else. The expression of someone who understood — not the qi, not the cultivation, not the cosmic architecture of the situation — but the mathematics. The simple, human arithmetic of: one died so that another lived. And the one who died was fourteen. And the one who lived was hers.

She stood there with that arithmetic on her face. Unpayable. I know.

Then she went. Back the way she came. Her son following. Their footsteps receding.

The bowl at the door. Steam rising. The temperature differential between hot food and cold morning producing visible condensation that would diminish and diminish and stop.

Inside: I had not moved. For hours. Since when — I did not track. The house was a room. The room contained absence. Shaped like a person who was not in it.

The bowl grew cold.
