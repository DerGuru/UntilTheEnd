We found the child in the early afternoon, at the point where the trail descended to a floodplain and the river spread wide and shallow over stones smoothed by centuries of water.

It was sitting by the river, feet dangling in the water, staring at the current. It was small. Four, maybe five. Dirty. Eyes that had already seen too much.

She sat on the bank. Alone. No adults in sight — not hidden, not nearby, not coming. Alone in the absolute sense. Thin and dirty. The clothes had been someone else's once — too large, torn, worn past poverty into abandonment.

Wei saw her first. Stopped. I felt the change in his qi before I saw his posture shift, a sharpening, a focusing.

"We take her with us."

Not a question. Not a request. A declaration. The tone Wei used when he'd made a decision before the conversation started and was informing rather than consulting.

"No."

He turned. The look. I'd catalogued this look. Category 4: moral outrage, controlled. The kind that didn't explode but burned. Hotter than the explosive kind. More sustained.

"She's alone."

"Yes."

"She'll die here."

"Maybe."

"*Maybe?*"

I met his eyes and held them.

"We can't. We're being tracked. She'd slow us down. She'd make us visible. She'd need food we are already low on and care we can't provide. She'd be in danger she doesn't deserve because of a situation she didn't create."

Every word was true. Every word was a weapon.

Wei's jaw set. The muscle in his cheek flexed and held.

"So we just leave her."

"I didn't say that."

"What then?"

I looked at the girl by the river. At the smallness of her. At her stillness — not calm, not patience, but the inertia of someone who had stopped expecting.

"There's a farm. Half a li south. I saw smoke from the chimney this morning."

Wei looked at me. Looked at the girl. Looked south.

He walked to the child. Crouched. Said something I didn't bother to hear — low, gentle, the voice he used with animals and children and, on rare occasions, with me.

The girl stood. Looked up at Wei and took his hand.

They walked south. I followed.

The farm was small — a stone house, a garden, a few scrawny chickens maintaining the fiction of agriculture. A man came out. Middle-aged. The face of someone who had developed an opinion about endurance and whose opinion was negative.

"What?" the farmer said.

"She needs a home." Direct. Wei's negotiation style: moral clarity as substitute for diplomacy.

The farmer looked at the girl. At Wei. At me. At the girl again.

"Not mine."

"I know."

"Food's tight."

Wei reached into his pack. His hand found the pouch, the thin leather fold that contained everything we had in currency. He opened it. Inside: one coin. The last one.

He held it out.

"Look after her."

The farmer took the coin. Looked at it. Looked at the girl. Looked at the coin again.

"Come on, then," the farmer said to the girl. Not warmly but not cruelly either.

The girl went. Without looking back. Without releasing Wei's hand until the farmer's hand replaced it — a pause. Two hands. Then one.

Wei stood. Watched the girl walk into the house. The door closed.

He turned. Walked past me. Back to the trail. His pack lighter by one coin and his expression heavier by something coins couldn't measure.

"That's not enough." Quarter of a li later. Not to me — to the trail, to the air. "One coin. That's nothing."

"It's what we had."

"It's not enough."

"No."

We walked. The river sound faded. Wei's hands, empty now, freed of the last material thing he'd possessed beyond the clothes and the pack, didn't shake. For the first time in days, perfectly still.

I noticed. Filed it but didn't comment.

The stillness lasted until nightfall. The tremor returned. And the stream flowed. The coin sat in a farmer's pocket, and Wei walked with empty hands and a full core.

He would carry that. I knew, with the certainty of someone who had watched thousands of people learn this lesson and who had never seen anyone put it down.
