Wei walked through a village that showed him what silence looked like from the outside.

It was his first time outside in four days, his legs still finding the rhythm of movement, his body recalibrating with every step as the qi in his channels adjusted to the mechanics of walking. He moved carefully. Not because he was weak, but because everything felt new. The ground under his feet had texture he'd never noticed. The air had weight. Sunlight wasn't just warm — it had layers, frequencies, a spectrum of energy that pressed against his skin like something alive. And Everything had qi.

He walked through the village and nobody greeted him.

The fisher, who'd shown him how to tie nets and called him "kid" and cuffed him gently on the back of the head when he dropped a knot — the fisher saw Wei coming and turned away. Not fast. Not panicked. Just — turned. Redirected his attention to a net that didn't need mending.

"Uncle Chen?" Wei's voice carried across the space between them. Clear. Steady. The greeting of someone who hadn't yet understood why it wouldn't be returned. "I wanted to ask about the—"

The fisher's hands moved faster on the net. That was all. That was enough.

Mrs. Zhao, whose shoulder I'd accidentally helped during the healing, was sitting outside her door. She saw Wei, stood, and went inside. The door didn't slam — it closed. Quietly, carefully, the precise closure of someone who doesn't want to be rude but wants very much to be on the other side of a wall.

Two children ran when he approached — the quick, instinctive retreat of small animals who had absorbed the anxiety of the adults around them and translated it into motion. Their mother appeared in a doorway, gathered them, vanished.

"I'm not going to—" Wei said to the empty doorway. The sentence had nowhere to land, so it didn't.

Wei stopped in the village center. The well was behind him. The granary ahead. The paths that radiated outward to the fields and the river and the forest — empty. All of them. The village had arranged itself around his absence, created a buffer zone with him at its center, and was maintaining it with the coordinated precision of an organism avoiding a toxin.

I watched from thirty meters away. Leaning against the wall of the hut. Arms crossed.

Wei stood there. In the center of the silence. His hands were at his sides and they were shaking and he was pretending they weren't.

"What did I do?"

He said it to no one. To the empty square. To the closed doors and shuttered windows and the absence of a single human being willing to stand in the same space as a boy whose eyes now flickered with something that wasn't quite light.

He turned. Looked at me across the thirty meters. His face was — I want to say angry, but that's not right. The betrayal had no source, no target, nowhere to go except inward, where it would calcify into something harder and more permanent than anger.

"Is it always going to be like this?" he asked. Across the distance. Not loud — but in that silence, a whisper would have carried to the next village.

I held his gaze. Said nothing. The wind moved the grass between us and it was not enough.

"Fine," he said. The word was a door closing.

He walked back to the hut and sat on the doorstep without a word. His hands shook in his lap and he clasped them together and pressed them between his knees and held them until they stopped.

The wind moved the grass. A door creaked, somewhere. Nobody opened it.
