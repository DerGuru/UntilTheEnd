The breakthrough happened at a river.

We'd descended from the mountain range into a valley — warmer, greener. Terrain that existed between ranges like the spaces between sentences, providing the pause that made the next climb bearable. A river ran through it, clean and cold, wide enough to be impressive and shallow enough to be crossable.

Wei meditated at the bank. Standard morning routine — the sequence I'd prescribed weeks ago, integrated into his day automatically, daily, without question.

He sat cross-legged. Eyes closed. Breathing: three and three. The standard pattern.

Then the click.

I felt it from ten meters away — not with my ears, with qi-perception. A sharp, definitive shift. His qi compressed, cohered, reorganized his entire channel architecture in a single contraction.

Foundation Establishment — middle phase. Nine days from early phase. Standard timeline: three to six months.

He opened his eyes, bright, and grinned.

The full grin. Unreserved, unmodulated. A boy who has just experienced success and wants the world to know.

"I'm getting better."

He leaped up. Qi-steps across the river — faster than before, lighter, the movement's relationship to gravity fundamentally renegotiated. He cleared the width in two bounds, landed on the opposite bank, and laughed.

Laughed. The first real laugh since the village. Full-bodied, unself-conscious.

"Did you see that? Two steps!"

"I saw."

"Two STEPS, Yun. Across a river."

"I know."

He bounded back. Grinning. Dripping. His landing had been less precise than his takeoff — one foot in the shallows, water sloshing over his ankle.

"Hm."

A nine-day advancement through a three-to-six-month phase was not fast. It was not impressive. It was wrong. It works, until it doesn't, and the failure mode is not gradual.

He bounded back and forth across the river. Grinning. Alive.

I watched him. The grin was real. The speed underneath it was not.
