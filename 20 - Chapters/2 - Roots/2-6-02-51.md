The door opened, and the past walked in.

A young man. Eighteen, nineteen. Thin — thinner than thin. Hollow-cheeked. Sunken-eyed. The face of someone who had been consuming himself for fuel because the environment had stopped providing.

His clothes had been expensive once. Layered, embroidered — sect clothing, representing investment as much as identity. Now: torn, stained. The memory of quality preserved in the cut and destroyed in the condition.

His walk. Unsteady. Each step a negotiation between the desire to move forward and the body's growing case that forward was a direction it could no longer afford.

His qi — I felt its absence. His core was damaged, degraded, running at a fraction of design capacity. Not shattered — but cracked. The distinction mattered. Shattered cores died. Cracked cores leaked.

Xu Ran.

The genius who had tried to ascend. Who had triggered a tribulation. Who had brought the sky down on a village where a boy and a woman lived. Whose core had cracked.

The merchant's *broken core, traveling this road*. I hadn't expected a face. Not this one.

I froze. Internally — a stillness beneath the surface, the activation of a baseline alertness I hadn't used in weeks.

Wei felt it. Sitting beside me, close enough that changes in my internal state reached his perception.

"Who's that?" Quiet. Under the room noise.

I didn't answer.

Xu Ran crossed to the counter. Spoke to Pig Nose. The gesture was universal: a hand extended, a request for shelter.

He placed a coin. It wasn't a coin — it was a core fragment. A piece of himself, physically extracted. Crystallized qi, dark-gold, compressed beyond gaseous state into material. Pig Nose didn't know what it was. But took it anyway.

Xu Ran received a bowl. He sat with his back to the wall and ate mechanically — his eyes elsewhere.

"Yun." Wei, again. Closer. "You know him?"

"Eat your noodles."

He ate, watched me watch and filed everything — every micro-expression, every piece of the puzzle I was refusing to assemble.

We sat. Eight meters from a cracked core paying for soup with pieces of himself.
