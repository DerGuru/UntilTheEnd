I waited until he slept.

It took longer than usual.

"You're staring," he said from his bedroll. Eyes half-closed, voice already thick with the gravity of sleep.

"I'm thinking."

"You can think without staring."

"Go to sleep, Wei."

A pause. The fire crackled. An owl said something unhelpful in the distance.

"You'll still be here when I wake up?"

"Where would I go?"

He considered this. Found it sufficient. His breathing changed, slower, deeper, the surrender of a body that trusted its surroundings enough to stop guarding them. Within a minute, he was gone.

Then I tried again.

Meditation. The deep kind: full-immersion inward focus I hadn't used in decades because the concentration it demanded left the physical world unmonitored. A luxury I'd stopped affording when I'd acquired something worth protecting.

But Wei was asleep. The ambient field was clear. The scouts were behind us, two days minimum. The window was as wide as it would get.

I closed my eyes. Pulled inward.

Down. Past the surface flows. Past the middle channels. Past the secondary meridians and the auxiliary systems I'd built and refined across millennia. Down to the core. The source-point from which everything radiated.

I focused on the output. The stream.

There — a thread of energy, thin as spider silk and dense as bedrock, extending from my core through my channels through the air into his. A conduit.

Not new.

The thread was worn smooth, embedded, the way a rope wears into the stone it rests against. I traced it backward through the timeline my qi-system recorded in strata.

Months. Since the first week at Lianshan. Since the first night he'd slept within range of my field. Since before I'd known his name.

The stream had been flowing since Wei was twelve. Since a boy had sat down next to a woman on a porch and refused to leave.

I held the thread. Gripped it with the focused intention of millennia of qi-mastery, the deepest, most absolute control I could bring to bear.

I pulled.

The thread yielded. Slowly. My qi didn't want to let go. Not conscious want, physical want. The thread was part of how I operated. Removing it wasn't suppression. It was amputation.

First breath. The thread thinned. The flow to Wei's core diminished.

Second breath. Pulled harder. My channels protested, a deep ache below the threshold of pain.

Third breath. Sweat. On my forehead. On my palms. On places that hadn't produced moisture since before the current dynasty's great-grandfather was born. The body's admission that what the mind was attempting exceeded its parameters.

Fourth breath. The thread was gossamer. Almost nothing. Wei's core vibrated — uncertain, decelerating.

One more breath. One more second.

Fifth breath.

The thread snapped back.

Not gradually. BACK. Full width, full density, full flow — and more. The suppression had loaded it. Compressed. A concentrated burst that hit Wei's channels like a wave hitting a shore.

He flinched. In his sleep. His back arched — a single, involuntary spasm. His channels absorbed the burst. His core blazed — bright enough to see through his clothing, through the blanket, through the four meters of dark air between us.

Then it settled. His breathing resumed. His core dimmed. His channels balanced and he slept on, undisturbed, unaware that his teacher had just failed to save him.

I opened my eyes.

My hands were shaking. Actually shaking. Physical vibration — muscles under tension, released, unable to find the baseline that mastery was supposed to guarantee.

"Es geht nicht."

*It doesn't work.*

The admission that I could not prevent my own qi from feeding a thirteen-year-old boy whose core would break because of it.

"You're going to burn," I told him. The sleeping shape of him. The rise and fall of breathing that didn't know what it cost. "And I can't stop it."

He didn't hear me. The stream didn't pause. The night absorbed the words the way it absorbed everything — completely, without judgment, without giving anything back.

I put my hands in my lap. Waited for the shaking to stop. It took longer than it should have.

The night continued. The stream flowed. And somewhere between the tremor in my hands and the glow in his chest, the word *autonomous* surfaced — the feeling that the qi had a direction I hadn't given it and a purpose I hadn't assigned.

I buried the word.

It didn't stay buried. Nothing ever did.
