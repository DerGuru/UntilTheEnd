The merchant left us at the crossroads. Went east. We went west.

I waited until he was gone. Then I thought about what I'd heard.

Three sects. Three approaches. The Iron Lotus would follow the Black Moor trail, find nothing, and recalibrate — they didn't abandon searches, they refined them. The hermit-master operated outside institutional logic, on curiosity alone, and curiosity was the most durable fuel source in the human repertoire. And the Heaven's Order had written a letter — "We ask" — and the Heaven's Order didn't ask. If they were asking, they were afraid.

I needed distance. More than the Black Moor feint provided.

Wei was walking ahead. Fourteen steps now. The distance between us was growing at the rate of one step per day.

"Yun."

He'd stopped. Was looking back. Past me. At the road behind us.

"Someone's following."

I turned. Looked. Nothing. The road was empty.

"Nobody's following us."

"Not following. Watching."

I extended my senses. Road behind: empty. Trees: occupied by wildlife and wind and the ordinary business of ecosystems. Sky: indifferent.

Nothing.

But Wei's face. He felt something the instruments couldn't confirm.

"The trees are too even," he said.

I looked at the trees. Oak, birch, the usual northern mix. Spaced as the forest had placed them, the organic randomness of—

No.

The spacing was wrong. Subtle. The trees were evenly spaced. Symmetric. As if planted by someone who valued regularity over naturalism and whose cultivation philosophy extended to the physical world.

Heaven's Order. Their fingerprint extended to the landscape. They didn't just occupy space — they organized it. The result was a world slightly, almost imperceptibly, too tidy.

I dropped my presence. Not suppression — reduction. The way you make yourself small in a crowd by slouching, except the crowd was the ambient qi field and the slouching was a controlled contraction of spiritual resonance.

Wei watched me do it.

"What are you doing?"

"Being less visible."

"You look the same."

"Not to them."

I held his wrist. Pushed the technique through contact — a pulse, then a compression, then the hollow sensation of a presence folding in on itself. He flinched.

"That feels wrong."

"That's because you're used to projecting. This is the opposite."

He tried it. Failed. The spiritual equivalent of sucking in your stomach — the effort itself was visible.

"Again."

He tried again. Better. Still obvious, but the shape of the attempt was correct. I let him practice while we walked, correcting his posture each time — chin down, shoulders forward, steps shorter. Concealment wasn't only spiritual. It was physical.

After an hour, he could hold the compression for thirty seconds before it leaked.

"The western ranges," I said. "Into the high passes."

"Why?"

"Because wild terrain resists organization. Their symmetry doesn't survive scree fields and goat trails."

Wei looked at me. True and insufficient — that was the expression.

He turned. Walked. Fifteen steps ahead.

I matched his pace, keeping the compression active. The road stretched behind us. Organized. Patient.

But we were quieter now.
