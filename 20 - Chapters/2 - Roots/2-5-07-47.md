Days blurred. North. Always north. Hills became ridges became the foothills of mountains I hadn't intended to cross.

Wei's ribs healed. His arm recovered. The bruises faded through their spectrum — black to purple to green to the pale nothing that remained when the body had moved on.

He trained every morning. Stabilization exercises, performed with mechanical correctness.

"Your left channel distribution is uneven."

He adjusted. Without looking at me.

"Better."

No response.

"Again."

He repeated the exercise. The correction held.

"Wei."

"Hm."

"The breathing pattern. You're leading with your chest instead of your diaphragm."

"Does it matter?"

"It determines where the pressure accumulates."

He shifted. Immediate. Precise.

"Like that?"

"Yes."

On the fourth day, we hit a river.

Not wide — ten meters, maybe — but fast. Snowmelt from the upper ridges, carrying the kind of cold that made decisions about exposed skin. The trail ended at a mud bank and the river said no.

"Can we go around?" Wei asked.

I looked upstream. Downstream. Rock walls narrowing both directions.

"No."

"Can you—" He stopped himself. "Right."

I found a crossing point. Three boulders, roughly spaced, each requiring a jump that was trivial for me and deliberate for a boy with recently healed ribs.

"One at a time. Watch where I step."

I crossed. Turned. He studied the gap, then jumped. Landed clean on the first boulder, wobbled on the second, and I caught his collar on the third before momentum could introduce him to the current.

"I had it," he said.

"You had half of it."

"The important half."

He wrung out his left boot on the far bank. I hadn't gotten wet. He noticed. Said nothing about it.

On the sixth day, rain.

Not the gentle kind. The vertical, committed rain that turned trails to mud and made forward progress into negotiation. We sheltered under a rock overhang — the two of us and the dripping and the grey light and nothing to do but wait.

I built a fire from the wood I'd collected the night before. The overhang kept the smoke from drowning.

"You do that like someone who's done it a thousand times," Wei said.

"More."

"How many more?"

"Enough that I've stopped counting."

He gave me the nod he reserved for answers that told him nothing. Then he pulled out the carving knife.

Wei carved. The bird from before was finished. He'd started something new — I couldn't tell what it was. Neither could he, probably. His hands trembled through the work. The tremor was increasing.

"What is it?" I asked.

He held it up. Turned it. A shape that could have been a turtle or a rock or a lopsided fist.

"Fish."

"That's not a fish."

"It's a fish from a specific angle."

"What angle?"

"Inside the fish."

I looked at it. He was right — if you imagined being inside the fish, looking out, the shape described the interior cavity of something aquatic and hollow.

"That's not how carving works."

"That's what they said about my punching."

The rain continued. He carved. Shavings accumulated on the stone between us.

"Yun."

"Hm."

"How long are we going north?"

"Until north is safe."

"Is anything safe?"

"Safe enough," I said.

He turned the not-fish in his hands. Studied it. Put it back in his pack.

"Okay."

---

The rain stopped in the afternoon. We walked. The trail was mud and the mud was indifferent to our urgency and our urgency was indifferent to the mud and the compromise was slowness.

An hour before dark, I found a campsite. Flat ground between two fallen pines, sheltered from the wind that had followed the rain.

"Firewood," I said. "Dry if you can find it."

He went. I cleared the ground, set stones for a fire ring, checked the perimeter. Old routines.

Wei came back with an armful of branches. Half of them wet.

"I said dry."

"These are the dry ones." He dropped them. Went back. Returned with more. "Those are the wet ones."

"They're all wet."

"The first ones are less wet." He sorted them by the fire ring. Driest to wettest. "You light them and the dry-ish ones help the wet ones."

"That's not how fire works."

"That's what they said about my—"

"Don't."

He grinned. Small. Brief. The first one in days.

I made the fire from the least-wet wood. He watched, then went for water — he'd heard a stream on his way back. Fifty meters east, cutting through moss-covered rock. Cold enough to ache.

He ate what I cooked without complaint, which was generous. Rice, dried roots, the last of the salted meat from three towns ago. The meal had the flavor profile of endurance.

"This is bad," he said.

"It's food."

"Bad food."

"Survival doesn't have a flavor requirement."

He ate the rest anyway. Scraped the pot.

---

That night, he slept facing away from me.

This was new. Before — before the lie — he'd slept facing the fire, or facing me, or in whatever position unconsciousness chose. Now he faced the trees.

I sat with the fire burning down to coals. Listening to his breathing. Feeling the stream — weaker at three meters than it had been at three centimeters, but present. Always present.

He knew I was watching. I knew he knew.

The night went about its business.
