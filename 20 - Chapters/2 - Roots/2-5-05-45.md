We moved in quiet the following days. West, then northwest. Forested hills giving way to river-valley lowlands. I set the pace. Wei followed.

He'd changed.

Small — invisible to anyone who hadn't been watching him for months. His posture was the same. His stride. His voice carried the same inflection and the same Wei-ness that made him recognizable at distances that exceeded visual range.

But the pauses were longer. The gaps between observations widened. He still pointed out rocks that looked like animals and clouds that looked like faces. Still provided the narrative soundtrack that filled the silence I generated. But in the gaps — where his words usually lived — there was something new.

A question. Unasked. Present.

He'd accepted my answer. He'd complied. He'd said "Okay", closed his eyes and slept.

And he didn't believe me.

His trust was total but he wasn't stupid. He trusted me with his body, his training, his direction, his life. He didn't trust me with information that contradicted what his own senses told him. And his senses were telling him that my answer was incomplete.

He didn't push. Pushing wasn't Wei's method.

He waited. I felt the waiting. The feeling was worse than being asked.

On the fifth morning we had breakfast with foraged mushrooms and dried meat. Wei ate with the efficient focus he brought to food — appreciative but functional, the metabolism of a boy who was still growing and whose body consumed everything offered without discrimination.

"These taste like feet," he said.

"Don't eat feet."

"I'm comparing."

"To what?"

"Feet."

"You've eaten feet." I raised an eyebrow.

He shrugged. The shrug of a boy who had spent years eating whatever was available and who considered the question irrelevant to the observation.

"The mushrooms in the last valley were better," he said.

"Those were poisonous."

"Tasted better though."

"Taste isn't a survival metric."

"That's what someone who eats foot-mushrooms would say."

The exchange was normal, enjoyable even. The rhythm was normal. Everything about it was — normal. And the normalcy was the thing that made the other thing visible. The specific, careful normalcy and jests of a boy who was maintaining the surface while processing something underneath.

He looked at me. Not the casual look of conversation — the look that lasted half a second too long, that carried the weight of a question wearing the face of attention.

"Yun?"

"Hm."

Three seconds.

"Nothing."

He went back to his mushrooms. The "nothing" was not nothing. But it was the closest he would come to asking, and the closest I would come to answering, and the closest either of us would come to acknowledging that something between us had shifted.

A sound. Distant. Sharper than thunder. The crack of qi hitting stone, at least a li away. Maybe more. Both of us heard it. Wei's head turned north. The direction we'd come from.

When the sound didn't repeat, we broke camp and started our daily journey to everywhere and nowhere in particular. 

The trail narrowed into a gorge where the river had cut through limestone over centuries that I could count and Wei couldn't imagine. Ferns grew from the walls. Water dripped. The air was cool and carried the mineral smell of stone that had been wet for longer than it had been dry.

Wei walked ahead. His hand trailed along the rock face — fingers reading the surface the way a child reads texture, for information that language doesn't carry. He stopped at a fossil. A shell, pressed into the limestone. Spiral. Ancient. Something that had lived in an ocean that no longer existed.

"This was underwater?" he asked, when I explained.

"Yes."

"The whole mountain?"

"The whole mountain."

He touched the spiral. His finger followed the curve inward, the geometry of something that had grown by turning and turning and turning until it stopped.

"How long ago?"

"Before the sects. Before cultivation. Before people."

He looked at me. The question in his eyes was not about the fossil.

I walked past him. He followed. The gorge opened into a valley where late afternoon light turned the grass amber, the shadows long, the walking easy and the silence between us full of things that neither of us would say today.

We camped near a stream before the sun went down. The grass went over to forest again. We made fire, cooked, ate. The night came. The stars came. The insects came. The quiet came.

I was sitting with my back to him and staring into the fire, my thoughts wandering, when I heard him stand up. Quietly. He walked to the edge of the forest and began to train.

Stabilization exercises. My exercises. He performed them correctly — precisely, with the care of a student who was *testing* rather than *trusting*.

He was testing my answer.

I felt it in his qi-pattern. The methodical quality of a boy told to "train slower" who was training slower and watching whether it produced results.

He trained for an hour. Returned. Lay down and slept.

Before the lie, he would have asked me to show him. Every time. The question that cost nothing to ask and included me in his practice and made his growth our project.

He didn't ask now.

I sat in the dark. Eyes closed. The bolt held.
