The story came to me on the road, seven weeks later. Not the experience — the report.

A merchant. Heavyset, talkative, the kind of man who treated conversation as commerce and silence as bankruptcy. He sold fabric — or claimed to. His cart was suspiciously light for someone who dealt in textiles, and his hands had the calluses of a man who carried things heavier than cloth. I wasn't auditing.

We shared a stretch of road. Two days. Wei walked ahead — still ahead, the new default, the seven-step distance that had become ten and then twelve.

The merchant talked. I listened. I was good at listening — millennia of practice.

"Heard something extraordinary," he said. Day two. Afternoon. "At an inn. South of here. Three weeks back."

I said nothing. Said it carefully.

"Three sects. At the same inn. Three days." He shook his head. "Not together — separately. But for the same person."

"What person?"

"That's the strange part. A woman. Traveling with a boy. Nobody special, the innkeeper said. Quiet. Paid in coin. Left after two nights."

Nobody special. The phrase was mine. I'd crafted it. Planted it in Pig Nose's vocabulary through the simple mechanism of being unremarkable in a remarkable way.

"And three sects came looking for a quiet woman with a boy?"

"Not looking. ASKING. Different thing."

"How so?"

"Looking: you search rooms, follow tracks, check roads. Asking: you sit at the bar, buy a drink, talk. Casual-like. As if you just happened to be passing through. Three times. Three different styles."

He had my attention.

"Tell me about the three styles."

He grinned. The grin of a man who had been given permission to perform.

"First — same day the woman left. Two young ones. Lotus robes — you know the style. Embroidered. Too clean for travel. They came in, ordered tea, asked the innkeeper about recent guests. Polite. Very polite. The innkeeper tells them: a woman and a boy, heading south toward the Black Moor."

South toward the Black Moor. The story I'd left him. Not through instruction — through storytelling. An evening. Rice wine. A tale about a woman seeking an old teacher in the marshlands. Casual. Delivered as autobiography, which people trust because autobiography is supposed to be true and the supposition is the vulnerability.

"Second — three days later. Not a person. A rumor. Another traveler mentions a hermit-master. Three months in a cave somewhere east, writing questions on the walls. Then gone. More questions than answers."

I kept my expression neutral. The hermit-master. The presence I'd felt in the courtyard. Thirty seconds. Two fingers raised. A smile that knew things.

Three months in a cave writing questions. That wasn't a sect's method. That was something personal. Something that operated outside institutional parameters.

"And the third?"

"Not a visitor. A letter. Jade-sealed. On the counter in the morning. Nobody saw who left it."

"What did it say?"

"The innkeeper opened it. Shouldn't have — jade seals mean don't-open. But innkeepers are innkeepers. It said—" He paused. "—'We ask that you leave. You disturb the equilibrium.'"

We ask. The Heaven's Order Sect. Their linguistic fingerprint — commands framed as requests because the request format preserved the fiction of choice. They organized. They imposed symmetry on landscapes and schedules and behavior.

If they were asking, they were afraid. And afraid meant dangerous.

"So?" the merchant said. "Three sects, three days, one inn. For a quiet woman nobody remembers." He laughed. Full, commercial. "Good story, yes?"

"Adequate," I said.

He laughed again. Louder. The insult improved the story.

He didn't know he was talking to the woman. He didn't know that the careful thread of false information — the Black Moor, the southern route — had been woven by the subject herself, placed in the innkeeper's mouth through the ancient technology of narrative. Give someone a good story and they become its vehicle. Not because you force them. Because good stories demand telling.

We were heading northwest. The Black Moor was south. The gap between the story and the reality was the safety margin, and the margin was growing with every telling.

"Interesting times," the merchant said.

"Always are," I said.

Wei looked back. Once. From twelve steps ahead. Checking — not presence but alignment. Was I following. Was I with him.

I nodded. He turned. Walked.

The merchant continued talking. The story continued spreading. The sects continued searching.

South. Toward a moor that existed and a woman who didn't.
