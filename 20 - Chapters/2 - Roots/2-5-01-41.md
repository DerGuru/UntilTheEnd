The signature arrived at dawn.

Wei slept. His core glowed through his blanket — the warm pulse of a core that had stabilized temporarily after a forced march.

The signature cut through the ambient field — not displacing, not warring with the existing currents. Taking up residence. Claiming the space with the authority of something that had been powerful long enough to forget what arrival felt like.

Dao-Seeking stage. High Dao-Seeking — the register just below Immortal.

Not scouts. This was someone who didn't bother hiding. Someone whose presence was a statement: *I am here, and the fact that you know changes nothing.*

Iron Lotus Sect. The signature carried their school's fingerprint — the metallic undertone that their core method produced.

I woke Wei. Hand on his shoulder, pressure. He was up. Eyes open.

"What?"

"We're not taking the pass."

"Why—"

"Now."

He packed. No argument. The trust built from months of learning that when I said *now* the situation had already deteriorated past the point of explanation.

We turned west. Into terrain that punished travel and rewarded hiding.

The rest house sat at the mountain's base. Small, smoke-stained. We entered because Wei's ribs needed rest and other people's presence provided cover.

The crowd was sparse. Two merchants. A wandering monk who had achieved either enlightenment or indifference and didn't know the difference. Two farmers drinking something made from regret.

Wei held a bowl of soup. Thin, over-salted. He ate. I sat beside him and didn't.

The merchants talked.

"—the wanderer with the broken core. He asks in every town."

Wei's spoon paused midair.

"Which woman?"

"No idea. But he pays in core fragments. Must have been someone important once."

Core fragments. Each one a piece of Xu Ran's cultivation — his power, his identity. He was paying for me with himself.

Wei looked at me. The look: *I heard that. I know it connects to you. I'm not asking.*

I ate my soup.

"Finish. We leave in ten minutes."

He finished. We left. The merchants kept talking. The monk kept being serene. The farmers kept regretting.

The qi-signature of the elder pressed against my awareness. Closer now. Half a day, maybe less.

I walked faster. Wei matched me. The mountains rose around us, and the pass we weren't taking faded behind us, and the signature followed.
