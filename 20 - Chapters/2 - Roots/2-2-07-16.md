The knowing came without invitation.

Morning. A plateau stripped of trees by wind and altitude. Wei was asleep — wrapped in his jacket, curled against a rock outcrop that offered minimal shelter from the predawn cold. His breath made small clouds. His qi pulsed in the third-step pattern. His hands, tucked against his chest, were still.

I was packing. Mechanically — the routine of breaking camp that had become ritual through repetition, each action assigned its place in the sequence.

Then I knew.

The Iron Lotus Sect. Three days east. On the pass above the Lin valley — the one with the broken bridge. Four cultivators: two Core Formation, solid and experienced; one Foundation Establishment, young, nervous; and leading them, a Dao-Seeking elder. The presence that meant an organization expected resistance and wanted the resistance to be brief.

I knew their formation. I knew their pace. I knew that the Foundation Establishment one had a knee injury from a training accident and favored his left side.

I knew this the way I knew my own name. Complete. Immediate. Certain.

The taste of iron coated the back of my throat. My hand — the one holding the water container — trembled. Not a qi-tremor. Something else. Something underneath, in a place cultivation didn't reach.

I stood still.

I hadn't seen the Iron Lotus in two hundred years. I had no scouts, no intelligence network, no contacts in any sect that might relay operational information. My qi-perception, even unfettered, couldn't reliably read organizational details at a distance of three days' travel. This wasn't deduction. It wasn't pattern recognition.

I just knew.

I turned the knowledge over. Examined it. Prodded it — carefully, from the periphery, with the awareness that what I was touching might have properties I hadn't anticipated. It felt solid. Real. Distinguishable from imagination by a quality I couldn't name and didn't want to.

"Wei."

He stirred. Three seconds from sleep to functional — the nervous system's adaptation to six weeks of uncertain mornings.

"What?"

"We're taking the west path."

He sat up. Rubbed his eyes. "We were going north."

"West."

"Why?"

The word hung between us. I could have answered with the truth — *I have unexplained knowledge of a sect formation on the east pass and the source of this knowledge is unknown to me and this concerns me more than the sect itself.* 

"Instinct."

He looked at me. The steady, evaluating look that thirteen-year-olds weren't supposed to possess — measuring the gap between what had been said and what hadn't.

He didn't press.

"Okay."

We went west. The terrain shifted — softer hills, more vegetation, rain shadow of higher peaks. Easier walking. Wei's cough improved. His color returned.

The word I'd given Wei was "instinct." It wasn't instinct. Instinct was vague, directional. What I'd felt was precise. The knowledge came with citations, if citations were a thing that knowledge could carry.

I'd felt this before. In fragments. In the things I knew without learning, the reactions I had without deciding, the moments where my body moved before my mind authorized the movement and the result was always correct and the correctness was always unexplained.

Wei stumbled on a root. Caught himself. Kept walking. I adjusted my pace to match his shorter stride.

I pushed it down. Self-deception as survival strategy. The west path. The easier route.

I walked. Wei walked. The sun moved across a sky that didn't care about the difference between instinct and something else. And I didn't think about it — with the aggressive thoroughness of someone who was not-thinking very, very hard.
