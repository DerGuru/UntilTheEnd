We ran for three days.

Walked at speed, technically — but the distinction was vocabulary, not exhaustion. I changed our route immediately. Ninety degrees north. Into terrain I hadn't wanted. Granite ridges. Dead pine. The air thinned and turned metallic. Because the Bear's departure was not an ending but a report, and the report would travel faster than we could.

The Bear now knew three things. I existed. I was here. And I had a weakness named Wei.

The third was structural. Location could be changed, existence denied. But Wei was a constant.

"We're going north," I said.

"How far?"

"Far."

"The ribs—"

"We walk."

His jaw set. The stubbornness-muscle I'd tracked since Lianshan. He looked at me — the look that carried the new layer. The one that had appeared after the lie, sitting on top of trust and underneath compliance.

"My ribs are fine," he said.

They weren't. But this lie was his — a mirror of mine, offered back with the quiet precision of someone who'd learned the game by watching the teacher play it.

Three days. North. Through terrain that punished us — scree, switchbacks, a ravine that added two hours and subtracted patience.

I erased our trail as we went. By hand — qi was too signature-heavy. Obscuring footprints, displacing branches, redirecting evidence of passage into baseline forest noise.

Wei's ribs were healing. The qi-assisted knitting had accelerated the process from weeks to days. His arm was slower — deep tissue bruising resolved on its own timeline, and the timeline was indifferent to urgency.

He marched without complaint. Wei didn't narrate suffering. The suffering was there. It had a schedule. It would leave when ready. A hawk circled overhead — patient, methodical, tracking something smaller than us.

On the evening of the third day, his bandage bled through.

A spot. Dark on grey fabric — a body requesting, through the polite medium of blood, that the march be reconsidered.

"Stop."

"I'm fine."

"Stop."

He stopped. Not obedience — recognition that arguing required energy he didn't have.

I checked the bandage. Rewrapped. Applied a thin layer of healing qi — minimal, careful, the smallest dose that would arrest the bleeding without triggering the stream's compensatory surge.

His chin was set. Eyes forward. Lips white. The color of exertion that has exceeded the body's willingness and that willpower is sustaining on borrowed time.

His look at me: not reproachful. Determined. The determination of someone who has decided that the terms include suffering and who is accepting the terms without accepting the logic.

I finished the bandage. Stood.

"We walk."

"I know."

The forest continued. The silence continued.

"The next ones will be stronger," I said. To nobody. To the truth I owed him.

Wei heard. Nodded. Didn't answer.

The not-answering was new.
