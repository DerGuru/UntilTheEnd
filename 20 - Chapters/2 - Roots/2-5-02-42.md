The detour wasn't enough.

The signature had adjusted for our route change. As if it was tracking us by a different method rather than trail, or it knew the terrain well enough to anticipate our limited options. Maybe both — both was always the likely answer when the pursuer was high Dao-Seeking.

We climbed scree slopes with unstable footing. Wei climbed well. His body had adapted to travel completely in the meantime, with the cellular enthusiasm of an organism that hadn't yet learned limitation.

His body protested. I heard it, not literally, but in the micro-adjustments of his movement, the shortened stride, the way fatigue had settled into his shoulders.

We reached a ridge. Dense forest on the far side, old growth, canopy that blocked sunlight and qi-sensing with equal efficiency. I led us in.

He stood at the center of a clearing. Large. Not tall, but broad. The build of someone whose cultivation had started as muscle and added qi in layers. Centuries of refinement buried under more centuries.

He looked like a bear. His beard was untended. Genuinely neglected, a man with more important things to do than groom.

The air around him vibrated. Physically. The ambient qi responding to his presence the way air responds to heat.

"Honored elder." Bear's voice was soft. The softness of powerful men who have discovered that volume is unnecessary when mass is available. "The Iron Lotus Sect requests your attention."

I stopped. Wei stopped behind me. His qi spiking, the stress response that tightened his channels. His hand found a rock. Instinct: thirteen years of village logic said: if there's a threat, hold something heavy.

"Requests?" I said.

"An invitation. Honored. Open-ended." Bear smiled, technique rather than expression. "Our sect recognizes your cultivation. Your contributions. There is much we could learn from—"

"No."

His smile narrowed. Adjusting from the cooperation script to the resistance script.

"Perhaps the elder hasn't considered—"

"I have."

Silence. The ambient qi tightened — two fields occupying the same space and the space objecting.

Bear looked at Wei. Clinical. Evaluative.

"The boy is yours?"

I said nothing.

"Talented. Young. Unusual qi-pattern. The sect would—"

"No."

Bear's hand rose. Slowly. Deliberately, demonstrating that haste was beneath him.

Qi-pressure. Directed. At Wei.

The air between them solidified energetically, like a hand pressing on a chest, compressing lungs, restricting diaphragm. Wei gasped. His ribs compressed. His breathing went shallow. His qi-field destabilized. He dropped to one knee. He did not collapse, but braced himself.

I felt it.

And then — something else.

A pull. Behind my eyes. Not painful but structural. Something reacted. Not me, something IN me. The same autonomous force that fed Wei's core without permission. It felt the pressure on him and it RESPONDED.

The qi-pressure vanished. Total. Instantly.

Wei breathed. Gasped. He drew air with the desperate efficiency of lungs released from compression.

Bear frowned. I'd done something. He observed the result and couldn't connect cause to effect.

"What—"

Wei was standing again. I hadn't seen him rise.

I looked at him. Tired. The weariness of recognition rather than effort. I hadn't cancelled his pressure. Something had done it for me. Through me. Autonomously.

But the damage was already running.

Wei's qi was still spiking. The stress, the compression, the recovery. His channels knew one response: produce more. Always more.

His hands glowed. Briefly, qi-energy spilling through channels that couldn't contain it. The ground under his feet cracked. Grass scorched in a one-meter radius.

His nose bled.

A thin line. Right nostril. He wiped it — quick, back of his hand. The gesture of someone who wanted the evidence gone before anyone noticed.

But Bear saw it. His frown shifted. The confusion giving way to something worse — the hunter's smile. Something unexpected and valuable.

"Interesting." He was watching Wei now, not me. "Instable. But strong. Where does a boy of this age get—"

He didn't finish. Because Wei's qi was still flaring. And the flare was being fueled by me. By the stream. The autonomous flow responding to his stress by accelerating output — dumping energy into his channels with blind urgency.

I was making it worse. Three meters from him. My presence converting fear into fuel, fuel into instability and instability into the very display that made Bear interested.

The loop. The same loop. The architecture I'd identified and couldn't disassemble because I was load-bearing.

Wei's qi crested. Two seconds — his energy output exceeding anything I'd measured. Foundation Establishment middle phase, outputting at levels twice his advancement. Then it receded. Shoulders dropped. Breathing ragged.

Bear met my eyes. He held them. And for the first time — a flicker. Not curiosity or strategy. Recognition. The beginning of understanding that the woman he was pressuring wasn't an elder to be courted but something older and deeper and more dangerous than anything his sect had briefed him for.

One second. Then gone.

But I'd seen it. And he knew I'd seen it.

"Leave," I said.

Bear didn't leave. His hand rose again.

The clearing waited.
