Wei's father came that evening.

I'd met him perhaps three times in all the months I'd lived on the hill. A man who existed at the edges of scenes — present at meals, visible in the fields, a shape in the doorway when Wei left in the morning and a shape in the doorway when he returned. He didn't speak much. Not reluctance — habit. He'd never been in a room where his words changed anything.

He was thin. Thinner than Wei, which was notable given that Wei had spent six months underfed. His hands were large and raw and calloused, the hands of a man who worked the earth every day and the earth worked him back. His face was unremarkable — a farmer's face in a province of farmers, distinguished from the others only by the configuration of lines that decades of sun and wind and worry had carved into his skin.

He stood in front of me.

Not at the hut. I was outside — sitting on the stone where I sat evenings, the flat rock at the edge of the village where the ground rose slightly and you could see the fields and the forest and the path that led north into the mountains. He'd walked up to me. Deliberately, each step an act of will, the gait of a man who had rehearsed this approach in his head and was now executing it before the courage expired.

He stopped two meters away. Looked at me. His face was — working. The muscles pulling in different directions, fear and determination fighting for control of his expression, neither winning decisively.

"Please go."

Two words. The politeness of a man who understood that he couldn't demand anything from the woman in front of him and had chosen to ask because asking was the only tool he had.

He wasn't angry. There was no confrontation, no accusation. He was afraid. Simply, thoroughly afraid — the fear had moved past emotion and into structure, become load-bearing, become the thing his posture was built on.

"My son," he said. Then stopped. Started again. "He was a normal boy."

Was. Past tense. The grammatical murder of a child who was still alive.

"He caught fish. He collected herbs. He argued with his mother about eating his rice. He was—" Another stop. His jaw worked. "Normal."

I waited.

"Then you came."

It wasn't an accusation. It was a chronology. Before you, things were a certain way. After you, they are a different way. The sequence was the argument.

"He has light in his eyes now," Wei's father said. "People are frightened. His mother doesn't sleep. The elder won't come near this hut." He swallowed. "He's my son. I want him to be safe."

"He is safe."

"Is he?"

The question hung between us. Not rhetorical — genuine. A father asking something he needed answered and probably knew couldn't be.

I looked at him. The lines, the raw hands, the shoulders carrying a family and a field and a son who had become something outside his understanding.

"Yes."

He waited to see if I'd say more. I didn't.

He nodded. Once. Tight.

He turned. Walked back down the slope. His steps were slower going down — the weight heavier, or the courage used up, or the exhaustion of a conversation where everything that mattered was said in the spaces between the words.

I watched him go. A thin man, walking back to a family he couldn't protect from something he couldn't understand.

He was the best of them. Because he'd come. Because he'd asked. Because "please" was a word that cost more than any of the others, and he'd spent it without hesitation.

I sat on my stone and looked at the village and knew that it was over.

Tomorrow I would tell Wei. Tonight I would let his father have one more night of pretending that his son might stay.
