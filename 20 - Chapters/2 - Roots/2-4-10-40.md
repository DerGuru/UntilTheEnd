The inn was small, dirty, and perfect.

Perfect because it sat at a crossroads where three trails met and news traveled through mouths rather than letters. What starts as fact arrives as legend. I needed a legend.

Not for me — for the people looking for me. The scouts, the sects, the growing network whose interest was academic in the short term and lethal in the long term. Distance had failed. Suppression had failed. The only variable I could control was trajectory. Where they looked. The art of being somewhere else by making them certain we were here.

The innkeeper was fat, talkative, and indiscreet — the kind who traded information without understanding its value. He gave and received with equal enthusiasm.

I approached the counter. Wei hung back — I'd suggested he wait outside, and for once he'd complied, either because the suggestion carried a tone that discouraged argument or because the inn smelled like fermented cabbage and even moral conviction has olfactory limits.

"Tea," I said.

The innkeeper poured. Brown, lukewarm, existing in the space between beverage and insult.

"Traveling?"

"Passing through."

"From where?"

"East." A lie. We'd come from the north.

"Heading?"

"South." A lie. We were heading west.

He leaned in. The transaction shifting from commercial to informational. "Heard something interesting the other day. From a merchant — reliable man, been running the river route for years."

I waited. Silence, in conversations with talkers, functions as a vacuum.

"He said there's a woman. Moving through the southern provinces. Unusual. Old — but not *looking* old. You know what I mean?"

I sipped the tea. It was as bad as expected.

"Cultivator?" The question was bait, threaded with casual disinterest.

"Must be. The things he described — " A vague gesture. *Powerful beyond my ability to categorize.* "Said she stopped a tribulation. With one hand."

"Stories grow."

"This one has legs."

I set the cup down. Turned, as though preparing to leave. Then paused — the deliberate hesitation that made the next words feel spontaneous rather than scripted.

"I've heard that story. Different version. They say she went south. Over the Jade Pass. Heading toward the coast."

The innkeeper's eyes widened. The subtle dilation of information acquisition.

"The coast? That's specific."

"Travelers talk."

"They do, they do."

I left. The performance cost me something — manipulation always does, even when justified. Talking about myself, even as misdirection, meant engaging with a mythology I kept locked.

I hated it. Every second. Every word.

Wei was outside. Sitting on a wall. Carving — the rhythmic motion that concealed the tremor.

He looked up. "What'd you tell him?"

"Nothing. Eat."

I tossed him a rice cake from a cart at the crossroads. He ate. Didn't push.

An hour later. The trail west. The crossroads behind us.

I stopped. Crouched. Looked at the ground.

A scar. In the rock. Not surface damage — deep. The mark that qi leaves when expelled violently from a body that can't contain it. The scar ran about a meter, jagged — energy released without direction or control.

I placed my palm on it. Read it.

The signature was familiar. Adjacent to something I'd felt in the tribulation. Not identical. Related. A child's handwriting next to a parent's — recognizable, derived, younger. Less controlled. Damaged.

Xu Ran.

Weeks ago, based on the residual decay. He'd stood here, and his core had spasmed. The crack wasn't healing. It was widening. His cultivation degrading — the slow unraveling of a foundation pushed past its limits.

He was looking for me. And he was running out of time.

I erased the scar. A flick of qi — smoothing the rock, dissolving the residual. Not for his sake. For ours.

Wei hadn't noticed. He was ahead, walking, his back to me.

I followed.

---

Night. Camp. Fire.

Wei carved. The object taking shape — a bird. Small, abstract, something that flew, translated from memory into wood with hands that shook and continued regardless.

I watched his hands. The tremor. The carving.

The stream: flowing. Full. Constant.

"What's that one?" I asked. Not because I couldn't tell. Because silence, held too long, calcifies.

He held it up. Turned it. "Bird."

"Doesn't look like a bird."

"It will." He went back to carving. No defensiveness. The stubbornness of someone who sees the finished thing inside the raw material and simply hasn't reached it yet.

I chose. In that moment. Not the dramatic choice — not the decision to leave, to separate, to put a thousand meters between us. Not that.

The smaller choice. The daily one. The one that was also the larger one, repeated:

*Stay.*

Because the alternative was a calculation I'd run and rejected. A door I'd closed. And the wall I'd built from that decision faced outward, toward the world that might take him, not inward, toward what was actually destroying him.

Which was me.

The fire burned. Wei carved. His hands shook. The bird took shape.

I sat across from him and watched the stream flow and chose, again, tonight, to not stop trying to stop it.

Because trying was the lie that made staying possible. And staying was the truth I couldn't afford to examine.

The bird had wings. Small. Imperfect. Enough.
