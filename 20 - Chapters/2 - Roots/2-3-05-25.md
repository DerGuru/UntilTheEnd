We found him an hour later. Or rather we found someone like him — fever-damp, shaking, half-propped against a tree on the trail's shoulder where the path widened enough for a body to collapse without blocking passage.

A cultivator. Young. Different robes, different build, different signature. Qi Gathering, barely. His qi was irregular — the stuttering pulse of a core that had suffered a disruption and was failing to self-correct. A training accident, probably. A circulation gone wrong, a channel that had spasmed.

He needed help. Sweat-darkened robes, cracked lips, trembling hands.

"Please..." His voice was thin. "Water..."

Wei stopped.

I felt the stop — not just the cessation of movement but the thing behind it. The boy who had organized an evacuation. The boy who had told an entire village where to go and what to carry. That boy was looking at the cultivator on the ground and every impulse in his body was saying help.

But something else was there too. Something I'd put there — not deliberately, not through instruction, but through the accumulated weight of a hundred decisions I'd made in his presence. Every village we'd passed without entering. Every person we'd avoided. Every "too many eyes" and "keep walking" and "not our concern."

Wei looked at the cultivator. Looked at me. Back to the cultivator.

He walked past.

The cultivator reached out a hand. Fingers extended, shaking. His hand hung in the air as Wei's back moved away from it, and then it fell.

"Please... just water..."

We walked. The path turned. The voice persisted longer than the visual contact. Then that too was gone.

We built a fire in the evening, as was our usual. His food sat in front of him, cooling. He didn't eat. His chopsticks held a piece of dried vegetable that he'd been staring at for four minutes.

"You think I should have stopped."

He didn't look up. Wasn't talking to me. Talking at the fire.

"I don't think anything."

"You're always thinking."

"About this — nothing."

He set down his chopsticks. Carefully. The deliberate placement of someone controlling the only thing they can control.

"I walked past a man who was asking for water."

"Yes."

"Because you taught me to."

"Because you chose to."

His jaw tightened. The distinction mattered. It was also the part that hurt — not that someone had trained him to be ruthless, but that the training had taken. That the calculation had run behind his eyes without needing instruction, and the answer had come out the same as mine, and the answer had been: walk.

"I'm not like you."

"No."

"I don't want to be."

"Good."

He stared at the fire. His hands were steady — for once. Not shaking.

The stillness was worse than the tremor. The tremor meant excess — energy that hadn't found a channel yet. The stillness meant his channels had drawn past the point where the body refills on its own.

His food went cold. The fire held.
