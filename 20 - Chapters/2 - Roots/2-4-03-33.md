I didn't sleep that night.

Not unusual — I rarely slept. But this was the first time in centuries that I couldn't. Because the thing in my head was too heavy to put down and too sharp to hold.

*I'm breaking him.*

I sat by the dead fire. Wei slept four meters away. His core glowed — faint, warm, running hot and unaware. My qi flowed to him. I could see it now — couldn't unsee it. The stream was constant. Unchanged by my awareness. Unchanged by my horror. Autonomous.

I watched it for an hour. Cataloging. The flow adapted to his cultivation cycle. When his core pulled, the stream surged. When his channels rested, it eased. The precision was obscene — an ancient energy source calibrating its output to match a thirteen-year-old's intake, and the calibration was happening without my input, without my knowledge, without the conscious deployment that I used for everything else.

My hands were steady. They always were. Even when the thing behind them wasn't.

The most powerful being in this world, and I didn't know what my own body was doing.

Morning. Wei woke and sat up. Rubbed his eyes with the back of his hands, a childish gesture he hadn't outgrown.

"Morning."

"Morning."

"Did you sleep?"

"Yes."

A lie. Small.

He ate. Cold rice. His appetite had recovered since the descent — air thicker, altitude released, food staying down.

I watched him eat and saw the stream. My qi, flowing. His channels, receiving. The exchange that had been happening in plain sight for months. Possibly longer.

"We should move."

"Where?"

"Into the hills. Valley's too exposed."

"More hills?"

"Different hills."

He packed. Efficient, the routine was muscle memory. Bedroll, pack, stand.

"Ready."

We walked. The habitual gap — three meters. Close enough for conversation. I counted his breaths. Fourteen per minute. Each one pulled at the stream. Not much. Enough.

Wei matched my pace. He'd learned that my pace was information. Slow meant safe. Fast meant something else.

Today I walked slow.

"You're quiet," he said.

"Thinking."

"About what?"

"Route."

He accepted that. Filed it. Stored it for later — Wei assembled incomplete answers into pictures I hadn't intended to give him.

We entered the hills. The trees closed around us. The river sound faded.

The stream didn't. It pulsed — soft, regular, timed to his heartbeat. I watched it the way a person watches a crack in a dam. Not to stop it. To know how long is left.
