The foothills became mountains. Not gradually — mountains don't do gradual. They do assertion. One day you're walking uphill; the next, the hill has decided it's a cliff and the cliff has decided it's a wall and the wall has decided that your opinion about its height is architecturally irrelevant.

Wei climbed well. His body was remarkable — not for the metrics, not the qi-throughput or meridian capacity. The remarkable thing was the integration. His muscles moved with qi-efficiency I'd seen in cultivators three times his age. He climbed like gravity was a suggestion he'd chosen to politely consider.

He was also hiding from me.

Not the big things — not the nosebleeds or the tremor or the midnight surges. The small things. The progress.

He'd developed three new compression techniques in four days. I could feel the shifts in his qi-signature during rest stops. Changes that took most cultivators weeks of guided practice, achieved through independent experimentation.

He wasn't showing me. Wasn't bringing them for evaluation. He had learned — from me, by my example — that certain categories of growth were handled privately.

On the fifth day in the mountains, I tested him.

"Channel qi through the second meridian set. Sustained. Thirty seconds."

He did it. Clean. Perfect. The execution was so far beyond the exercise's difficulty that the exercise became transparent.

"That was a test," he said.

"It was an exercise."

"It was a test. You're checking my stability."

"Yes."

He sat down on a rock. Flat-topped, positioned by geological processes that had nothing to do with comfort and produced it anyway.

"How am I?" he asked.

"Better than expected."

"Is 'better than expected' good or bad?"

"It depends on what was expected."

He gave me the look of someone running out of patience with non-answers.

"Your stability is decreasing," I said.

"I know."

He knew. Had calculated it himself, from his own data, through his own observation.

"How long have you known?"

"Since the inn. Since the boy with the broken core showed me what 'worse' looked like."

Xu Ran as benchmark. Xu Ran as end-state demonstration.

"And you're still training," I said.

"The compression helps. When I suppress the signature, the pressure drops. Like releasing a valve."

"Temporarily."

"Everything is temporary."

A sentence from a thirteen-year-old that contained more philosophy than most philosophers managed in a career. Delivered light, practical.

"You're right," I said.

He looked at me. Surprised.

"I'm right?"

"You're right. Everything is temporary. Including the valve."

He understood. I saw it register — the implication that the compression technique was itself temporary and that the temporary would expire.

He nodded. Stood. Picked up his pack.

"More walking?" he said.

"More walking."

"Good. Walking helps too."

It did. Physical exertion diffused the qi-pressure. Not a solution — a delay.

We walked. Up. Into mountains that didn't care about stability counts or compression techniques or thirteen-year-old boys whose cultivation was a lighthouse.

The mountains had their own concerns. We were not among them.
