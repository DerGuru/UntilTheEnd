Xu Ran left before noon.

He packed — if that was the word for three items and the absence of a fourth. A bedroll repaired more often than replaced. A waterskin. A small pouch that clinked with core fragments, the currency of the broken, accepted at a fraction of their value.

Wei watched from the window. I watched from the doorway.

"The road north forks at the river," I said. Information. Not advice.

"I know." Xu Ran adjusted his pack. "I came from the north."

"And you're going back?"

"I'm going forward. The direction is incidental."

He turned at the gate. Looked at me. Then past me, at the window where Wei's face was half-visible behind a shutter that provided the kind of cover that only works if the observer cooperates.

He held my gaze. Three seconds. Four.

"You never told me your name," he said. "Your real one."

"No."

"I'll need it. Eventually."

He walked. Down the path. Past the gate. Through the first stand of trees. His back straight — straighter than a broken core justified. The posture of someone who had lost everything except the angle at which he faced the world, and the angle was not negotiable.

Gone.

I stood in the courtyard. Birds had opinions about territory. The wind was engaged in its ongoing project of moving things from one place to another with no apparent plan and considerable commitment.

And then the world changed.

The air became heavier without moving. The birdsong stopped — the silence choosing the birds rather than the other way around.

I turned.

He was there.

Standing at the edge of the courtyard. Where the stable met the fence. Where a moment ago there had been nothing — and not the ordinary nothing, but the careful, deliberate space that a person creates by choosing not to be noticed.

Old. Old as rivers — the surface moved, the depth didn't. His face was lines and patience. His robe was simple. Gray or brown or the color between that doesn't have a name.

His qi.

The grass between the courtyard stones flattened. Water in the trough by the stable trembled without wind.

I have felt qi for longer than the concept has had a name. I have felt the qi of emperors and ascendants, of beings who shook mountains and beings who chose not to.

This was ocean. Not the surface. The ocean. The entire thing. The weight, the patience, the vast pressure of water that has been water longer than continents have been solid.

Immortal. At least. Probably beyond, into territory where cultivation stages became taxonomy and taxonomy became inadequate.

He raised two fingers. Greeting. The old way — the gesture of equals meeting on a road, acknowledging each other's existence with minimal formality. A greeting that hadn't been used in centuries.

He smiled. Friendly, the way sunlight is friendly. But also knowing.

I knew him. Or I knew his shape. His pattern. A melody heard in a different key, centuries apart. The same melody. The knowing was not memory but geometry.

Thirty seconds. Maybe less.

He lowered his hand. Turned. And was gone. Not walked away. Gone — as a thought ends, not with departure but with completion.

The birds resumed. The wind continued. The courtyard was a courtyard again.

I stood. My hands were still. But the stillness was a decision. The stillness was held.

"That was—" I started. Stopped.

Some names aren't spoken. Not because they're forbidden. Because speaking them would be a reduction, and reduction of something that size would be a kind of violence.

You'd have felt him too. You always noticed the ones that mattered.

I went inside. Wei was at the table, drawing something in the dust with his finger.

"You were standing outside a long time," he said.

"Watching the road."

"See anything?"

"No," I said.

Another lie. Added to the ledger that was growing, that had pages now where it used to have entries.

"Let's go," I said.

We went.
