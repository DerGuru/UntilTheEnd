On the fourteenth day, I stopped pretending we were hiking.

"We run."

Wei looked at me.

"My ribs—"

"Are healed."

They were. Mostly. Enough. The distinction was a luxury our situation had foreclosed.

"We. Run."

He ran.

We moved north at the maximum sustained pace his body could maintain without qi-assistance. I didn't allow qi-output. Qi meant signature, and signature meant detection, and the next participants would be calibrated to the Bear's report.

Through forest that thinned as altitude dropped. Through valleys that smelled like rain. Through geography I knew from centuries ago that had changed in the slow, indifferent way land changes.

Wei's bandage bled through on the second hour. A coin-sized darkness on grey wrapping. His jaw was set — the stubbornness-muscle locked.

He didn't stop.

"Faster."

We ran faster.

Three hours. Ridge, descent, valley, stream crossing, ascent. The geological rhythm of northern travel.

His breathing was controlled — not natural exertion but managed, deliberate respiration through pain. He'd learned this from me.

Five hours.

The blood on his bandage had spread. Palm-sized. The rib had reopened and the healing qi I'd applied had been consumed by exertion.

"Stop."

He stopped. Immediately — the cessation of someone who had been waiting for the command and running on authority rather than capacity for the last hour. His knees buckled. He caught himself. Stood. Breathed.

"You're bleeding."

"I know."

"The rib—"

"I know."

I healed the rib. Again. My hands on his chest. The stream surging at contact. The tremor in my fingers. The cycle that was treatment and damage simultaneously.

He endured the healing. Before, he'd surrendered — his body yielding to my hands with the ease of a boy who believed completely. Now he endured. Compliance total. Trust diminished.

The rib set. The blood stopped. I withdrew.

"The next ones will be stronger," I said.

He nodded. Didn't speak.

The afternoon light came through the canopy in fragments. Somewhere east, smoke — a settlement, or a camp, faint enough that my perception caught it and his didn't. People. Direction. The axis along which the next phase would orient itself.

He shouldered his pack. Winced.

We walked. North. Into whatever north contained.

The bleeding had stopped. The walking hadn't. The lie hadn't. The riss hadn't.

Nothing stops.
