The tree hadn't been there yesterday.

I was certain of this — as certain as I was of anything, which was less certain than it used to be but still certain enough. We'd camped at the clearing's edge, the one where the trail curved around a granite outcrop and the ground flattened into a natural circle of packed earth and sparse grass. The clearing had held our fire, our packs, our sleep. The clearing had not held a tree.

But now there was a tree.

An old jujube — thick trunk, weathered bark, the kind of age you measure in centuries rather than decades. Its roots had penetrated the packed earth with the confidence of something that had been growing there since before the trail existed. Its branches spread wide, casting shadow across half the clearing, and its leaves were the deep green of late summer, each one veined and particular and individual.

I stared at it the way you stare at a sentence that has appeared in a manuscript you thought you'd finished. It didn't belong. It wasn't mine — wasn't anyone's. It was simply there, asserting its existence with the quiet authority of something that had never not existed.

"We should eat," Xu Ran said. He was sitting on one of the tree's roots, his back against the trunk, the morning light filtered through its canopy. His notebook was closed on his knee. He looked comfortable. He looked like a man who had been sitting under this tree every morning of his life.

"That tree."

"What about it?"

"It wasn't here yesterday."

He looked up at it the way you look up at a ceiling — mildly, acknowledging its presence without questioning it. The tree provided shade. The shade was welcome. The shade existed.

"It's obviously been here for years," he said.

*Obviously*.

The word carried the weight of a man who was not lying, not confused, not testing me. For him, the tree had been there. Had always been there. The tree was a feature of the landscape, as natural and unremarkable as the granite outcrop, the packed earth, the sparse grass. His memory contained the tree. His reality contained the tree. His morning had begun with the tree.

Mine hadn't.

The dissonance was vertical — a fault line running through the shared reality of our morning. I saw the tree as new. He saw the tree as old. One of us was wrong. The mathematics of this were simple: I was wrong, or reality was wrong, or the distinction between the two had stopped mattering.

I walked to the trunk. Touched the bark. It was real — rough under my fingers, warm from the morning sun, textured with the hundreds of small irregularities that genuine age produces. I pressed my palm flat against it. The vibration in my teeth shifted. Not stronger. Different. As if the frequency had adjusted to accommodate a new variable.

The tree was not an illusion. The tree was not a memory. The tree was a fact — empirical, physical, verifiable by all the senses that I had learned to distrust but couldn't stop using.

"How long?" I said. "How long has it been here?"

Xu Ran looked at me with the patience of a man who had learned not to answer rhetorical questions from people who were having a crisis. "You planted it," he said.

"I didn't."

"Spring before last. After the rain."

The warmth in his voice was incidental — the warmth of someone sharing a small, fond memory, a domestic detail, a fact about our shared history that had no weight and needed no emphasis. He believed it completely. I could see the memory in his face — my hands in the dirt, the sapling, the rain. The memory was real. The memory was his. The memory was about me doing something I had never done.

I stepped back from the tree.

The morning continued around us with perfect indifference. Birds. Wind. The fox-spirit stretched in a patch of sun, its fur catching light that the tree's shadow didn't reach. Everything was normal. Everything was fine. A tree had appeared overnight and reality had rewritten itself to accommodate its presence, retroactively inserting centuries of growth and a planting memory and the weight of accumulated years into a clearing that had been empty twelve hours ago.

Everything was fine.

The second anomaly was the stone.

We'd been walking for an hour — south along the trail, toward the ridge where the path narrowed and the elevation climbed. The trail was familiar. I'd walked it half a dozen times in the past month. I knew where the stones were.

The stone at the trail's bend had turned. Not fallen, not shifted, not been moved by water or wind or any of the physical forces that move stones. Turned. Like a cup someone had rotated to face a different direction — the same stone, the same position, the same relationship to the path and the earth and the surrounding landscape. But facing east instead of north.

I knew it had faced north because I'd used it as a marker. The flat side had pointed toward the mountain's peak. Now the flat side pointed toward the sunrise. Same stone. Different orientation. No evidence of movement, no disturbed earth, no sign that anything had changed at all.

I knelt. Touched the stone. Cool and solid and factual. The earth around its base was undisturbed — packed and settled and consistent with a stone that had been sitting in exactly this position for exactly as long as stones sit in positions before weather and time and erosion take them elsewhere.

The vibration in my teeth intensified.

The path changed after noon.

Not the trail itself — the trail was where it had always been, the physical route cut by generations of feet through the mountain's terrain. What changed was the path. The route I'd memorized — left at the split pine, straight past the dry creek, right at the boulder — had rearranged. The split pine was where I expected it. The boulder was where I expected it. But between them, the trail curved where it had been straight, climbed where it had been level, passed through a stand of bamboo that I had no memory of ever walking through.

The bamboo was old. Thick. Established. The kind of stand that takes decades to develop.

I looked at Xu Ran. He was walking through the bamboo with the unselfconscious ease of a man walking through bamboo he had walked through many times before. His feet found the path automatically. His body moved through the green shadows with the muscle memory of repetition.

"This bamboo," I said.

"Hmm?"

"Has it always been here?"

He gave me a look. The look said: obviously. The look said: what are you asking me. The look said: are you testing me, and if so, what is the passing grade.

"Obviously," he said.

That word again.

The water was the worst.

A small stream — one of the mountain's countless tributaries, a thin line of water cutting through rock and earth on its way to somewhere larger. I'd crossed it before. It ran downhill, as streams do, following gravity, obeying the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics that governed the behavior of water on inclined surfaces.

It ran uphill now.

Not dramatically. Not the waterfall-in-reverse spectacle that anomalies liked to produce for maximum visual impact. Gently. The water flowed from low ground to high ground with the quiet confidence of water that had always flowed in this direction. No turbulence. No hesitation. No sign that the fundamental direction of the stream had reversed at some point between my last crossing and this one.

I crouched at the bank. Watched the water. The surface caught light — reflected it, bent it, turned the stream into a moving mirror. In the reflection, the sky was blue and the trees were green and the water ran uphill and I was a woman watching herself watching.

The teeth-vibration settled into a continuous hum. The metallic taste coated the inside of my mouth. The morning's images — hands, light, creating — pulsed faintly, a heartbeat in the background of perception.

Something was changing around me. Not dramatically, not violently, not with the theatrical intensity of the field and its rules and its deductions. Quietly. Retrospectively. The changes were small and exact and absolute — rewriting not just the present but the past, inserting themselves into the timeline with such precision that no one but me noticed the insertion.

No one but me remembered the version where the tree didn't exist. Where the stone faced north. Where the path was straight. Where the water ran downhill.

I was the only one who remembered the world before the changes. And I was starting to wonder if that made me right or wrong. If remembering the original version was a gift or a malfunction. If the tree had always been there and my memory of its absence was the error.

If I was the anomaly.

The fox-spirit padded past the stream without looking at the water. Its amber eyes tracked something I couldn't see — something above the treeline, something in the air, something invisible and present and moving through the mountain with the same quiet, retroactive certainty as the tree and the stone and the path and the water.

It tracked something that wasn't there.

Or something that was there now.
