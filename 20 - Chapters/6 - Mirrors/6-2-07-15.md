Evening. The fire. The ritual of flames and food and the domestic ceremony that kept the world from collapsing into meaning.

Xu Ran was whittling.

I hadn't seen him whittle before. He'd started sometime during the afternoon, pulled a piece of wood from the trailside, drawn his knife, and begun shaping it with the careful, rhythmic motions of a man who needed his hands to be doing something so that his mind could do something else. The wood was pale. The shavings curled at his feet. The knife made small sounds: scrape, scrape, the intimate whisper of blade on grain.

His strategy. His method of coping. The way I walked, he carved. The way I pushed away, he shaped. Different responses to the same condition: the accumulation of knowledge that exceeded the container.

I watched him carve and I pulled out the papers.

They'd been in my pack for months. Maybe longer. The timeline was uncertain, the papers' origin smudged by the same retroactive uncertainty that smudged everything else. Notes. My notes. Written in my hand, on scraps and sheets and the backs of maps that Xu Ran had drawn and I had repurposed.

I unfolded the first one.

*It intervened again. The external force — whatever protects me — acted to prevent the fall. I did not ask for this. I did not invoke this. It simply occurred, as if something outside my control decided that I would not be harmed.*

External force.

I read the words. My handwriting. My syntax. My careful, analytical documentation of events that I had experienced and misinterpreted. *External force.* As if the protection came from outside. As if something separate from me — a guardian, a mechanism, a god — had reached in and adjusted reality to keep me safe.

I unfolded the second.

*Something shields me. I do not understand its nature or its motivation. The shielding is consistent; it activates in moments of physical danger and produces outcomes that redirect or eliminate the threat. Three instances this month.*

Something shields me.

The grammar of displacement. The subject removed, the agent obscured, the self written out of its own story. Not *I shield myself*. Not *I redirect the threat*. *Something. It. The external force.* Language designed — not consciously, not deliberately, but structurally — to attribute my own actions to an imaginary other. To maintain the fiction that I was a subject acted upon rather than an agent acting.

Third note.

*The healing was instantaneous. The wound closed between one breath and the next, without cultivation technique, without medicinal application, without any mechanism I can identify. Conclusion: an external factor is responsible for accelerating tissue repair. The factor's origin and nature remain unknown.*

An external factor.

I spread the notes on my lap. Seven of them. Seven careful, analytical, meticulously dishonest records of events that I had caused and attributed to something else. The handwriting was steady. The observations were accurate. The conclusions were wrong, not because my logic was faulty but because my premises were false. The premise: I am passive. The premise: something else is doing this. The premise: I am the beneficiary, not the source.

The premise was the wall's.

The wall had built the premise. Had constructed the interpretive framework that turned *I healed myself* into *something healed me*, turned *I cleared the path* into *the path was cleared*, turned *I shaped reality* into *reality was shaped by an external factor*. The wall hadn't just blocked memories. It had built a language. A grammar of self-deception. A syntax that made it impossible to see myself as the agent because the very structure of my thinking excluded the possibility.

I tore the first note.

Slowly. Not in anger — in precision. The tear followed the creases where the paper had been folded, splitting along the lines of its own structure. Two pieces. Four. Eight. Strips.

The tearing was physical. The kind of action that means something because the body is involved: muscles and tendons and the satisfying sound of paper separating from paper. Each strip was a word, a sentence, a carefully documented lie falling apart in my hands.

I tore the second.

Same speed. Same precision. The strips accumulated in my lap: small, pale, the remains of a narrative that had been true until yesterday and was now not-false but insufficient. The notes hadn't been lies in the intentional sense. I'd believed them. Believed the external force, believed the unknown factor, believed the shielding and the intervention and the mysterious other that kept me safe. The belief had been genuine.

The belief had been the wall's.

Third. Fourth. Fifth.

Xu Ran carved. The knife's whisper accompanied the paper's tearing: two rhythms, two destructions, two people dismantling something in order to find what was underneath. He didn't look at me. Didn't comment. Didn't ask what I was doing or why or whether I was sure. He carved, and I tore, and the evening fire burned between us.

Sixth note.

*The probability of surviving six consecutive lethal encounters without external intervention is statistically impossible. Whatever protects me is consistent, powerful, and specifically tailored to my survival. I hypothesize a guardian entity, possibly linked to my cultivation origin.*

Guardian entity.

I almost laughed. The hypothesis, formal, academic, the careful language of someone applying scholarly methodology to their own existence, was a masterpiece of misdirection. A guardian entity. Linked to my cultivation origin. The investigator investigating herself and concluding that someone else was responsible. The author writing a mystery and never suspecting that the detective and the criminal were the same person.

I tore it. Slowly. Strip by strip.

Seventh. Last.

*I do not know what protects me. I do not know why. I know only that it exists, that it is separate from me, and that its intentions, if intentions they are, have consistently aligned with my preservation. For now, this is enough. Understanding can wait.*

Understanding can wait.

The last strip went into the fire.

The flame took it. The paper curled, blackened, became ash, became nothing. The irreversible nothing of a thing that had been destroyed. The flame flickered, a small hitch in combustion, a micro-hesitation, as if the fire had tasted the paper and found it bitter.

The Luck Debt, maybe. Or maybe just fire being fire.

The strips in my lap went next. One by one. Into the flames. Each one a word, a sentence, a carefully documented attribution of my own power to an imaginary other. Each one burning. Each one gone.

Xu Ran carved. The shape in his hands was emerging, not recognizable yet, not a thing you could name, but a shape. A form resolving from formlessness.

"Done?" he said. Not looking up.

"Done."

The fire burned. The notes were ash. The old narrative was dead — the external force, the guardian entity, the unknown factor, the something that shields. Dead. Burned. Gone.

The new narrative was not yet born. The space between the old story and the new was empty — a clearing, a pause, the held breath between an exhale and an inhale. The old story had been false. The new story was — coming. Not here yet. But the space was ready.

I watched the fire consume the last strip and felt the precise, ceremonial weight of a lie being buried.

Not by someone else.

By me.
