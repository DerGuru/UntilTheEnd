The river was wide here. Shallow, clear-bottomed, the kind of water that showed every stone individually and made you think you could count them. Sun coming down through the tree cover in patches. Mid-morning. The air smelled like wet rock and pine sap and the freshness of water that has been running for a long time without interruption.

I was washing clothes.

Not because the clothes needed washing — they did, but that wasn't the reason. Not because I was performing normalcy — I'd moved past performing somewhere during the dissolution, when the sect dissolved and normal became not a performance but a fact. I was washing clothes because my hands needed something to do while my mind moved through landscapes that words couldn't adequately map.

The fabric — Xu Ran's outer robe, the one with the ink stain on the left sleeve that he claimed was intentional and I knew was a dropped brush — went into the water, and I scrubbed. The motion was ancient. Not ancient in the metaphorical sense — actually ancient, hands-on-stone-river-scrubbing ancient, the kind of physical labor I had performed in lives I couldn't fully remember but whose muscle memory remained in my hands like notation in a margin.

I hadn't done this in centuries. Hadn't needed to. The conviction that clothes were clean made clothes clean, the same way the conviction that the stone was there made the stone be there. I hadn't scrubbed fabric against river stones since — I couldn't even date it. Before Wei? After? In one of the unnamed gaps between named eras, the long parenthetical centuries where nothing significant happened and time was just time?

It didn't matter. My hands remembered.

Scrub. Lift. Wring. Submerge. The rhythm was meditative in the original sense — not calming, not relaxing, but consciousness-altering. The repetition created a channel, and the channel allowed things to move through it that the active mind would have blocked or deflected or categorized before they could finish arriving.

Water through fingers.

I noticed it during the wringing. The fabric in my fists, the water squeezing out, running between knuckles, escaping through the gaps that tightened hands couldn't close. The harder I squeezed, the faster the water ran. Not resisting, the water wasn't fighting my grip. Moving. Flowing. Being what it was. Water's nature was to move, and my fists were irrelevant to that nature, and the squeezing didn't hold the water; it accelerated the water's departure.

I stopped wringing.

Opened my hands.

The fabric lay flat across my palms, wet, heavy, dripping. The water — the water that hadn't been squeezed — sat in the fabric, soaking, present, unhurried. Neither escaping nor running. Sitting. The way water sits when nothing is forcing it anywhere. Gravity would take it eventually. Time would take it. But in the moment between opening my hands and gravity's patient claim, the water was simply there.

Fists: the water escapes.
Open hands: the water stays.

I looked at my hands. The fabric. The river moving around my ankles, cold, the temperature a genuine sensation since the breach. My hands were pruned, the wrinkled fingertips of prolonged immersion, the body's irrelevant preparation for better grip on wet surfaces. My body still did this. Still went through the motions of being a body, adjusting, adapting, responding to stimuli with the automatic competence of a body that didn't know it was running on conviction rather than biology.

The insight didn't arrive as thought.

It arrived as the water. As the physical, sensory, body-located experience of water flowing through fingers and water sitting in open palms. As the difference between gripping and holding. As the non-verbal understanding that a body learns before a mind can articulate.

Something was beginning. Not formed yet, not crystallized. The raw material of understanding, present but unprocessed, the way ore exists in rock before anyone identifies it as metal. I was standing in a river with wet clothes in my hands and something was beginning and I couldn't name it yet and the inability to name it was correct. Some things needed to exist as experience before they could accept the reduction of language.

Xu Ran was upstream. Sitting on a flat rock, notebook open, brush in hand, doing the thing where he pretended to be documenting botanical observations while actually documenting me. His angle, slightly turned, peripheral vision engaged, was the angle of a man who wanted to watch without being seen watching. I'd identified this angle early on. I'd stopped caring about it months ago. Now it was furniture.

The fox-spirit was downstream, drinking. Delicate, precise laps, the tongue working within a framework of efficiency that wasted nothing. It raised its head. Water dripping from amber-lit whiskers. Looked at me. The look of an animal that had seen a human doing something obvious and was waiting for the human to catch up.

I looked back at it.

Then I looked at the water. At my hands. At the fabric.

I submerged the robe again. Not wringing this time. Just holding it. Open-handed. The water moving through the fabric, through my fingers, through the space between all of it. Moving the way water moved. Not because I was allowing it, not because I was letting it, not because my hands were performing the correct spiritual posture. Moving because that was what water did. My hands were incidental. My intention was irrelevant. The water moved because it was water.

Something was crystallizing. Not yet. Almost.

I stood in the river with someone else's robe in my hands and the sun through the trees and the fox downstream and the man upstream and the water through my fingers and I waited for it. Without impatience. Not desperately. I waited the way open hands wait for water — without gripping, without forcing, without the violence of urgency.
