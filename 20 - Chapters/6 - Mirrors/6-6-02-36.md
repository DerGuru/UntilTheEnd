The voice came while I was eating.

Xu Ran's rice: the evening portion, cooked with whatever herbs the trailside offered, seasoned with the care of a man who treated meals as architecture. The rice was warm. The herbs were adequate. The eating was routine.

The voice said: *You already know.*

Quiet. Unintrusive. No fragment-crash of the echoes, no chaotic overlay of the field. Clear. The clarity of something heard in a quiet room, something spoken at conversational volume, something intended to be understood rather than endured.

I stopped chewing.

More pause than full stop. Someone across a table saying something worth hearing. A conversational shift. An attentional adjustment. Chopsticks hovering between bowl and mouth.

*You already know.*

The voice was mine.

Unlike the Thought-Echoes, which had been technically mine: fragments, shards, compressed transmissions from a part of myself that I couldn't access. Unlike the Monologue-Split: the split, the two-voice arrangement, the internal dialogue between a surface self and a deeper self. This was mine the way my breathing was mine, my heartbeat mine. Unquestionable. Unsplit. Integral.

These were my thoughts.

Not a second voice. Not a splinter or a fragment or a compressed transmission from behind the wall. My thoughts, arriving from a depth I hadn't previously recognized as accessible, carrying information I'd always possessed but hadn't been able to surface.

I set the chopsticks down.

The thoughts continued. Quiet. Present. Available. Like a conversation partner who had always been sitting at the table but whom I'd been unable to see because the chair was facing the wrong way. Now the chair was turned. Now we were face to face. Now the speaker and the listener were the same person and the conversation was a monologue and the monologue was whole.

The Monologue-Split, the split that had defined my interior experience for months, was dissolving. Without drama, without the theatrical symmetry of a resolution. It was dissolving the way fog dissolves: gradually, unevenly, the dense parts thinning and the thin parts clearing and the landscape beneath emerging in patches of increasing clarity.

The split had been the illusion.

The voices had been real. The content had been accurate. The split itself, the perception that there were two of me, that the surface self and the deeper self were separate entities, that the Thought-Echoes came from somewhere OTHER: that had been the illusion. The wall's last defense. The final trick. If you can't hide the truth from someone, convince them that the truth is coming from outside, so they can disbelieve it.

The self-protection had made me think my own voice was someone else's.

I sat with the recognition. Let it settle. The voice that had said *Not now* at the field: me. The voice that had said *Enough*: me. The voice that had said *Keep going* — me. No guardian, nothing separate from the self that heard the words and attributed them to an external source. Me, speaking to me, through the only channel the wall left open, three words at a time, compressed, urgent, disguised as foreign.

I'd been talking to myself.

For millennia.

"You stopped eating," Xu Ran said.

I looked at my bowl. Rice. Half finished. The chopsticks resting across the rim. An object that had been sitting in front of me while my attention was elsewhere. It was there, it was unchanged, the world had continued its physical operations while the interior landscape reconfigured.

"Hearing something," I said.

His face — the micro-adjustment, the clinical-to-concerned calibration. "The echos?"

"Not echos. Me."

He processed. The processing was visible: the slight narrowing of eyes, the held breath, the momentary cessation of motion that preceded his most careful responses.

"Different from before?"

"Clear. Not fragments. Not split. Just — thoughts. Mine. From deeper."

The tenderness arrived without announcement. Quieter than the overwhelming, narrative-appropriate tenderness that a moment like this might have demanded. Something smaller. Something almost invisible. The quiet tenderness of recognizing that the voice I'd feared — the voice I'd attributed to an external force, a guardian entity, an unknown mechanism — had been my own voice all along and the voice had been trying to help.

The self-protection had been me.

No monster, no prison, no adversary. A part of me — the oldest part, the part that remembered, the part that knew — trying to protect me from knowledge I wasn't ready for. Hiding the truth out of care, not malice. The way a parent hides sharp objects from a child, not to deny the child's agency but to preserve the child's safety until the agency can handle the sharpness.

I had been protecting myself from myself.

And now the protection was no longer needed — not because the truth was less sharp but because the self was ready for sharpness.

I picked up the chopsticks. Found the rice. Continued eating.

Slower than before. Deliberately slower. Each grain a presence, each bite a choice, each swallow an act of attention that the previous version of eating hadn't contained. I finished the rice. Slowly. Completely.

Xu Ran watched me eat the way he watched everything — with the careful, sustained attention of a man for whom observation was devotion.

He didn't ask for more details.

The monologue was becoming whole. The two voices were becoming one. The split was closing.

I was beginning to hear myself.
