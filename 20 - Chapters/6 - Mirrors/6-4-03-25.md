Xu Ran shook my shoulder.

Gently first. Then harder. The desperation of a man who had spent three hours talking to someone who wasn't home, who had tried everything. Voice, touch, the name spoken in every tone from whisper to shout. He'd arrived at the physical option because the other options had been exhausted.

I blinked.

The present arrived: sharp, violent, the sensory assault of a consciousness returning to a body that had been running on automatic. Everything was too much. The light was too bright. The air was too cold. The grass was too green. Each stimulus arrived at full volume, unfiltered, unmodulated, as if the senses had been recalibrated during the absence and the new calibration was set to maximum.

"How long was I gone?"

"Three hours."

His face. Tired — not the physical tiredness of exertion but the deep tiredness of sustained concern, three hours of watching and writing and not knowing and not being able to help. His eyes were red. His hand, when he removed it from my shoulder, trembled.

I reached for the ground. My hand found the grass. Each blade individual, each blade vivid, each blade impossibly exact in its greenness and its shape and its relationship to the soil that held it. I gripped. Hard. The grass resisted, then yielded, then held. Real. Solid. Present.

I needed the earth under me. Needed the physical, tangible, gravitational confirmation that I was HERE. Past the before, past the place of creation. Here. In a clearing. On a mountain. With a man who carried a notebook and a knife and a patience that exceeded the patience of anyone who had ever lived.

"You were speaking," he said. "Words I didn't recognize. Old. I wrote what I could."

His notebook was in his lap. Open. Pages filled with his tight, rushed handwriting: lines of transcription, of observation, of the methodical recording of a process he'd watched from outside. Three hours of careful documentation. Three hours of doing the only thing he could.

I didn't look at what he'd written. Not yet. The memory was still reverberating: the echoes of the creation, the afterimage of the place before places, the residual sensation of a self that had existed before the world and had believed the world into existence.

The reframing happened fast.

Not gradually — fast. Like a lens clicking into focus, like the moment when a hidden image in a pattern suddenly resolves and you can't unsee it. The entire history of my life, of all my lives, of every age, every experience, every moment recorded and unrecorded, rotated. Shifted. Showed its other face.

A wound healing — mine, the belief that I couldn't be harmed — and at the same time Wei's face, too young, too stubborn — and at the same time the mountain cracking, the shockwave, stone splitting because I — and the paths opening, weather shifting, the world rearranging itself around the shape of my — and Wei falling, the settlement gate, the cultivator's technique, the fall happening because I believed everything I loved — and the voice, *Not now*, *Enough*, *Keep going*, the voice that was mine, had always been mine, speaking from behind the barrier in three-word fragments because the wall only allowed — and the healings, every healing, every survival, not a guardian, not an external force, me, my conviction translating itself into invulnerability the same way it translated stones into new positions and water into new — and the reflection that smiled before I did and the field where the rules broke and the coincidences that weren't coincidences, the paths clearing because I believed in clear paths, the weather because I believed in favorable weather, the people who appeared because I believed in outcomes that — and Wei, always Wei, the deep conviction overriding the surface wish, the pattern not the murder, the belief that everything I loved died operating with the same automatic unconscious authority as the belief that I couldn't burn and both of them mine, MINE — and the second voice not foreign, not external, a part of me that KNEW, that had always known, speaking from behind the wall in the only way the wall allowed — and the anomalies, every impossible thing, every breach of physics pouring through simultaneously, the missing mountain the reversed water the shifted stones the reflection the shockwave the field the rules the — all of it at once, layered, overlapping, each one illuminating the others, each one the same truth wearing a different face.

The reframing was not a thought. It was an experience: physical, visceral, the sensation of everything you've ever known turning inside out and revealing that the inside had always been the outside and the thing you'd been looking at was the thing you'd been looking from.

I hadn't been surprised.

That was the strange part. The reframing — the complete, total, fundamental revision of my understanding of my own existence — produced not shock but confirmation. The confirmation I'd feared. The terrible confirmation that arrives when the thing you suspected turns out to be true and the truth is worse than the suspicion because the suspicion allowed doubt and the truth does not.

I'd known. Some part of me — the part behind the wall, the part that spoke in three-word fragments, the part that smiled in reflections — had always known. The reframing was not new information. It was old information finally acknowledged.

I sat in the grass. The clearing was bright. The fog was gone. The sun was direct and honest and showed everything without mercy.

I knew.
