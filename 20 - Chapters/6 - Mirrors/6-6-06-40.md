It came.

Not as a revelation — I was done with revelations, had been done since the twist, since the river where the reflection looked back with knowing eyes and the water rippled from my feet without wind. Revelations were the currency of earlier days, the dramatic unveilings that restructured understanding in a single theatrical moment. This was not that.

This was a body in a river, learning what the river already knew.

I stood in the water. Xu Ran's robe in my hands, half-washed, the ink stain still visible because ink was stubborn and the river was patient and some things took longer than a single washing. The sun moved. The patterns on the water shifted. The fox-spirit downstream had finished drinking and was sitting on the bank, licking a paw with the methodical attention of an animal attending to its own maintenance.

The insight crystallized. Not in language — language came second, arrived after, the translator that showed up late and tried to claim credit for the original thought. The insight crystallized as sensation. As the physical knowledge of what happened when fists became open hands.

I was not trying to become mortal.

I was trying to stop holding myself immortal.

The distinction — which sounded like wordplay, which could have been the kind of clever inversion that philosophers used to make obvious things sound profound — was not wordplay. It was structural. Fundamental. The difference between building a wall and removing one. Between adding and subtracting. Between the muscular effort of gripping and the release of opening.

For eons — since the beginning, since the moment my conviction had made immortality not a gift or a curse but a fact — I had been holding. Not consciously. Not deliberately. The way a fist holds: without thinking about holding, without being aware that it's holding, the grip so old and so constant that the hand has forgotten it's a fist and thinks this is just the shape hands are.

Will was holding.

The belief that made reality — that made stones appear and mountains disappear and the sect not be there — was an act of will disguised as conviction. Not the surface will of the early experiments, not the conscious I-want-the-stone-to-move of the first tests. Deeper. The structural will, the foundational grip, the conviction that was so deep it had become invisible. I am immortal. Not a thought. Not a declaration. A grip. A fist closed so long it had calcified.

And I had been trying to open the fist by gripping harder.

Every attempt to become mortal — every test, every experiment, every deliberate effort to believe differently — had been an act of will. Will directed against will. Fist fighting fist. The very effort to change the conviction was a conviction, and the conviction was a grip, and the grip was the opposite of what was needed.

Letting go was not willing.

The water in the river did not will itself to flow. It flowed because that was its nature, because gravity existed and the channel existed and the water existed and the flowing was what happened when nothing prevented it. The water didn't decide to be water. Didn't will itself downstream. Didn't grip itself into motion.

It let go.

And by letting go, it moved.

I looked at my hands. Open. The fabric resting across them, the water sitting in the weave, unhurried, present. My hands were not gripping the fabric. They were not holding the water. They were open and the fabric was there and the water was there and my hands were there and nothing was being forced or held or willed.

This was the shape of letting go.

Not an action. An absence. The removal of the grip rather than the application of a different grip. Not becoming mortal — removing the holding of immortality. Not believing something new — releasing the old belief the way an open hand releases water. Not by throwing. Not by pushing. By ceasing to hold.

The problem — and I could feel it, could feel the edges of it the way you feel the edges of something you're about to trip over — was that the grip was me. The fist was not a thing I had. The fist was a thing I was. The conviction of immortality was not a belief I held — it was the structure of my being, the foundational architecture of whatever I was, the load-bearing wall that held up everything else. To open this fist was to disassemble myself.

To let go was to let go of the thing that was doing the letting.

The paradox sat in my chest like a stone. Not heavy — present. The weight of a truth that was both clear and impossible. I understood what needed to happen. I understood that I could not make it happen. I understood that the inability to make it happen was itself the proof that the understanding was correct, because making was will and will was grip and grip was the opposite of letting go.

I stood in the river.

The robe in my hands. The water. The sun. The fox. The man upstream who was pretending not to watch.

I did nothing.

The nothing was deliberate — no. The nothing was not deliberate. The nothing was nothing. I stood there and did not grip and did not release and did not will and did not choose. I stood there the way the water stood in the fabric of the robe — present, unhurried, subject to forces that didn't require my participation.

After a while, I lifted the robe. Wrung it. Not hard — the gentle, efficient wringing of someone who knows the fabric will dry in sun and wind and time, who doesn't need to squeeze out every drop because some things can be left to gravity.

"Done?" Xu Ran called from upstream.

"With the robe," I said.

The implication sat between us. He heard it. He didn't respond. He closed his notebook and stood and stretched the way a man stretches who has been sitting too long on a rock by a river, watching someone learn something that he cannot learn for them.

The fox-spirit stood too. Shook itself. Water from its fur, catching the sun, each drop a small lens that showed the world inverted for the instant before it fell.

We left the river. The robe over my arm, damp, heavy with the weight of water that would evaporate in its own time.

I had not let go.

But I had learned the shape of what letting go would look like, and the shape was not a fist.
