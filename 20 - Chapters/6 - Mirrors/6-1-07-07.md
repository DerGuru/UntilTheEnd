Three days.

Three days of the changes accelerating. Three days of trees appearing and streams rerouting and stone formations emerging from hillsides with the full authority of geological time compressed into a night's sleep. Three days of Xu Ran remembering each change as permanent, as original, as the way things had always been. Three days of the sect on the ridge, watching, feeding, growing stronger with each pulse of reality-edit that I couldn't control and couldn't stop and couldn't understand.

Three days of the calm.

The calm frightened me more than the changes. Xu Ran had been right about that — the anger would have been better, the fear would have been appropriate, the panic would at least have been proportionate. But the calm persisted. The deep, inexplicable settling in the space behind the crack, the hands-in-light quiet that had replaced the Thought-Echoes' noise. I walked through a world that was rewriting itself around me and I felt — still. As if the changes were natural. As if the retroactive editing of reality was something that should have been happening all along and the only thing unusual was that it had taken this long to start.

That thought should have triggered the wall.

It didn't.

On the fourth morning, Xu Ran unrolled a map. One of his maps — hand-drawn, meticulous, annotated in his small, precise script. He'd been making maps since I'd met him, recording the terrain with the compulsive accuracy of a man who needed to know where he was in order to know who he was.

"Wrong," he said, looking at it.

"What?"

"The map. It's wrong. The trail I drew last week — it doesn't match the trail we walked yesterday. The creek is in a different place. The elevation changes are — look."

He held the map toward me. I looked. The lines he'd drawn — careful, accurate, drawn from direct observation by a man who prided himself on direct observation — didn't match the landscape visible from where we sat. The creek had moved. The ridge had shifted. A valley that his map placed to the east was now to the south.

The changes had rewritten his map.

Not literally — the ink was still where he'd placed it. But the reality the ink described had moved, and the map was now a record of a world that didn't exist anymore. A fiction. A historical document from six days ago that described a landscape that had retroactively never been.

He stared at the map. The staring had a quality I recognized — the stillness of a man encountering evidence that his instruments had failed. Not his eyes, not his judgment, not his methodology. His instruments. The map. The objective record. The thing that was supposed to be true regardless of memory, regardless of perception, regardless of the treacherous subjectivity of human experience.

"It's changing faster," I said.

"Yes."

"We can't stay here."

He looked at me. "Where would we go?"

"Forward. South. Toward whatever this is leading to."

"You think it's leading somewhere?"

I didn't think. I felt it. The calm felt it. The images pressed toward it. The metallic taste and the teeth-vibration and the hands in the light and the crack in the wall and the wall's silence and the fox-spirit's tracking and the bird's new song — all of it pointed the same direction. This felt like convergence. This was the slow, inexorable approach of something meeting something else, two things that had been separated and were now being drawn together by a force that didn't ask permission and didn't offer alternatives.

I was approaching myself. The self that the wall had hidden. The self that created.

"We can't prepare for this," I said. "There's nothing to prepare. No strategy. No preparation."

"Then what?"

"We move. We go toward it. Because standing still is just letting them farm the changes while whatever's coming takes its time arriving."

Xu Ran folded the map. Careful, precise, along the original creases. A man who treated useless things with the same care he treated useful ones, because the care was the point, not the usefulness.

"The sect," he said.

"Will follow."

"The anomalies."

"Will continue."

"Your wall."

"Is barely there."

He stored the map. Stood. Looked south, toward the mountains that rose beyond our valley — higher, steeper, older. The direction the fox-spirit had been pulling since yesterday, straining at the invisible boundary of its orbit like a compass needle pointing at something more fundamental than north.

"You know where you're going," he said.

Not a question.

"I know where I'm being pulled."

"Same thing?"

"I don't know yet."

He shouldered his pack. Adjusted. Checked the knife at his belt. The morning routine of a man preparing for a walk that might be the last ordinary walk he would take.

"Alright," he said. "South."

The fox-spirit was already moving. It had turned south before I'd said the word, before Xu Ran had agreed, before the decision had been made in any way that a decision could be observed. It knew. The way animals know weather, the way water knows downhill, the way the creating hands in the images had known exactly what they were making.

We walked. South. The trail rearranged itself ahead of us — not dramatically, not visibly. Subtly. The path opening, the terrain smoothing, the route clarifying itself with each step as if the mountain itself was agreeing to let us through.

Leading us.

Behind us, on the ridge, the sect followed. A hundred and twelve figures moving parallel to our path, maintaining distance, maintaining patience, maintaining the careful, sustainable harvest of power that my existence provided.

Ahead of us, the mountains rose.

In my mouth, the metallic taste intensified. In my teeth, the vibration hummed. In my chest, behind the crack, in the space where the wall was thinning, the images pulsed — hands, light, creating — quiet and constant and absolutely certain.

No more preparation. No more standing still. Forward.

We moved.
