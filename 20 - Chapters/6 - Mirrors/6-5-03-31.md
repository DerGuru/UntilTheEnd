The trees were wrong.

I woke to symmetry. The pines around the camp — six of them, mountain pines, the kind that grow where they please and answer to no landscaper — stood in a perfect circle. Equal spacing. Equal height. Each trunk vertical, each canopy balanced, each root system arranged in the same radial pattern. A circle so precise that a geometer would have wept.

"Those didn't stand like that," Xu Ran said. He was already awake, sitting by the dead fire, staring at the trees with the stillness of a man whose reality had been edited while he slept.

The trees looked like they'd always stood like that. The moss confirmed it. The earth confirmed it. The undergrowth between the trunks had grown in patterns consistent with decades of circular symmetry.

"No," I said. "They didn't."

But they had. Because I'd slept, and in sleeping, the belief-engine had continued its autonomous operation — shaping, adjusting, conforming the world to the architecture of my convictions without asking my permission, without requiring my consciousness, without needing any of the waking processes that I might have used to monitor or modify its behavior.

I shaped the world in my sleep.

The implication was — I sat with it. Let it arrive. Let its weight settle. I shaped the world in my sleep. My unconscious beliefs — the deep, structural, foundational convictions that constituted my being — operated continuously. Not when I was concentrating. Not when I was believing deliberately. Always. Every moment. Every breath. Every second of sleep and waking and the uncountable moments between.

Twenty-four hours. Seven days. Three hundred and sixty-five days. Times a thousand. Times a thousand again. Times more. The multiplication was dizzying — the accumulated total of unconscious reality-edits produced by a consciousness that had never stopped believing for a single moment since the beginning of time.

Every tree I'd ever walked past. Every stone I'd ever noticed. Every path I'd ever traveled. How much of what I saw was what existed, and how much was what I believed existed? How much of the world was the world, and how much was me?

"I can't turn it off," I said. "Not even in sleep."

Xu Ran looked at the perfect circle of pines. His face performed the micro-calculation that preceded his most careful observations. "That means everything you interact with —"

"Gets shaped. Yes."

"Everything you see."

"Yes."

"Everything you believe about."

"Yes."

The circle of trees stood in the morning light, their symmetry beautiful and terrible and entirely unconscious. A woman's idea of what trees should look like, imposed on trees that had their own ideas, overwritten by a belief so total that it operated without waking the believer.

I couldn't turn it off.

The realization was not new — it was a refinement of the cliff-realization, the flame-realization, the logical-loop realization. But the trees made it physical. The trees made it visible. The trees stood there in their impossible perfection and testified, with the mute authority of wood and bark and root, that the woman sleeping among them had reshaped them in the night.

"The sect—" Xu Ran started.

"Is coming."

I could feel them. Since the twist, since the knowledge, since the *I am it*, the feeling had sharpened — the sense of their presence, the awareness of their cultivation signatures, the weight of a hundred-plus cultivators moving through the mountains with the patience of collectors approaching a source.

They were closer than they'd been.

They were always going to come. The anomalies I produced — the unconscious edits, the sleeping rearrangements, the constant, involuntary reshaping of reality — fed them. Had been feeding them. Would continue feeding them as long as I existed and they existed within range of my believing.

There was no hiding. There was no running. The source and the collectors occupied the same world, and the world was mine, and everything in it was shaped by me, and the shaping produced excess, and the excess was their food.

The equation had one solution.

And the solution was the thing I was approaching.
