Xu Ran was sewing his pack.

The strap had torn during the field — during the approach, the distance, the moment when I'd sent him back and he'd gone reluctantly and the reluctance had produced a grip that exceeded the strap's engineering. The leather had split. A clean tear, diagonal, the failure line of material subjected to stress it wasn't made for.

He sat by the fire with a needle and thread and the careful, focused expression of a man performing surgery on luggage. The needle went in and out. The thread pulled. The strap's edges came together under his hands with the gradual, satisfying reconciliation of things being repaired.

No enemy.

The absence was strange. For years, there had always been something — the sect, the anomalies, the wall, the Thought-Echoes, the field, the external pressure that gave shape to the internal process. Now: nothing. The sect was relocated. The anomalies had quieted — fewer since the twist, since the knowledge had shifted my relationship to my own believing. The wall was transparent. The second voice was recognized. The external pressures had been removed and what remained was the internal landscape, unobstructed, unpressured.

Just me. And the question. And the man sewing his pack.

He glanced at me sideways. The glance said: you're sitting there doing nothing. The glance also said: here. He held out the needle and a length of thread.

I took them.

Without thinking — without deciding, without the conscious engagement that deliberate action requires. I took the needle and the thread and my hands found my sleeve and the tear at the elbow that I'd been ignoring for a week and the needle went in and my fingers performed the motions of sewing and I sewed.

I hadn't sewn in — I didn't know how long. Decades. Centuries. The action was not in my recent inventory of behaviors. It belonged to an earlier version — a version that performed domestic tasks, that maintained clothing, that engaged with the physical world through the physical operations of repair and maintenance. A version that had existed before the walking became permanent and the permanence made maintenance meaningless.

The needle went in and out. The thread pulled. The tear's edges met.

I was repairing.

The word arrived with the action — unbidden, unanalyzed, the natural label for the thing my hands were doing. Repairing. Fixing what was torn. Closing what was open. The domestic version of what I'd been trying to do to myself — close the gap, repair the tear, fix the thing that was broken.

Except that sewing a sleeve was simple. You saw the tear. You had thread. You put the thread through the fabric and pulled. The fabric came together. Done.

Why couldn't the self be sewn?

The question was absurd and the absurdity was the answer. Selves aren't fabric. Beliefs aren't tears. The needle that closes cloth doesn't reach the level where convictions live. The metaphor was seductive and wrong.

But the sewing was real. The thread was real. The repaired sleeve was real. And the experience of repairing — the physical engagement with a broken thing, the hands performing the operations of fixing, the quiet satisfaction of edges meeting — was, itself, something.

Productive. Without deciding to be.

Xu Ran sewed. I sewed. The fire cracked. The fox-spirit slept at the fire's edge, curled tight, eyes closed for once. The afternoon was warm and quiet and domestic and the domesticity was not a distraction from the work but the work itself.

"There's a story they tell in the lowlands," Xu Ran said. Not looking up. The voice of a man filling silence the way he filled his notebook — methodically, without urgency. "About a woman who made a hundred warriors vanish. Swallowed their souls, supposedly. Consumed them. They say she opened her mouth and the soldiers disappeared into her."

The needle stopped in my hand.

"Who tells this?" I said.

"Traders. Innkeepers. The version varies. In one, she's ten feet tall. In another, she has silver eyes. In all of them, she consumes."

I pulled the thread through the fabric. The stitch was tight. Too tight.

"I moved them," I said. "Not consumed. Moved. From one place to another. No mouths involved. No swallowing. No souls."

Xu Ran looked at me. The long, still look of a man who had stopped sewing because what he was hearing was not new but was being said for the first time.

"The story I'm thinking of is over five hundred years old," he said. Quietly. 

"It was a border dispute," I said. "Two villages. Sixty men between them, not a hundred. They had farming tools, not swords. I moved them to opposite ends of a valley and by the time they walked back, a day and a half each way, they were too tired to fight."

The fire cracked. Xu Ran held the needle in his hand, forgotten. The leather strap hung between his fingers.

"You're telling me," he said.

"I'm telling you."

He returned to his pack. The needle went in and out. The leather strap's edges continued their reconciliation. His face was the face of a man who had carried a theory for years and was hearing it confirmed not with evidence but with a voice that said *I* and meant it.

The fire cracked. The fox-spirit slept. I sewed my sleeve and listened to the afternoon and wondered how many versions of me were being told around how many fires and how many of them involved consuming and mouths and ten-foot women with silver eyes, and how many contained the single, unspectacular truth: that I had moved them, that was all, that the moving had been enough.
