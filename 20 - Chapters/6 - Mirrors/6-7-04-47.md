The crossroads was literal.

A point on the mountain path where the trail split — clearly, physically, without ambiguity. Left: downward, into the valley, toward the distant suggestion of rooftops and smoke that indicated a town. Right: upward, into the higher ranges, where the vegetation thinned and the rock became exposed and the sky was closer than the ground.

Left was civilization. Warmth. Food that someone else cooked. Walls. The accumulated comforts of a species that had spent its history building shelter against the hostilities of the outside world.

Right was mountains. Stone. Cold. The increasing absence of everything that made life comfortable and the increasing presence of everything that made life raw.

Xu Ran didn't hesitate.

He stood at the junction — pack on his shoulder, walking staff in his left hand, the scholar-traveler in his customary posture of readiness — and he looked at both paths. The looking was not consideration. It was the look of a man confirming what he already knew, the way you look at a door before walking through it, not to decide whether to enter but to verify that the door is there.

He went right.

No question. No glance at me. No dramatic pause to indicate the weight of the decision. He shifted his pack, adjusted his staff, and took the upward path with the same stride he'd been walking all morning — measured, steady, the three-quarter pace that had become full pace since we started walking beside each other.

He went right because of course he went right.

I watched him walk five steps up the ascending trail before I followed. Not because I was deciding — I'd decided before the crossroads existed, had decided before the twist, had decided somewhere in the accumulated certainty of all this walking toward a thing she couldn't name but could now name and the name was: the cave. The pause was — observation. The calibrated observation of watching a mortal man choose the hard path without hesitation and recognizing what the choice contained.

His last stretch as a seeker.

Xu Ran had spent his life looking. Libraries, ruins, archives, the systematic investigation of the extraordinary by extraordinary means of ordinariness — pen, paper, observation, patience. He had been seeking since before I met him, since childhood presumably, since whatever formative experience had installed in a young scholar the conviction that the world contained mysteries worth pursuing and that the pursuit was a valid way to spend a life.

Now the mystery walked beside him.

He wasn't seeking anymore. The answer — whatever the answer was, however incomplete, however conditional — was here, present, walking on two feet, eating his rice, washing his clothes in rivers. The answer was a woman who had created immortality through conviction and was now trying to uncreate it through release, and the answer was messy and unfinished and the answer burned the rice.

He went right because the right path led to the end of the seeking, and the end of the seeking was not the absence of purpose but the transformation of purpose. He was no longer looking FOR something. He was looking AT something. Witnessing. Accompanying. The scholar's final, most difficult work: being present for a story whose ending he could not predict and recording it not because it would be read but because the recording was the relationship.

I caught up. Walked beside him. The right-hand path climbed.

"No provisions up there," he said.

"I know."

"I have rice for three days. Maybe four."

"I know."

"After that, we forage. Or starve. I'll forage. You'll be fine."

"I know."

The staccato exchange — fact, acknowledgment, fact, acknowledgment — was the rhythm of two people who had moved past the need for persuasion, past the need for discussion, past the elaborate negotiation of priorities that characterized relationships in earlier phases. We were not debating whether to go right. We were going right and discussing logistics, which was a fundamentally different kind of conversation.

The fox-spirit had already gone right. Had been going right for several minutes, trotting up the ascending path without waiting for human decision-making, its amber tail the only moving thing on the rocky trail. It had known. Or it hadn't known and had simply gone right because right was upward and upward was where it wanted to be. The motivation of foxes was not my area.

The path narrowed as it climbed. The trees — already sparse — became sparser. Pine gave way to scrub, scrub gave way to rock with tenacious vegetation clinging to cracks, the botanical stubbornness of plants that grew where no reasonable plant would choose to grow.

Behind us — below us, now — the valley spread. The town. The smoke. The lives of people who had homes and occupations and the anchored, rooted existence of humans who stayed in one place and let the seasons turn around them.

I didn't look back.

Not out of drama. Not out of the symbolic refusal-to-look-back that narrative tradition assigned to moments of departure. I didn't look back because looking back wasn't the direction I was going, and the direction I was going was the only direction that mattered.

Xu Ran walked beside me. The path climbed. The fox-spirit waited at the next turn, sitting on a rock, tail wrapped around its paws, the patient tolerant expression of an animal that had arrived five minutes ago and found the wait instructive.

We climbed.
