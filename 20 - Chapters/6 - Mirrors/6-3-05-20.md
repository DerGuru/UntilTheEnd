Days.

The days had a quality. Present but uninhabited. I occupied them the way furniture occupies a room: spatially, without contributing to the room's meaning. I walked. Ate when Xu Ran put food in front of me. Slept when darkness suggested sleeping. The operations of a body that had been maintaining itself for millennia and saw no reason to stop now.

The guilt was not an emotion.

This was the thing I couldn't explain — not to Xu Ran, not to the silence that followed me through the mountains like a second shadow. Guilt, in the stories, in the language that humans used to describe the experience of having done wrong. Guilt was a feeling. Hot. Urgent. A fire in the chest, a presence that announced itself and demanded engagement.

This wasn't that.

This was absence. A space where something had been and wasn't. Like a tooth pulled. The tongue finds the hole, the mouth reorganizes around the missing thing. The guilt was a hole in the center of my experience, and everything else, perception and thought, the relentless data of being alive, flowed around the hole and left it untouched. I was a vessel with a puncture. Everything drained toward the center and vanished into the space where the question lived.

*Have I killed Wei?*

The question didn't repeat. It didn't need to. It had been asked and the asking was permanent. The permanence was the punishment. The question existed in the same way that the evidence of my power existed. Retroactively, immune to revision. It had always been asked. It would always be asked. The asking was a feature of my landscape now, like the metallic taste or the teeth-vibration. Except that the vibration was silent and the only thing remaining was the question and the hole.

Xu Ran cooked.

He cooked with the determined, regular precision of a man who had decided that the world's most essential response to catastrophe was rice. He made it three times a day. He seasoned it with whatever he found on the trailside. Not those herbs. Different ones. He adapted. He maintained the domestic protocol with the quiet heroism of someone who understood that normalcy was not insufficient but necessary.

He talked about weather.

"Rain tonight," he'd say. Or: "The wind's shifted east." The meteorological observations of a man who had nothing to say about the thing that mattered and had decided that the things that didn't matter were worth saying anyway. Because saying things that didn't matter was a way of filling the silence with sound that didn't wound. A way of proving that the world still contained ordinary facts alongside extraordinary ones.

He counted provisions.

"Three days of rice. Five of dried meat. We'll need water tomorrow."

The logistics of survival. The practical, material requirements of two bodies continuing to exist in a world that required food and shelter, all the mundane inputs that consciousness couldn't override. Or could it? Could I believe us fed? Could I believe the rice replenished, the provisions permanent?

Could I believe Wei alive?

The thought arrived and the hole received it, unchanged. The walking continued.

The anomalies stopped.

This was the detail that frightened me more than the guilt itself. Since the question — since the asking, since the night on my knees with Xu Ran's hand on my back — the anomalies had stopped. No trees appearing. No retroactive insertions of things that had always been there into positions they'd never occupied.

The belief-engine had frozen.

The machinery that had been producing changes — unconsciously, the constant low-level editing of reality that I now understood was mine — had stopped. Locked. The grief and the guilt had overwhelmed the process, had flooded the mechanism with a conviction so large and so terrible that no other conviction could operate alongside it.

I believed I might have killed Wei. That belief was so total, so consuming, that it left no room for smaller beliefs. No room for stones moving. No room for any of the casual, unconscious adjustments that my existence normally produced.

The sect on the ridge waited.

They were still there, distant and patient, the hundred and twelve figures maintaining their parallel path. But the feeding had stopped. The anomaly-pulses that had been nourishing their cultivation had dried up. The source was frozen. The farm was fallow.

I noticed them the way I noticed everything. Present but uninhabited. Data received but not processed. They were on the ridge, waiting. They would continue to wait. The information was accurate and irrelevant.

I combed my hair.

The gesture was — I didn't know where it came from. I sat by the dead fire and pulled my fingers through the strands and counted. One hundred. Two hundred. Three hundred. The counting was the point — not the number, not the mathematical product of the exercise. The counting. The mechanical, repetitive action of assigning numbers to things. A practice of control in a space where control had become meaningless.

Xu Ran watched me count. He didn't intervene. Didn't offer comb or comment. He recognized it — the processing, the body's attempt to handle what the mind couldn't. The fingers in the hair. The small, repetitive proof that some things could still be counted, still be made to participate in the sequential logic that grief had disrupted.

Four hundred.

I stopped. Not because four hundred was significant. Because the stopping was as arbitrary as the counting and the arbitrariness was the point.

I put my hands in my lap. The hands that shaped reality. The hands that might have shaped Wei's death.

The hole received the thought. The hole was unchanged.

Xu Ran started a fire. The physical way — flint and patience. The mortal method. The method that didn't require belief or the kind of certainty that I was no longer capable of producing.

The fire caught.

We sat.

The silence between us was not empty. It was full — full of the question and the guilt, all the things that mattered and didn't matter, living side by side in the space between two people who had nothing to say and everything to carry.
