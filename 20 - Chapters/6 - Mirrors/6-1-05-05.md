They stood on the ridge like a painting.

A hundred and twelve — I counted, because counting was something I could do, something concrete, something that didn't require me to confront the implications of counting. A hundred and twelve cultivators arranged along the ridge's spine in a formation that was neither military nor ceremonial but something between the two. Patient. Organized. Still.

They'd reformed.

The sect that should have scattered after the field — after the near-death, after the complete unraveling of whatever operational structure they'd maintained — had not scattered. Had reformed. Had come back stronger, tighter, more integrated, as if the catastrophe hadn't broken them but compressed them, the way pressure doesn't destroy carbon but rearranges it into diamond.

Pencil stood at the center.

I called him Pencil because that was how I'd first seen him — thin, angular, precisely drawn, with the kind of bone structure that looked like it had been designed for efficiency rather than aesthetics. He hadn't earned a real name because real names required direct speech and direct speech required proximity and proximity to Pencil was something I had been systematically avoiding.

He was different.

The last time I'd seen him — through the haze of the collapse, through the field's dissolution, through the smoke and the noise and the general chaos of reality reasserting itself after a prolonged argument with its own rules — he'd been diminished. Pale. Shaken. The look of a man who had pushed too close to something he couldn't control and had been reminded, violently, of his limitations.

Now he looked fed.

There was no other word for it. He looked nourished — filled, strengthened, saturated with something that humans didn't normally have access to. His cultivation signature was different. Thicker. More resonant. As if the anomalies — my anomalies, the retroactive changes, the reality-edits that had been accumulating around me like sediment — had fed him. Had fed all of them.

The anomaly-boost.

The phrase arrived with the understanding. They'd absorbed the excess. The changes I'd been producing — the tree, the stone, the water, the flowers, the bamboo — each one had released something. Energy. Potential. The residual force of reality being overwritten. And they'd caught it. Collected it. Refined it. Used it the way cultivators use everything — as fuel. As resource. As the raw material of power.

A hundred and twelve cultivators, boosted by my own unconscious edits, arranged on a ridge overlooking the valley where Xu Ran and I had been walking for three days.

Watching.

Not attacking. Not approaching. Not performing any of the aggressive, confrontational behaviors that the sect had defaulted to in previous encounters. Watching. The way you watch a storm approach — with respect, with caution, with the certain knowledge that the storm will arrive whether you watch it or not but that watching is still the appropriate response.

They were patient.

The patience was the terrifying part. In every previous encounter, the sect had been aggressive — driven by urgency, by ambition, by the cultivator's fundamental inability to let power exist without trying to claim it. They'd attacked. Manipulated. Schemed. The standard vocabulary of sect behavior.

Now they waited.

"How many?" Xu Ran said. He was standing beside me, looking at the ridge. His voice was level — the controlled calm of a man who had learned to be calm in situations that didn't deserve calm. His hand was near his belt, where the small knife he carried hung.

"A hundred and twelve."

"More than before."

"Yes."

"They look —"

"Different. I know."

Pencil was looking at me. Not at us — at me. The directed attention of someone who saw exactly one thing worth watching. His face was still. His cultivation energy was reined in, controlled, the disciplined restraint of someone who had learned that power displayed was power wasted.

He was waiting for me.

They were all waiting for me. The entire formation, the hundred and twelve bodies arranged along the ridge with their anomaly-boosted cultivation and their reformed structure and their devastating, unprecedented patience — they were waiting for me to do something. To change something. To produce another retroactive edit that would release another pulse of residual energy that would feed them, strengthen them, compress them further into whatever they were becoming.

They were farming me.

The realization was cold. Clean. Mathematical. They didn't need to attack. They didn't need to confront. They didn't need to do anything at all except wait for me to exist, to live, to walk through the mountains and unconsciously edit reality around me, and then they would absorb the excess and grow stronger and wait some more.

A sustainable model. A closed circle. Me as the source. Them as the collectors. The anomalies as the medium.

I stood on the trail and looked at Pencil and Pencil looked at me and between us was the valley and the air and the understanding that we were no longer adversaries in any meaningful sense. We were participants in an equation. Variables in a function that neither of us had written and both of us were learning to read.

"We're out of time," I said.

Xu Ran looked at me.

"The changes are accelerating. The anomalies are getting bigger. They're getting stronger from the anomalies. And I can't stop producing them because I don't know how I'm producing them."

"Can you —"

"No."

The refusal came before the question finished. I didn't know what he'd been about to ask — Can you stop them? Can you leave? Can you fight them? — but the answer was the same for all of them. No. I couldn't stop producing anomalies I didn't know I was producing. I couldn't leave because leaving would just move the anomalies somewhere else where someone else would absorb them. I couldn't fight a hundred and twelve cultivators who had been specifically, passively strengthened by my own unconscious power.

The fox-spirit stood at the trail's edge, its body tense, its amber eyes fixed on the ridge. Every hair on its back was raised. Its tail was low and still, the posture of a predator that has recognized a threat it cannot engage.

It had been tracking them. All day. The invisible things it had been watching — the things above the treeline, the things in the air — hadn't been anomalies.

They'd been scouts.

Pencil raised one hand. A small gesture — economical, precise, the cultivator's equivalent of a nod. Acknowledgment. Recognition. The gesture of a man who had seen what he came to see and was satisfied with what he'd seen and would be back tomorrow to see it again.

The formation dissolved. Not dramatically — no theatrical departure, no display of power, no parting reminder of their strength. They simply turned and walked, a hundred and twelve figures moving along the ridge's spine and then over it and then gone, absorbed into the mountain's terrain with the ease of something that belonged there.

Gone.

The ridge was empty. The valley was quiet. The evening light performed its ordinary transformation of the ordinary world, and I stood on an ordinary trail with an ordinary man and an ordinary fox-spirit and the knowledge that nothing about any of this was ordinary and the time I'd been using to not-think about what was happening had just run out.

"We need a plan," Xu Ran said.

He was right.

I had no idea what the plan could be.
