I opened my eyes.

The water was cold against my hips. The river had resumed its current, moving again, flowing south, the ordinary behavior of water freed from the suspension my belief had imposed. My clothes were soaked. The fabric clung to my skin with the heavy, intimate weight of wet cotton, and the coldness of the water had become the coldness of the cloth against my body.

Every nerve registered it. All of it. The way I'd been feeling things since the breach, acutely, intensely, with the heightened sensitivity of a body whose numbing mechanisms had been disabled. The cold. The weight of the water. The texture of the river stones beneath my knees. The air moving across the wet skin of my arms.

The fog had cleared completely.

Sunlight fell on the river, on the bank, on the trees, on Xu Ran. Unfiltered, undiffused, the honest light of afternoon in a mountain valley. No theatrical quality. No symbolic relevance. Just light — the kind that shows things as they are.

Things as they are.

The phrase was different now. Before. Before the river, before the ripples, before the *I am it* — *things as they are* had meant the world as given. The world as received. The world as a set of conditions imposed on consciousness by something external, something independent, something that existed whether or not I was present to perceive it.

Now *things as they are* meant the world as made. As believed. As sustained by the continuous, unconscious, unwavering conviction of a self that had created it and maintained it and would maintain it until the conviction ceased.

The same tree on the bank. The same pine, the same trunk, the same roots gripping the same earth. But I knew now that it stood there because I believed in its standing. That its rootedness was my rootedness. That its reality was my reality, generated, maintained, sustained.

The same sky: blue, cloud-streaked, the ordinary sky of an ordinary afternoon. But I knew now that the sky was blue because I believed in blue. That the clouds moved because I believed in movement. That the afternoon existed because I believed in time.

This should have been terrifying. The solipsistic horror of a consciousness discovering that everything is itself — that the other, the external, the independent reality that provides the ground on which identity stands, is a projection. An invention. A belief.

It wasn't terrifying.

It was exhausting.

The exhaustion was physical: the body's response to a revelation that the body hadn't been designed to absorb. My muscles ached. My head ached — not the wall's headache, not the guardian's spike, but the ordinary headache of a mind that had processed too much and needed the biological luxury of not-processing. My eyes were dry.

Xu Ran was at the bank. Notebook closed now. Pen in his breast pocket. Sitting cross-legged on dry ground, watching me with the expression I'd spent months learning to read and still couldn't fully translate. The expression that combined observation with concern with something else, something that wasn't love, wasn't quite love, wasn't any of the words that love usually wore, but occupied the same space and performed the same function.

"Yun," he said. Quietly.

I stood. The standing was effortful, knees protesting, muscles stiff, the body's complaint against prolonged immersion in cold water. I waded toward the bank. Each step sent ripples outward, small, normal, the ordinary disturbance of a body moving through water.

Or was it ordinary? Was any ripple I produced ordinary anymore? Did I produce ripples because my body displaced water, or because I believed in displacement? Was there a difference? Had there ever been?

I reached the bank. Xu Ran extended a hand. I took it — mortal hand, warm, the calluses of a man who used his hands for practical things. He pulled. I stepped onto dry ground.

He handed me a shirt. Dry. Clean. From his pack, not mine. The cotton of his spare, the one he kept folded at the bottom for emergencies. He handed it without comment. Without ceremony. Without acknowledging the cosmic significance of handing a dry shirt to a woman who had just discovered she'd created the universe.

I took it. Pulled off the wet one. Put on the dry one. Cotton on wet skin. The sensation, the friction, the temperature adjustment.

No scream. No tears. No dramatic moment.

Just knowing.

The knowing was enough. The knowing was everything. The knowing changed everything and nothing because the world was exactly the same world it had been an hour ago — the trees, the river, the stones, the sky. The only thing that had changed was the woman looking at it and the woman's understanding of why it existed.

"Shall I make rice?" Xu Ran said.

The question was perfect. The content was incidental: rice, the staple, the unremarkable. What made it perfect was its timing, its tone, its absolute refusal to treat this moment as anything other than what it also was: an evening on a mountain, two people, a need for food.

I nodded.

He stood. Went to his pack. Retrieved the pot, the rice, the water skin. Began the ritual, the mortal ritual, the human ceremony. Pot over fire. Water measured. Rice poured. The simple chemistry of sustenance.

I sat by the fire. Beside him. Close — closer than I usually sat, close enough that my shoulder nearly touched his, close enough that the warmth of his living body reached mine through the dry cotton of his shirt.

And I waited for rice.

Like every other evening. Like every other meal. Like the thousand meals before this one and the however-many meals that would come after.

The truth sat between us. Not spoken. Not explained. Not analyzed or discussed or resolved. Just present. Like a third person at the fire. A guest who had arrived and would not leave. Their presence changed the shape of the conversation without dominating it.

*I am it. I was always it.*

The sentence hummed. Not in my teeth — in my chest. In the space where the crack had been, where the wall had been, where the guardian had patrolled and prevented and managed. The space was open now. The wall was — not gone, not destroyed, but transparent. I could see through it. See what it had been hiding. See myself on the other side.

The humming was recognition. The self recognizing the self. The mirror seeing the mirror. The woman who created the world sitting by a fire in the world she created, waiting for rice that existed because she believed in rice.

The rice cooked.

We ate.
