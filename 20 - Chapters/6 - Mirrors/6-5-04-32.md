They found us on an open field.

Not a dramatic field. Not a battlefield, not a valley floor, not any of the locations that confrontations typically select for their theatrical requirements. An open field. Grass. A few wildflowers. The kind of space that exists in mountains because mountains occasionally produce flatness and the flatness is unremarkable.

A hundred and fourteen cultivators. I counted because counting gave me something to do with the part of my mind that wasn't preparing for what I was about to do. A hundred and fourteen. More than the ridge. They'd recruited, or merged, or produced new members through whatever mechanism sects used to grow.

Pencil stood at the center. Lian Zhuo — the name arrived, unbidden, from somewhere I hadn't stored it. His real name. The name I'd avoided knowing because knowing names meant knowing people and knowing people meant caring and caring meant the pattern.

He looked at me.

Not hostile. Not aggressive. Not even ambitious, in the obvious, acquisitive way that cultivators typically approached power they wanted to claim. Curious. The curiosity of a man who had been studying something from a distance and was now close enough to see its details.

"We want to understand," he said.

The words were clear. Audible across the field's distance, carried by the resonance of a cultivator's controlled voice. Simple words. Honest words, possibly. The words of someone who had been harvesting my unconscious edits and wanted to know the nature of the source.

I stood between them.

Alone. Xu Ran was fifty meters behind. I'd sent him back, my hand on his chest, the physical push that said *not this time, not here, not you*. His face had shown the argument he didn't make, the objection he didn't voice, the protest he swallowed because he trusted the hand on his chest more than he trusted his own assessment.

My decision. My agency. The choice that wasn't coerced and wasn't required and was therefore mine.

A hundred and fourteen faces. Each one a person. Each one a consciousness with a history and a name and a set of beliefs that didn't shape reality because the universe wasn't interested in their convictions. Mortal faces. Cultivator faces. The faces of people who had spent their lives pursuing something that I'd been born with — born AS — and the irony of that was sharp enough to taste.

Lian Zhuo waited.

He was patient. They were all patient. That had been the terrifying thing about them from the beginning, the patience, the willingness to wait, the strategy of collection rather than confrontation. They'd been farming me. Harvesting the excess. Growing stronger on the residual energy of my unconscious edits.

They would continue. They would always continue. As long as I existed in range, as long as my belief-engine produced edits, as long as the machinery operated, they would collect. And the collecting would make them stronger. And the strength would attract others. And the cycle would continue, expanding, accumulating, building toward something that I didn't want to imagine.

The equation was simple.

I breathed.

One breath. In and out. The air tasted like metal, the familiar, constant taste that had become the baseline flavor of my existence. The breathing was deliberate. Preparation. Not physical preparation. Ontological. The preparation of a self about to exercise a power it had exercised unconsciously for millennia and was now exercising with full, painful, devastating awareness.

*They are not here.*

The belief arrived. Complete. Total. The same mechanism as the village: conviction, not will. Statement, not desire. The absolute, irrefutable certainty that a hundred and fourteen people were not standing in this field, because the field was empty, because the field had always been empty, because the emptiness was a fact and the fact preceded their presence.

They were gone.

In a blink. The absolute gone of something that had existed and now didn't. A hundred and fourteen people — their bodies, their cultivation, their patience, their strategy, their years of accumulated power — removed. Not destroyed. Shifted. Believed elsewhere.

The field was empty.

Grass. Wind. Wildflowers. The morning light falling on an open field that contained nothing except a woman and the absence of everything she'd just removed.

Xu Ran turned. Behind him — three hundred meters back, at the forest's edge — figures. Stumbling. Disoriented. Lian Zhuo among them, distinguished by his height and his posture and the way he held his body when the body had been relocated without the mind's consent. They stood among the trees like people waking from anesthesia. Present, confused, alive.

Alive.

Because I'd believed them elsewhere, not dead. Because the belief had carried the implicit conviction that elsewhere meant alive, that shifting meant surviving, that removal was not destruction. Because the deep structure of my believing — the architecture, the pattern, the foundational design — defaulted to preservation. Because I was not a killer.

Or because I believed I was not a killer. And the belief was the reality.

I stood on the empty field. Grass beneath my feet. Wind in my hair. The metallic taste overwhelming.

The sect was gone. Not defeated — removed. Not confronted, but avoided. The confrontation had been a blink and the blink had been total and the totality was the problem.

I'd done it again. Used the power. Reshaped reality. Eliminated a threat by believing it elsewhere. And the elimination was complete, and the threat was neutralized, and the hundred-plus cultivators who had been farming my unconscious edits were now stumbling in a forest three hundred meters away.

And nothing inside me had changed.

Still immortal. Still unable to burn. Still shaping the world unconsciously, even in sleep. Still running the machinery that I now knew was mine and still couldn't stop.

Power outward. Failure inward.

The equation balanced.

Xu Ran walked toward me across the empty field. His steps were careful, the steps of a man crossing ground that had recently held a hundred people and now held none. He reached me. Stood beside me. Looked at the grass, the wind, the nothing.

"They're alive," he said. Statement, not question. He'd seen them at the tree line.

"Yes."

"Three hundred meters."

"Yes."

Silence. The wind. The grass.

"Now what?" he said.

The question was the right one. Now what? The external threat was managed. The sect was relocated. The power worked outward: spectacularly, totally, the cosmic ability to rearrange reality by belief alone. Outward, everything functioned.

Inward, nothing had moved. The belief in immortality held. The autonomous warping continued. The machinery hummed. The foundation was intact.

I sat down in the grass. The field was empty. The sky was clear. The world was exactly what I believed it to be.

You walked across a field where a hundred people had stood. You didn't look at the space. You looked at me. I never decided whether that was courage or just your particular inability to be impressed by the wrong things.

That was the problem.
