The next morning I washed the rest.

My own robe. The under-layer. The sash that had been tied and untied so many times the fabric had developed a memory — a crease at the exact point where the knot sat, a softness where the tail hung, the textile autobiography of repetitive use. Xu Ran's spare shirt. The cloth we used as a pot holder. Everything that could be washed, I washed.

The river was the same one. We hadn't moved far — a half-day's walk downstream from yesterday's washing spot, the water wider here, shallower, the stones smaller and rounder. The fox-spirit had found a patch of sun on the far bank and was lying in it with the committed indolence of an animal that understood the value of warmth.

I stood in the water up to my calves. Cold. Real cold, the kind that registered in the body rather than sliding off the immortal surface like data off a screen. The fabric was heavy with water. My hands were full.

I wrung out Xu Ran's shirt. Set it on the flat rock I'd designated as the drying surface. Picked up the sash. Scrubbed. The motion was becoming familiar again — not the muscle memory of eons, but the fresh familiarity of something relearned, the satisfaction of a skill that had been dormant and was waking up.

The sash was clean. I held it.

Wet fabric, heavy, dripping. Both hands. The weight of it pulling down — not much, the sash was light even wet, but enough. The pull of gravity on water-logged cloth, the most ordinary force in the world.

I opened my hands.

The sash fell into the river.

Not dramatically — not the slow-motion, wind-caught, symbolically-charged falling of a narrative object. Quickly. Wetly. It hit the surface, sank halfway, caught the current, and began to move downstream. A piece of wet fabric in a river, doing what wet fabric in rivers does.

I watched it go.

My hands were open. Empty. The air on my wet palms. The absence of the fabric's weight — the lightness of having held something and now not holding it. Not a metaphor. Not a deliberate symbolic act. I had been holding a piece of wet cloth and I had opened my hands and the cloth had left.

The letting go was that simple.

The letting go was that hard.

Because the impulse came — reach, grab, retrieve — the automatic response of a mind and body calibrated for holding. The grip-reflex. The fist that wanted to close because fists were what hands did, because holding was the default, because millennia of holding had made holding feel like the natural state and opening feel like an aberration. The impulse was strong. The impulse was screaming.

I did not close my hands.

The sash floated. Caught on a stone, spun, freed itself, continued. Two meters downstream. Three. Moving with the current's unhurried inevitability, the pace of water that had nowhere exact to be and eternity to get there.

"Yun."

Xu Ran. Downstream. I could see him — he'd been sitting on the bank, notebook, the usual arrangement — and he was standing now, watching the sash approach, his expression the precise combination of concern and bemusement that accompanied most of her unconventional moments.

"We still need that," he said.

His voice carried the intonation of a man stating a practical fact — we need the sash, the sash is leaving, the sash should be retrieved — while also understanding that the sash was not the point. The delivery was perfect. The deadpan of a scholar who had learned to be funny by being serious, who could illuminate a moment by refusing to acknowledge its significance.

I almost laughed.

He waded in. Two steps, his boots already off from sitting on the bank, the water to his knees. He caught the sash as it drifted past, plucked it from the current with the precise, unhurried motion of a man retrieving laundry from a river, and held it up.

"Got it," he said.

The sash dripped. He dripped. The fox-spirit on the far bank lifted its head, assessed the situation, and put its head back down. Not interesting enough.

"You could have caught it," Xu Ran said.

"Yes."

"You chose not to."

I looked at my hands. Still open. Still empty. The palms cooling in the air, the water evaporating, the skin tightening as it dried.

"I chose not to close my hands," I said. "It's different."

He considered this. Standing in the river, holding a wet sash, water around his knees. The consideration was visible — the slight tilt, the micro-narrowing, the facial topography of a man processing a distinction he had not yet categorized.

"Is it?" he said.

"Choosing not to reach is still choosing. Letting go is — not choosing. It's the absence of the grip. If I had chosen to let the sash go, that would have been will. Directing the outcome through decision. But I didn't let go OF it. I stopped holding."

He looked at the sash. Looked at me. Wrung the sash out — efficiently, practically, the wringing of a man who intended to use the sash again and was not interested in letting it complete its symbolic journey to the sea.

"You stopped holding," he repeated.

"And it left."

"Because that's what wet sashes in rivers do."

"Yes."

He waded back to the bank. Spread the sash on his drying rock. Stood there for a moment, looking at the arrangement of wet fabric — his shirt, my robe, the pot cloth, the sash — with the evaluative expression of a man assessing whether the distribution of cloth-to-sun ratio was optimal.

"That's the first time," he said, "you've let something leave without reaching after it."

Not quite true. But close enough. The impulse to reach was still there — would always be there, probably, the fist's memory of being a fist. But the impulse had not become action. The hands had stayed open. The sash had gone.

The fox-spirit yawned on the far bank. The sun continued its slow, indifferent transit. The wet fabric steamed slightly in the warmth.

I stood in the river with empty hands and thought about nothing, and the nothing was not the nothing of absence but the nothing of space, the emptiness that existed between letting go and whatever came after, the pause between one state and the next that could only be occupied by waiting.

I waited.

The water flowed through.
