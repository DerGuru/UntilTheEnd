The question took three days to form.

Not because it was complex — the logic was simple, three premises stacked like stones, each one supporting the next, the conclusion resting on top with the awful certainty of something that had always been there and was only now being seen. Not because it was difficult to articulate — the words were common, the grammar was basic, the sentence was short. A child could have formed it.

It took three days because I was afraid of it.

The fear was new. Not the cultivator's fear — strategical, analytical, the measured assessment of threat and response that survival demanded. Not the wall's fear — the preemptive, autonomic, reflexive prohibition against certain kinds of knowing. This fear was personal. Mine. The fear of a woman who had arrived at the edge of a drop and could see the bottom and knew that the bottom was worse than the drop.

I walked. Ate. Slept. Functioned. The trail continued south, the path opening, the terrain cooperating with the suspicious ease of a world that was being shaped by someone who believed in clear paths. I walked through the world I was unconsciously sculpting and thought about the question I wasn't ready to ask.

Xu Ran knew. He could see the approach — the way my face changed when the thought came close, the way I stopped mid-sentence, the way my hands found each other and held, the unconscious self-grip of someone bracing for impact. He saw these things and said nothing. Cooked. Counted provisions. Discussed weather. Built the scaffolding of normalcy around a space that was anything but normal.

On the third evening, the fire was burning.

Not because I'd lit it — because I'd believed it should be burning. And the thought came, quiet and terrible: that the belief had produced the fire. That the fire had always been burning. I sat across from the flames and the flames moved and I thought about what fire was and what belief was and whether fire knew it was being believed.

The fire had gone out earlier that day. I'd put it out — unconsciously, without deciding, the way I'd been putting out and relighting fires for millennia without knowing. The fire going out and coming back — could that be my belief fluctuating? My attention wandering? My convictions shifting the way convictions shift — not dramatically, but in the small, constant adjustments that consciousness makes as it moves through the world.

The fire was back now. I'd relit it unconsciously. The fire had always been burning.

The logic arrived.

One: What if my belief shapes reality.

Two: I have always believed, at the deepest level, in the absolute, foundational certainty that constituted not my thought but my identity — I have always believed that everything I love dies.

Three: Wei died.

One. Two. Three.

The conclusion sat on top. I could see it. The way you see a shape in the dark — not in detail, not in color, not with the precision that daylight provides. But the shape was there. The outline. The terrible, simple outline of a conclusion that the premises demanded.

My lips moved.

I formed the sentence. In the air. Without voice. Without breath. Without the small physical actions that turn thought into speech. I formed the sentence the way you form a word in a language you're afraid to speak — the shape in the mouth, the presence in the throat, the readiness at the lips.

I didn't say it.

Xu Ran saw.

He was across the fire, sitting on a log, his hands on his knees. He saw my lips move. Saw the shape of the unsaid sentence. Saw the thing forming in my face — the understanding, the comprehension, the quality of a realization that spreads like cracks across glass. He saw the glass cracking.

"Yun —"

His voice. The name an anchor. The two syllables a rope thrown to someone standing at the edge of something deep and dark and honest.

"Have I killed Wei?"

Quiet. Almost inaudible. The sentence spoken in the register of confession — the voice reserved for things that are too true to be said at normal volume. The sentence I'd been building toward for three days and three years and a lifetime of not-knowing.

Have I killed Wei.

Not the cultivator who struck him. Not the circumstances that placed him in danger. Not the mortality that made him vulnerable or the power differential that made him fragile. Me.

If belief shapes reality. If my deepest belief was that everything I love dies. If I loved Wei. Then my belief — my unconscious, automatic, foundational belief — killed him. Not directly. Not with force. Not with anything that the vocabulary of violence could describe. But causally. Structurally. The way a riverbed kills by directing water.

The fire burned.

Xu Ran didn't breathe. I could see it — the held breath, the suspended respiration, the body's instinctive response to an atmosphere too charged for the ordinary exchange of gases. He heard the question. He understood the question. He understood the mathematics behind the question and the premises that supported the mathematics and the evidence that supported the premises.

He didn't answer.

The world didn't answer.

The question hung in the air between us — over the fire, through the smoke, in the space where answers were supposed to form. The space stayed empty. The question remained. Unanswered. Not because the answer was unknown but because the answer was unknowable. Because the question itself was the endpoint — the destination, not the waypoint. The question WAS the thing.

Had my belief killed Wei?

Maybe.

Maybe not.

Wei had been mortal. Fragile. A child in a world of cultivators, carrying a body that bruised easily and broke easily and died easily. He would have died anyway — eventually, inevitably, in the normal way that mortals die. The cultivator who struck him would have struck him regardless of my beliefs. The circumstances that placed him in danger existed independently of my convictions.

Or didn't they?

Or had my belief in loss CREATED the circumstances? Had the cultivator appeared BECAUSE my conviction required an instrument? Had the danger materialized BECAUSE my deepest certainty demanded that Wei die, the way my deepest certainty demanded that water flow and stones sit and fire burn?

I didn't know.

The not-knowing was the answer.

The not-knowing was the cruelest possible truth — worse than yes, worse than no. Yes would have been devastating but complete. No would have been relieving but false. Not-knowing was the middle — the ambiguity, the permanently suspended judgment, the question that would never close.

I would carry this.

Not as an answer. Not as a conclusion. As a question. Open. Permanent. The weight of maybe. The unresolvable weight of a question that could not be answered and could not be dismissed and could not be forgotten.

I sat by the fire.

The fire burned.

The question hung.
