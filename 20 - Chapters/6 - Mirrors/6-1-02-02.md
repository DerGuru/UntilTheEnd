I stopped walking.

Hadn't decided to stop. Just stopped. The way you stop when you hit a wall, when the body encounters an obstacle that the mind hasn't registered yet. One moment I was moving, feet on the trail, pack on my shoulders, the rhythm of walking filling the space between thoughts. The next moment I was standing still, mid-stride, right foot forward and left foot back and the momentum of forward motion draining from my legs like water from a tilted vessel.

The images came.

Not memories. The wall would have caught memories. Not dreams. I was awake, eyes open, the morning trail visible in all its physical detail, the pines and the stones and the path ahead clear and present and empirically undeniable. These were something else. Something that lived in the space between memory and hallucination, between seeing and imagining, between what was and what had been.

Hands. My hands, or hands that were mine in the way that an earlier draft of a sentence is still yours. Shaping something. Not sculpting, not assembling, not performing any of the physical manipulations that the word *shaping* normally describes. The hands were moving through light. The light was bending. Following the gesture. Almost obeying. Responding. The way water responds to a thrown stone, the way air responds to motion, the way reality responds to the thing that shapes it.

Creating.

The word arrived with the image, inseparable, a caption burned into the frame. Creating. Not building. Not assembling. Creating: the act of making something exist that didn't exist before, the fundamental act, the first act, the act from which all other acts descend.

I — the other I, the version in the images, the hands in the light — was creating with the concentrated focus of something that had been doing this for longer than the concept of time had existed. Ancient. Deliberate. What looked like absolute certainty about what was being made and why and how.

Four images. Maybe five. They stacked like the Gedanken-Echos, additive, each one building on the last, each one carrying more information than the frame could hold. Hands in light. Light bending. Something emerging from the bending — a shape, a structure, a principle made visible. And beneath it all, the feeling: intention. Pure, concentrated, undiluted intention, the kind that doesn't come from wanting but from knowing.

Then gone.

The images collapsed. Not erased — withdrawn. As if whoever had shown them had decided that four was enough, that more would trigger the wall, that the dosage had to be precise.

I stood on the trail. Right foot forward. Left foot back. The morning was exactly as it had been. Pines, stones, path, sky. Nothing had moved. Nothing had changed. The world was stubbornly, obstinately real.

"You stopped," Xu Ran said. Behind me. Three steps back, as always.

I looked at him. The looking took effort — the images were still resonating, their afterglow filling my vision the way bright light fills vision after you look away. The trail was there but the hands were there too, superimposed, a palimpsest of present and something-else.

"Did I?"

The question was genuine. I didn't know if I'd stopped. Didn't know how long I'd been standing. Didn't know if the pause had been a fraction of a second or a geological age, because the images had carried their own time, their own duration, their own relationship to the sequential progression of moments that mortals called chronology.

"About thirty seconds," Xu Ran said. He was watching me with the attention of a man who had seen this before — not the images, but the stopping, the absence, the brief departure of consciousness from its assigned post behind the eyes. The field had taught him what it looked like when I went somewhere else without moving.

"I saw something," I said.

I pushed it away. The instinct was automatic, the habit of dismissal, the reflex of someone who had learned that seeing things and acknowledging things and thinking about things led to the wall and the erasure and the gap. Push it away. Don't examine. Don't engage. Don't give the guardian a target.

It came back.

Not immediately. Not aggressively. But ten minutes later, walking, the rhythm of footsteps filling the space between thoughts. The images returned. Softer. Less vivid. But present. The hands. The light. The bending. The creating.

I pushed again. It returned.

Pushed. Returned.

The cycle was new. Before the crack, pushing had worked. The wall had been absolute: content dismissed was content destroyed, thoughts rejected were thoughts erased, the guardian's authority had been total and the subject's compliance had been irrelevant. But now the pushing wasn't sticking. The images were persistent, not breaking through the wall, not forcing past the guardian, but refusing to leave. Sitting outside the threshold. Waiting.

Like a cat at a closed door. Patient. Certain. Knowing that eventually the door would open, because doors always open eventually, and the thing on the other side was not hostile but simply wanted in.

I walked. The images walked with me.

The metallic taste was stronger. The teeth-vibration had settled into a constant hum, neither painful nor pleasant, just present, the sensory equivalent of a tone held too long. My jaw ached from the constant micro-resonance of bone receiving a signal it hadn't been designed to receive.

Xu Ran walked behind me. Three steps. The distance of companionship and caution. I could hear his breathing, the measured rhythm of a man who was fit enough for the trail but not so fit that the trail was effortless. Human breathing. Mortal breathing. The kind that starts and stops and counts and ends.

"You're going to tell me what you saw," he said. Not a question.

"I don't know what I saw."

"That's never stopped you before."

The thin humor. The dry, careful comedy of a man who used lightness to bridge gaps that seriousness couldn't cross. I appreciated it the way you appreciate a handrail on a steep descent, not essential, but the walking is different without it.

"Hands," I said. "Creating something. Light that bent."

He was quiet for a moment. Processing. "Your hands?"

"I don't know. Mine but not mine. Like — an earlier version."

"Earlier."

"Older. Before."

The word hung. *Before* was a word that had been accumulating weight since the crack, since the feeling, since the reflection that smiled before I did and carried the warmth of something that wanted me to live. Before implied a time before my time. Before implied that I had existed before I had existed. Before implied things about the nature of my being that the wall was specifically designed to prevent me from thinking about.

The wall did not intervene.

The headache — the preemptive warning, the guardian's gentle refusal — did not arrive. I'd said *before* and *creating* and *older* and the wall had done nothing. Either the words were below its threshold or the wall was losing its grip or the thing behind the wall had decided that these words were permitted.

Had decided that I was allowed to approach.

I walked. The images pulsed, faint, persistent, the visual equivalent of the feeling in my chest, present without clarity, real without resolution. The fox-spirit padded behind Xu Ran, amber eyes tracking the trail. The morning opened into day. The clouds thinned.

Something was reaching toward me from the other side of the crack. Something that had been there since before there was a there. Something that was showing me its hands because its hands were my hands, and the creating was my creating, and the light that bent was the light that I bent, and the only thing between me and the understanding was a wall that was thinning with every step.

I pushed the images away one more time. Habit. Reflex.

They came back.

I let them stay.
