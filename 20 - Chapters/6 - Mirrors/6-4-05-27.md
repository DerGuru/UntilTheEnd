My knees gave.

Not from weakness — from weight. The weight of eons arriving all at once, the accumulated mass of a history that was no longer hidden, no longer compressed behind the wall, no longer managed and curated and rationed by a guardian that had lost its authority. The weight arrived, and my knees received it, and the receiving was surrender.

I knelt in the water. It rose to my hips — cold, immediate, the physical insistence of a river that didn't care about revelations or transformations or the cosmic significance of the woman kneeling in its current. The fabric of my clothes spread around me, darkening with water, the material performing its simple chemistry of absorption.

Xu Ran stepped toward the bank's edge. Then stopped.

I felt the stopping. Felt the decision — the instinct that told him to approach, to help, to extend the human hand that had anchored me through every crisis. And the counter-instinct — the deeper knowledge, the observer's wisdom, that told him this was not a crisis to be interrupted. That what was happening inside me was something that needed to complete. That the approach would break it.

He stayed on the bank.

The memory came.

Not a single memory — all of them. The entire sequence, from creation to now, from the place before places to the river where I knelt. Not chronological — emotional. The memories arrived in the order of their impact, their weight, their gravitational pull on the center of what I was.

Creation first. My hands — the original hands, the hands before the hands I had now — shaping light into form, believing formlessness into structure, saying *exist* and watching existence comply. The solitude of that act. The absolute, cosmic, incomprehensible solitude of a self creating before there was anything to create FOR. Creating because creating was what I was. Creating because the alternative was the ending I feared.

Then the fear. The fear that preceded immortality — the vertigo of a consciousness confronting its own potential nonexistence. The dizziness. The grasping. The desperate, irrational, overwhelmingly powerful belief that I MUST NOT END. And the belief becoming true. Becoming the foundation. Becoming the bedrock upon which everything else was built — world, form, time, identity.

Then the millennia. The walking. Faces — thousands of faces, faces I'd seen and spoken to and walked past and forgotten. The forgetting was the worst. Not the wall's erasure — the natural, organic forgetting of a mind that had lived so long that most of its content had been overwritten by newer content. I'd forgotten more lives than most civilizations had produced. I'd forgotten languages, cultures, continents, epochs. The forgetting was not a failure of memory — it was a feature of duration.

Wei's face was there. Among the thousands, exact, unforgettable, the one face that the wall could not erase because the love that produced it was stronger than the mechanism that managed it. His face. Small. Angry. The jaw set in the universal geometry of refusal. *You're standing in my light.*

His death was there. Again. The gate. The fall. The silence. The belief that failed — *he will live* — defeated by the deeper belief — *everything I love dies*. The structural, mechanical, systematic murder-that-wasn't-murder. The pattern.

My pattern.

The memories washed through me. Not sequentially — simultaneously. Each one occupying its own frequency, its own channel, the way a river carries a thousand different currents within a single flow. I was all of them at once — the creator, the afraid, the walking, the loving, the losing, the forgetting.

My breath went shallow.

The river — the river I was kneeling in, the real river, the now-river — was still. I noticed this in the way you notice details during seismic events — peripherally, absurdly, the mind cataloging irrelevance while the main process consumes everything. The river had stopped flowing. The current had stilled. The water around my knees was motionless — not frozen, not blocked, but still. As if the river had stopped breathing.

I'd done that. Unconsciously. The belief-engine, unfrozen by the knowledge, reactivated by the certainty, had produced its first post-twist edit: the river stilled because I was kneeling in it and the kneeling required stillness and the belief required compliance.

I didn't drown as the water settled.

Of course I didn't. Because I believed I couldn't drown. And the belief was the reality and the reality was the belief and the circularity was the point.

The irony was not subtle. The irony was structural, architectural, foundational — a woman who couldn't die because she believed she couldn't die, kneeling in a river that couldn't flow because she believed in stillness, remembering a life that she'd created because she believed in creation.

The irony was me.

On the bank, Xu Ran sat. He didn't approach. He'd positioned himself at the water's edge — close enough to reach, far enough to not intrude. His notebook was on his knees: open, receiving, documenting. His pen moved with the desperate speed of a man trying to catch a flood in a cup.

He was witnessing the longest memory of the series.

He was witnessing me remembering myself.

The weight settled. The memories didn't end — they didn't have endings, because the timeline they described was ongoing, was still happening, would continue happening until I stopped believing it would. But the acute phase passed. The flood receded. The memories took their positions — not behind the wall anymore, not hidden or curated or managed, but present. Arranged around me like furniture in a room I'd just entered. My room. My furniture. My life.

All of it.

My breath steadied. The river resumed — slowly, tentatively, the current returning with the caution of a thing that had been interrupted by something it didn't understand. The water moved against my knees. Cold. Real.

My eyes were closed. I opened them.

Light. Water. Sky. Trees. Stones. Xu Ran.

Everything was the same.

Everything was different.
