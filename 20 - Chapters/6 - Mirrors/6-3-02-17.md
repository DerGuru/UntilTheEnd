We tested everything.

The water first. A small stream, one of the mountain's tributaries, flowing east, following gravity, obeying the laws. Xu Ran stood downstream. I stood at the bank.

"The water flows there," I said. Pointing west. Uphill.

The water flowed there. Had always flowed there. The rocks at the bank were worn in the direction of westward flow, the erosion pattern consistent with decades of water moving uphill. The fish — there were fish, tiny, barely visible — swam westward with the current, their bodies aligned to the new direction as if they'd never known another.

Xu Ran crouched. Watched the water. His face did the thing it did when data contradicted framework: the micro-adjustments, the involuntary recalibration, the face of a man whose brain was rebuilding a room while he was standing in it.

"You didn't say 'I want the water to flow west,'" he said.

"No."

"You said 'the water flows there.' Present tense."

"Yes."

"And it does."

"It always did."

We built the fire. Xu Ran lit it with flint and steel, the deliberate, physical method, the mortal's approach. The flames caught, grew, stabilized. The fire burned.

"The fire is out," I said.

Darkness.

The instantaneous, absolute darkness of a fire that had never existed. No coals. No smoke. No residual heat. The ground where the fire had been was cold, as if nothing had burned there. As if nothing had ever burned there.

Xu Ran stood in the dark. I could hear his breathing, the sharp intake of someone who had been looking at light and was now looking at the absence of light and the transition between the two had been, for him, experienced as continuity. He didn't remember the fire. He remembered the darkness. He remembered sitting by an unlit fire pit, waiting for someone to start a fire.

"Did you —" he started.

"I put the fire out."

"There was no fire."

The contradiction again. His memory — rewritten, retroactive, absolute — said no fire. My memory, unrewritten, the only copy of the previous version, said fire. Both true. Both real. Both incompatible.

I relit the fire. Not with flint — with belief. *The fire is burning.* The flames appeared with the retroactive certainty of flames that had been burning for minutes. The wood was charred. The heat was established. The smoke rose with the continuity of smoke that had been rising since the fire began, which was several minutes ago, which was right now, which was both.

Xu Ran sat by the fire. His face was lit by the flames — and the flames' light showed me something I hadn't expected. Fear.

Not panic. Not the bright, sharp fear of the villagers in the square. The deep, slow fear of comprehension. The fear of a man who understood what he was seeing and understood what it meant and understood that the meaning didn't stop at stones and water and fire but extended outward, in every direction, to encompass everything.

"Can you warm my tea?" he said.

The question was half-humor, half-test. He held his cup toward me: clay, cooling, the last of the morning's brew now lukewarm with the tepidity of tea that had been ignored for too long.

I looked at the cup. The tea was hot.

Steam rose. The cup's surface was warm. I could see the heat in Xu Ran's sudden adjustment of grip, the loosening of fingers that had been holding cool clay and were now holding warm clay. He looked at the steam. Looked at me.

Took a sip.

"Okay," he said.

Pause.

"Okay, that scares me."

The sentence was honest. Delivered without the usual protective irony, without the bridge-humor, without the lightness that normally carried his observations across the gap between understanding and articulating. Plain. Direct. Scared.

Because it wasn't tricks. It wasn't a repertoire of exact abilities: stone-moving, water-redirecting, fire-managing, tea-warming. It was starting to look like everything. Like my beliefs shaped reality. All of it. Always. Every conviction I held, every certainty I maintained, every deep assumption about how the world worked. All of it might be operative. All of it might be shaping. All of it might have been shaping, unconsciously, automatically, for millennia.

The healings. The coincidences. The protections. The lucky breaks. The paths that opened. The weather that changed. The forty-seven instances Xu Ran had counted. All of it — every single one — was the output of a belief I didn't know I was running.

"Everything," I said. The word was flat. Just flat. The flatness of someone stating the obvious after the obvious has become so large that it stops being statable.

"Everything," he agreed.

The fire burned. The tea steamed. The water flowed uphill somewhere behind us, carrying its retroactive fish in its retroactive direction. The stones sat in their new positions with their retroactive moss and their retroactive earth.

Everything.

The word opened the door. The door I'd been approaching since the beginning, since the metallic taste and the teeth-vibration and the images of hands creating. The door that led to the question. The door behind which the question waited — patient, inevitable, the question that the tests and the evidence and the everything had been building toward since the moment I'd believed thirty cultivators somewhere else.

If belief equals reality.

And I have believed things my whole life.

Then everything I've believed has been real.

Including —

I stopped thinking. Not the wall — me. My own decision, my own restraint, my own recognition that the thought waiting at the end of that sentence was not a thought I could think standing by a fire holding a cup of tea and watching steam rise. That thought needed preparation. That thought needed ground.

That thought needed courage I hadn't accumulated yet.

Xu Ran watched me stop thinking. He saw it: the moment when the sentence's trajectory became visible, when the implication crystallized, when the destination of the logic became clear enough to abort.

He didn't push.

He drank his tea.

It was warm.
