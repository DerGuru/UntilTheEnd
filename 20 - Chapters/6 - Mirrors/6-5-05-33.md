I sat in the field.

The grass was growing. Not visibly, not the time-lapse acceleration of plant biology, but the grass around me was taller than the grass further away. The blades closest to where I sat were longer, greener, more vital. As if my presence nourished them. As if the excess energy of my belief-engine, running continuously, involuntarily, leaked into the ground and fed whatever was nearest.

Where a hundred people had stood, nature was reclaiming. Already. The faint impressions of feet were filling. The grass was reaching. Give it a week and there would be no evidence that anyone had been here. Give it a day and the evidence would be ambiguous. Give it an hour and the retroactive revision would be complete: the field would always have been empty, the grass would always have been this tall, the wildflowers would always have grown in this pattern.

I let the memories come.

The creation memory had been delivered, complete, in the river. Wei's death had been delivered, complete, in the night. These were the other memories. The ones in between. The thousands of years between creating and now, the accumulated lifetime of a self that had believed itself into immortality and then walked the world it had believed into existence.

Faces.

Hundreds. Incoming like a tide. Each one exact — a jaw, a voice, a gesture. A woman who laughed too loudly in a market I couldn't place. A child who looked like Wei but wasn't, three centuries earlier or five, the chronology dissolving under the weight of quantity. An old man who told me his name and I'd forgotten the name before he finished saying it. A teacher who taught me a cultivation technique that I hadn't needed because the cultivation was irrelevant, had always been irrelevant, was a framework I'd been using to explain something that frameworks couldn't contain.

Gone. All of them. Dead. The mortality that I couldn't share, the ending that I couldn't reach, the natural conclusion that every face I'd ever seen had arrived at while I continued. While I walked. While I believed in my own continuation and the continuation continued and the faces stopped and I walked past them the way I walked past stones and trees and rivers.

The pattern Xu Ran had named.

Proximity. Attachment. Loss. Continuation. The four-beat rhythm of my existence: get close, feel something, lose it, keep going. Repeat. Across centuries. Across millennia. The pattern was not chosen. The pattern was structural — the inevitable product of a immortal consciousness moving through a mortal world. Things near me lived. Things near me died. I continued.

And every time — every loss, every face that stopped, every name forgotten — the deep belief deepened. *Everything I love dies.* Not because the belief was true but because the evidence accumulated. Each loss confirmed the conviction. Each confirmation strengthened the belief. Each strengthening made the next loss more likely because the belief shaped reality and reality produced loss and loss confirmed the belief.

A spiral. Downward. Self-reinforcing. Millennia deep.

Xu Ran sat beside me. He'd arrived without announcement — walked across the field, settled in the grass, placed a bowl of rice between us. The bowl sat there. The rice cooled. Neither of us touched it.

He didn't speak.

The silence was his gift. The practiced, intentional silence of a man who understood that some processes needed witness but not commentary. He sat. He was present. The fact of his presence — mortal, temporary, the warmth of a human body aging in real time — was the anchor.

The faces continued. I let them come. Let them pass. Let the tide of a thousand years wash through me and recede.

Loneliness.

Not as feeling — as condition. The way cold is a condition, the way gravity is a condition. So comprehensive that it wasn't experienced as loneliness because the experiencer had no reference point for non-loneliness. I hadn't known I was lonely because I'd always been lonely because immortality was loneliness and loneliness was immortality and the two were the same condition described in different vocabularies.

The rice cooled.

The shadows moved. Time passed — mortal time, human time, time measured by the angle of light and the temperature of rice and the slow, reliable progression of a day through its phases. I sat and the memories flowed and the field was empty and the grass grew and the world continued its operations around a woman who was remembering how long she'd been alone.

Eventually, the tide receded.

Never completely. Memories don't end, they just lower their volume. But the acute phase passed. The faces dimmed. The losses stepped back from the foreground. I was left with the residue — the emotional sediment of millennia compressed into an afternoon, the exhaustion of a consciousness that had just reviewed its entire portfolio and found it heavy.

The rice was cold.

Xu Ran hadn't touched it either. He'd sat, present, patient, through the entire tide. His face was tired. Not his tired. MY tired, reflected in his face, the empathetic exhaustion of a witness who couldn't share the experience but could share the weight.

I picked up the bowl. The rice was cold but rice is rice.

I ate.
