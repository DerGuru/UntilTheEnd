The fourth attacker came from the south.

Not through the east gate — around. The flanking position I'd tracked: two signatures circling. One held position. The other broke toward Wei's right, using the wall's curve as cover.

Wei felt it. Turned. One hand on sword, one projecting a qi-pulse that caught the flanker mid-approach and slammed him into the wall. Stone cracked. The attacker slid down. Did not get up immediately.

Wei turned back east. The specialist had regrouped. Two more behind him — fresh, unhurt. Reserves.

They came together. Two at Wei's front, one working left. Coordinated — complementary timing designed to force split attention.

Wei met them.

His movement changed. The transition from individual combat to multiple-opponent awareness — wider stance, peripheral vision, the sword working arcs instead of lines. Each cut served two purposes: offensive and defensive, the economy of motion that was the only viable strategy when outnumbered.

He caught one. Blade across the forearm — deep, debilitating. The attacker dropped his weapon. Retreated.

The second pressed. Hard. Forcing Wei backward, step by step, toward the gate. The third circled.

Wei's core flared.

Brighter. Pulsing. The qi-clock ticking. Each burst of full-power combat accelerating what was already accelerating. He was burning his core to fight, and fighting to burn.

He broke the press. A surge — raw, unrefined. Cost more than it achieved. But it worked. The attacker stumbled. Wei followed. Cut. The attacker fell.

The third: arrived. Engaged. Wei blocked. Countered. Missed.

The attacker hit him. Side. Below the ribs. Qi-enhanced impact. Wei staggered. One knee.

He got up.

Blood at the corner of his mouth. He got up.

He killed this one.

Not by choice. The angle — the attacker lunging as Wei rose, trajectories converging, Wei's sword up in defense that became offense as momentum carried the attacker forward into the edge. Through the qi-guard. Through.

The attacker's eyes went wide with surprise.

Wei looked at the man sliding off his blade — the moment when a boy who had been fighting with controlled precision crossed the line between those two categories. A crossing that was permanent.

He pulled the blade free and turned — more were coming.

From the east, from the positions Guo had arranged: more. Fresh bodies rotating into contact. The attrition that relied on one fact — Wei was one, and one had limits.

The sound reached me from the edge.

Not the combat — behind it. A rhythm. Barely audible. Tapping.

*Knock.*

One. Against wood or bone.

*Knock.*

Two.

I waited for the third.

It did not come. Not yet.

Two knocks. Two phases. The frontal assault. The flanking. Both active. Both achieving their purpose — not victory but expenditure. Making Wei burn his reserves. Spending the finite resource that was accelerating toward empty.

Guo was at the edge. Invisible. Patient. Counting.

Not Wei's kills. Not his own losses.

Wei's flares.

Each core-burst: counted. Each discharge: noted. A commander who understood that the target was not the boy's skill but the boy's fuel. And the fuel was running out. And running out was the strategy.

I could feel Wei's core from the west wall. The oscillation — bright, dim, bright, dim — each peak lower than the last, each trough deeper. The curve I'd tracked for weeks, compressed now into minutes.

He was winning every fight and losing the war.

And the war was inside him.

And inside him was the place I had chosen not to go.
