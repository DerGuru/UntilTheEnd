The third round.

The lynx came low — a different approach, the adaptation of a predator that had learned from two exchanges that high attacks were met with evasion. Low was the angle this target hadn't defended. Animals learned fast when qi-enhanced. The intelligence wasn't human but it was sufficient.

Wei adjusted, but too late. The fraction of a second between anticipation and reaction — that fraction was the gap, and the gap was the claw.

The paw caught him across the shoulder, diagonal and deep.

I heard the sound from eight meters — fabric tearing, then something wetter, skin separating under force, with the clarity of someone whose perception was designed for detail and was currently producing nausea.

Blood came immediate, red and hot and vivid.

Wei screamed — short, one syllable. His body had been breached and pain was a surprise, always a surprise, even with training, because training was theoretical and pain was not.

Then silence as his jaw closed, teeth together. He chose to stop screaming through willpower alone.

He didn't step back.

That was the thing — he didn't retreat. His left arm hung, the struck arm bleeding from shoulder to elbow, but his right arm came up with qi concentrated in the palm, bright, brighter than before. The brightness of emergency, of a body that was hurt and responding by pushing harder.

The lynx recovered. Turned. Came again.

Wei met it with his right palm forward — a qi-pulse, not trained modulation but raw, unfiltered discharge. A fourteen-year-old whose left shoulder was open and whose right hand was everything.

The strike hit the lynx square in center mass.

The animal staggered. A real stagger — not annoyance but physical disruption. A qi-strike powered by pain and the fuel that only desperation provided.

The lynx shook. Its qi-lines flickered — visible disruption. For two seconds, maybe three, the animal's enhancement wavered.

Wei pressed. Another strike. Same hand. Same arm. Channeling anything he had, expensive and unsustainable, maintaining it because it was the only option.

"Stay back," he said. Through his teeth. To me. Without looking.

The lynx retreated two steps, three, its posture shifting from predator to uncertain — a territorial animal encountering something it couldn't categorize: a bleeding boy whose qi was too bright.

I stood eight meters away, my mouth full of blood, crescents from my fingernails cut into my palms, my feet planted and rooted, preventing myself from moving by making my body heavy.

Wei looked at me.

One glance. From across the clearing. Through the blood and the sweat and the torn sleeve. His eyes met mine and in his eyes was the word: no.

Not spoken. Communicated in the frequency that existed between us — the channel built by years of proximity and silence.

*I can do this.*

I stayed.

The cost of staying was the blood on my tongue and the crescents in my palms. Restraint in a body built for action. Not-acting as the hardest thing I had done.

*Harder than fighting. Harder than running. Harder than any of it.*

The lynx steadied. Its qi-lines re-established. It hadn't retreated far enough. Still here. Still the fight.

Wei's left arm was dripping, not critical yet but accumulating.

He breathed and set his stance, right arm up, left arm held close.

The lynx gathered. Muscles bunching under qi-lit fur.

Wei breathed out. Slow. Ready.
