Night.

No fire. The absence of fire that was not darkness but statement — the absence that said: no one sits opposite. No one waits for the warmth. No one complains about the smoke or the positioning or the kindling being wet again.

I had always made fire. Every night. The routine that was the anchor: survive the night by filling the night with tasks. Fire: task one. Tea: task two. Qi-practice: task three. The sequential occupation of hours that converted darkness from threat to schedule.

Wei had expected fire. Had assumed it. Had sat down at the place where fire would be and waited for it to appear. Fire appearing was the constant. I was the constant. Reliable.

No one expected fire now.

The forest: dark. The sky: dark. The clearing where I sat: dark. The brown circle under me: invisible in darkness, the death-radius continuing unseen.

I sat. In the dark. Without fire.

And then — from somewhere deep, somewhere below conscious access — something.

Not a memory. Not the archive opening. Not the pattern that had stopped.

An imprint. A shape felt rather than recalled — the impression a person left in the architecture of another person. Permanent alteration, not departure.

He would have hated this.

Not the grief. Not the darkness. Not the sitting. The giving up. A woman sitting in a dead clearing without fire, without food, without the basic operations of survival. He would have hated it.

"What do you mean, you give up? Are you STUPID?"

Not a voice. Not a hallucination. Not the ghost-hearing that grief produced in people who wanted to hear. An imprint — the shape of his character pressed into my consciousness by years of proximity. His stubbornness. His refusal. His constitutive inability to accept that things ended.

He was stubborn. That was his core quality — not qi, not talent, not the potential the sect had valued. Stubbornness. The irrational, magnificent stubbornness of a person who looked at every closed door and said: that's a suggestion, not a fact.

He would have looked at me — sitting, dark, fireless — and his face would have made the expression that fourteen-year-old boys made when they saw something they considered wrong. The compressed lips. The narrowed eyes. The chin: forward, the angle of challenge.

"Get up."

The imprint. His shape. Not a voice.

And the thing that responded — the thing inside me that responded to his non-voice with something that was not a feeling but a reaction — was:

Not hope. Hope was the word people used when the future seemed possible. This was not that.

Refusal.

The refusal to give the universe the satisfaction of her stopping. The refusal to let the thing that had taken him also take the thing he had left — the imprint, the stubbornness, the echo of a character so forceful that the echo survived the source.

He would not have wanted this.

And not-wanting was not enough. But it was something. And something was the difference between sitting in the dark and standing in the dark. And standing was the difference between this night and every night after.

I did not light a fire.

But I did not leave. The clearing. The sitting. The position that could become either: permanent or temporary. And the distinction between the two was the choice the imprint demanded. Not permanent. Not this. Not you. Not like this.

A coal. In the dark. Not lit — but not cold. The temperature of something that had been burning and that had stopped burning but that retained the heat. The possibility: not tonight. But maybe.

Not tonight.

But maybe.
