Evening.

The kitchen. Clay walls, wooden table, two cups, a pot. The table had a gouge near the edge where Wei had dropped a blade during an indoor demonstration I had not sanctioned and that he had conducted anyway.

He stood. I sat.

"There was someone at the market. From a sect. Iron Lotus."

I looked up. Not because I didn't know â€” I knew. I'd known since the herb stall, since the chrysanthemum, since the thirty minutes of conversation I'd pretended not to hear. I looked up because looking up was the performance of learning something. He needed to be the one telling me.

"He said my talent isâ€”"

"Wasted?"

He blinked. His prepared speech had been anticipated, and the anticipation was both flattering and annoyingâ€”approximately 40/60 in favor of annoying, because anticipation was also control.

"â€”unusual."

"That's a different word."

"It's the word he used."

Silence. A conversation happening in two registers â€” the audible one, in which information was being exchanged, and the sub-audible one, in which something much larger was moving between us, tectonic, slow.

"They offer training. Real masters. Not justâ€”"

He stopped.

The air changed. The pressure of the unsaid. The shape of the absent syllable that existed in his mouth and that he chose, at the last possible moment, not to release.

Not just you.

Three words. One pronoun. The pronoun that was me â€” the acquaintance, the teacher, the whatever-I-was that had no title because titles were for relationships that had definitions and ours had zero. The zero was intentional. The intentional was mine. And mine was a choice I was now paying for.

"The what," I said. Flat.

He looked at the table. The gouge.

"They offer training," he said. Quietly. "That's all I'm saying."

"Good."

One word. The word that meant: I've heard you, I've filed you, and the filing is the response.

He looked at me. Fourteen. Brown eyes. Reading me the way he read everything â€” quickly, accurately, with the instinct from years of proximity to someone whose emotions were expressed in micro-adjustments rather than statements.

"You're angry."

"No."

"You're something."

True. I was something. The something between angry and afraid that had no name because naming it required the kind of self-knowledge I had in abundance but chose not to apply to this. Not yet. Not in this kitchen.

"I'm drinking tea," I said.

He almost smiled. The almost that said: I know you're deflecting, and I know why, and I'm going to let you.

"Okay," he said.

"Okay."

He sat. Poured himself tea. Drank. Looked at the table. Looked at me. Looked at the table.

"I'm not going," he said. "I'm just â€” I'm telling you."

"I know."

"You always know."

"Not always."

He stood. Stretched. Went to his room.

I sat. The kitchen. The table. The gouge. The tea â€” cold, because. The chrysanthemum, unused, sitting on the counter in a paper bag.

Not just you.

I heard it. In the quiet. In the kitchen at night where nothing happened and everything was about to.

I drank my tea. The cold version. The only version.
