It was evening, when we arrived at our kitchen — clay walls, a wooden table, two cups and a pot. The table had a gouge near the edge where Wei had dropped a blade during an indoor demonstration I had not sanctioned and that he had conducted anyway.

He stood while I sat.

"The Iron Lotus guy."

Not a question. Not an announcement. The opening move of a conversation he'd been assembling on the walk home — two hours of silence used as preparation.

I looked up. He knew I'd heard everything. I knew he knew. The pretense of informing had been skipped, which meant this was something else: not telling, but asking. Permission to discuss. Permission to take it seriously.

"His word was 'wasted,'" I said.

"'Unusual.' He said unusual." 

"That's a different word."

"It's the word he used."

Silence. A conversation happening in two registers — the audible one, in which information was being exchanged, and the sub-audible one, in which something much larger was moving between us. Tectonic and slow.

"They offer training. Real masters. Not just—"

He stopped.

The air changed — the pressure of the unsaid, the shape of the absent syllable that existed in his mouth and that he chose, at the last possible moment, not to release.

Not just you.

Three words. One pronoun. The pronoun that was me — the acquaintance, the teacher, the whatever-I-was that had no title because titles were for relationships that had definitions, and ours had none. The absence was intentional. The intentional was mine. And I was now paying for it.

"The what," I said. Flat.

He looked at the table. The gouge.

"They offer training," he said. Quietly. "That's all I'm saying."

"Good."

One word. The word that meant: I've heard you, I've filed you, and the filing is the response.

He looked at me. Fourteen. Brown eyes. Reading me the way he read everything — quickly, accurately, with the instinct from years of proximity to someone whose emotions were expressed in micro-adjustments rather than statements.

"You're angry."

"No."

"You're something."

True. I was something. Not yet named. Not in this kitchen.

"I'm drinking tea," I said.

He almost smiled. The almost that said: I know you're deflecting, and I know why, and I'm going to let you.

"Okay," he said.

"Okay."

He sat down and poured himself tea. Drank. Looked at the table, then at me, then at the table again.

"I'm not going," he said. "I'm just — I'm telling you."

"I know."

"You always know."

"Not always."

He stood, stretched, and went to his room.

I sat in the kitchen with the table and the gouge and the tea — cold, because — and the chrysanthemum sitting unused on the counter in a paper bag.

Not just you.

I heard it. In the quiet. In the kitchen at night where nothing happened and everything was about to.

I drank my tea. The cold version. The only version.
