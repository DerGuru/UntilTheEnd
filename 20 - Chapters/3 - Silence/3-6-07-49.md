I was beside him. I don't remember the wall, the distance, the descent. The space between standing on the wall and kneeling in the dirt was absent — not forgotten but nonexistent. A body that had moved without consulting the mind, instantaneous because instantaneous was the only speed available.

He was on his back with his arms out and legs straight.

His hands were open, palms up, the skin torn along the qi-channels. Blood — real blood, dark, mixing with qi-residue that was translucent and cooling.

His chest was still. The shirt — the light was gone. The fabric that had been illuminated from within for weeks — from the door, from across the room, from wherever you stood near this body — was just fabric now. Cotton. Grey, originally white. The stain where tea had spilled on Tuesday. The tear at the shoulder where the felsluchs had clawed and the claw had healed to a scar.

The scar was there. Diagonal. Across the shoulder. White against skin that was still warm because warmth took time to leave.

His face was young.

Fourteen.

The angles of jaw that had been changing — the transition from child to not-child that adolescence performed in increments, one millimeter per week. The angles were there, half-formed. The nose was his father's, probably, and the chin was someone's — features that belonged to the person who had lived behind them and was no longer living.

His eyes were open.

Staring. At the sky. The grey sky of the grey morning that I had noted and that he had not noted because noting mornings was not his function. His function was: fight, run, shout, live.

The grey reflected in his eyes. Iris and fluid that caught light the way mirrors caught it. His eyes: catching the sky he was no longer seeing.

I knelt beside him, closer than I normally positioned.

My knee pressed into the dirt — the same dirt he lay in, the same ground that the false scout had lain in, the same open terrain Guo had designated as the killzone. Dirt, under my knee, getting into the fabric.

A scratch. On my forearm. Left. From the wall — the descent, the rough stone, the speed that had not accounted for surface texture. Small. Not painful. Irrelevant.

It closed. As I knelt there. The skin drawing together, the cells reconnecting. The healing that my body performed automatically, unconsciously — not healing but regeneration. Immortal meant: I heal. Always. From everything. Without trying. Without asking. Without consent.

The scratch was gone in seconds, the skin smooth, as if nothing had happened — as if the wall and the descent and the speed had not occurred.

His body lay there.

The torn hands were not healing. The qi-channel ruptures along his palms: open. The blood: still emerging, slowly — residual pressure, a system that had not yet fully stopped because stopping was a process and the process took minutes.

I healed. He didn't.

I did not touch his face.

My hand stayed at my side. Reaching would make the losing real.

I did not touch his face.

His hair was sweaty, flattened against his forehead — post-combat hair. I had seen it after training, after the felsluchs, after every physical effort. This configuration identical to those. This configuration: the last one.

The boy behind us: Shen. Alive. Crying. I could see him in peripheral vision — twelve years old, unhurt. A child who had witnessed something children should not witness.

The silence continued. The world: soundless. Visual information without auditory accompaniment. The shutdown that trauma performed on bodies experiencing it, selective, choosing sound.

I knelt beside Wei.

His core was dark — not dim, not flickering, not the oscillation I had tracked. Dark, the absence of qi-signature that occurred when the thing producing the signature ceased to produce. A cold body, a dark core, an empty channel system.

The word for this was dead.
