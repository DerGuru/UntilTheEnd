Night.

"Yun?" His voice already half-dissolved by sleep.

"What."

"Was it good? The fight?"

I looked at him. The scar on his shoulder — thirty hours old. Already part of him.

"You survived," I said. "That's the standard."

"Terrible standard." He smiled without opening his eyes. Then the smile softened, and softened further, and was sleep.

The sleep that followed victory — deeper, heavier, the dense quality of a body that had fought and won and celebrated. Processing all three through unconsciousness. The body's reward.

His face: relaxed. The scar visible above the blanket — already integrated into the visual syntax of: this is Wei, this is what Wei has done, this is the evidence.

I knelt.

The nightly arrangement. Knees on floor, hand hovering, the two-centimeter gap. A ritual that had become routine, and a routine that organized my nights into their component parts: monitor, count, catalog. Worry, translated into precision.

His core.

Like a small star. That was the image — the comparison that my perception produced and that was not metaphor but description. A star: a point-source of light emitting at frequencies that were visible in the qi-spectrum and that were warm and golden and persistent and that were, in the most literal sense available, luminous.

The glow pushed through his shirt. Through the fabric, through the threads, through what should have been opaque. His core emitted at a frequency that fabric couldn't contain, a pitch that was climbing, and the climbing was data.

I counted.

Three.

Four.

Three.

Four.

Irregular.

New.

The irregularity was the new information. The twitches — the micro-contractions of his core's stability — had been consistent before. A rhythm. Two per minute, then three, then four. Regular, predictable, the kind of escalation you could track and forecast.

This — the alternating, the three-four-three-four — was not regular. Compensation was failing. The body's quiet self-correction had become labored, deliberate, visible. A healthy core kept equilibrium without effort. His was working harder to produce the same result.

I pulled my hand back.

He shifted. Murmured something — a half-word, sleep-blurred, that might have been my name.

"I'm here," I said. The reflex of a thousand bedsides.

He settled. His breathing evened.

His blanket. I tucked it. Higher. Around his shoulders, around his chest — the careful wrapping that was the only language I had for the thing I couldn't say. The count. The trajectory. The word I wouldn't finish.

Like tucking a child. Like tucking everyone. I had done this a thousand times. More. Beside beds for longer than beds had existed in their current form — furs and blankets and woven mats, whatever the era provided. I stay. I cover. I watch.

I went outside.

Moon. Stars. The settlement: dark, except for the ember-glow of banked fires and the light from one window three houses down where Lao Chen was probably talking to a blade. The blade was probably not responding. That was metal's appeal.

The garden. Three pots. Moonlit. The dock grass, the nettle-cousin, the lemongrass. Vertical, committed, wrong-wrong-right. Wei's botanical arrangement.

Two stones. The blade fragment. Moon on metal.

I stood.

Breathed. The breath of someone who didn't need to breathe. A performance of humanity. A comfort: if I breathe, I am here, and here is the garden, and the garden has three pots, and the pots have plants, and the plants are his.

*Irregular. That's new. Irregular means his core is no longer compensating evenly. The overload is distributing unevenly across the qi-channels. That means—*

I lifted my tea. Cold. Drank. The cold liquid moving through a body that didn't need it. Irrelevant — the ritual needed it. The ritual was the structure. The structure was the night.

*That means the fracture lines are developing asymmetrically. It means when the break comes it won't be clean. It won't be a shutdown. It will be—*

I stopped.

Stars. This latitude, this season, this night. Indifferent. The indifference of light that had traveled for years to arrive at a garden where a woman stood with cold tea and a count and a thought she wouldn't finish.

*Wei is different. He must be different.*

*Everyone I've lost was different.*

*You said that once. "I'm different." You meant it. So did I.*

That one arrived uninvited. The thought that I hadn't planned and hadn't authorized and that came from the place where unauthorized thoughts lived, which was: the truth. The unrehearsed, unedited truth that existed beneath the principles and the philosophies and the gambles and that said: you have been here before and before is the pattern and the pattern is the prediction and the prediction is the thing you're holding and holding is the weight and the weight is the night and the night is long.

I drank my tea. Watched the stars. Watched the garden. Watched the settlement sleep.

Inside: the small star. His core. Glowing, twitching, three-four-three-four, irregular, bright, beautiful.

I stayed.

Then — between one breath and the next — five.

Not three-four. Five. A single spike, sharp and bright and wrong, before the pattern resumed its broken rhythm. As if the five had never happened.

It had happened.

I set down my tea. Went inside. Knelt beside him again.

His face: peaceful. His core: three. Four. Three. Four. Steady again. Almost convincing.

"How long," I whispered. Not to him. Not a question — a question expects an answer. This expected nothing. This was weight, shaped like words.

His core pulsed. The small star burned. And somewhere in the space between three and four and five, the night held its breath.

I held mine with it.
