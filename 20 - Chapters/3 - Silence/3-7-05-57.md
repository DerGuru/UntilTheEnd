At the edge, fifty paces away.

A signature — broken, the frequency of a core shattered by something other than death, a forced disruption that produced a signature like a bell hit wrong, audible in the overtones.

Xu Ran.

He was standing in his torn coat at the edge of the clearing where I had stopped — the clearing a consequence of my stopping, the trees around it intact but the grass beneath me brown and dead.

He saw me and I saw him — peripheral, unimportant, another body in a world of bodies that either lived or didn't.

He felt the aura.

I could see the physical response — his face going pale, then green with nausea. His hands shook, not from cold but from the qi-emission hitting his already-broken system, additional stress on a structure with no tolerance for additional stress.

Blood came in his mouth, the capillary disruption. He spat sideways, discreetly — the gesture of a man who maintained propriety even while his body rejected proximity.

He stayed — at fifty paces, at the edge of the radius, here, present, enduring. The trembling was continuous, the nausea continuous, the blood-taste continuous. He endured all of it by clenching his jaw and standing.

He looked at me.

I didn't look back. His presence registered the way weather registered — atmospheric, environmental, a condition of the space rather than an occupant.

He understood something. The shape of loss visible in the shape of a woman standing in dead grass in rain. The shape that did not require explanation because the shape was the explanation.

His core was broken. Nascent Soul, once — broken by hubris. Different mechanism. Different cause. Same result.

*You never asked what happened. That was the first thing about you I could stand.*

He stood there. At fifty paces. Offering nothing — no words, no comfort, no gesture. He had nothing to offer. Offering required having. Having required wholeness. Neither of us possessed it.

The minutes passed, the rain drizzling, his coat wet, his hands trembling.

Then he turned slowly — the way someone turned when turning required reassembling the intention to move. He turned and he walked. Away. His gait uneven — a body compensating for a broken core. The limp that was not a limp but close enough.

He did not look back. Not because he didn't want to. Because looking back was the gesture of people leaving something they could return to. He had not arrived. Arriving required an invitation. The host was standing in dead grass and the host was not hosting.

Fifty paces.

The distance of two broken things that recognized each other. The closest thing to comfort. Insufficient.
