At the edge. Fifty paces.

A signature. Broken. The frequency of a core shattered by something other than death â€” forced disruption that produced a signature like a bell hit wrong, audible in the overtones.

Xu Ran.

Standing. In his torn coat. At the edge of the clearing where I had stopped â€” the clearing a consequence of my stopping, the trees around it intact but the grass beneath me: brown, dead.

He saw me. I saw him. Peripheral. Unimportant. Another body in a world of bodies that either lived or didn't.

He felt the aura.

I could see it â€” the physical response. His face going pale, then green. Nausea. His hands: shaking. Not from cold. From the qi-emission hitting his already-broken system â€” additional stress on a structure with no tolerance for additional stress.

Blood. In his mouth. The capillary disruption. He spat â€” sideways, discreetly, the gesture of a man who maintained propriety even while his body rejected proximity.

He stayed.

Not moved forward. Not stepped closer. But stayed â€” at fifty paces, at the edge of the radius. Here. Present. Enduring. The trembling: continuous. The nausea: continuous. The blood-taste: continuous. He endured all of it by clenching his jaw and standing.

He looked at me.

I didn't look back. Not directly. His presence registered the way weather registered â€” atmospheric, environmental, a condition of the space rather than an occupant.

He understood something. Not the details â€” not the qi-mechanics, not the timeline. But the shape. The shape of loss visible in the shape of a woman standing in dead grass in rain. The shape that did not require explanation because the shape was the explanation.

His core was broken. Not by death â€” by hubris. Different mechanism. Different cause. Same result: broken.

Broken understood broken.

*You never asked what happened. That was the first thing about you I could stand.*

He stood there. At fifty paces. Offering nothing â€” no words, no comfort, no gesture. Because he had nothing to offer. Because offering required having and having required wholeness and wholeness was the thing neither of us possessed.

Minutes. The rain: drizzling. His coat: wet. His hands: trembling.

Then he turned. Slowly. The way someone turned when turning required reassembling the intention to move. He turned and he walked. Away. His gait uneven â€” a body compensating for a broken core. The limp that was not a limp but close enough.

He did not look back. Not because he didn't want to. Because looking back was the gesture of people leaving something they could return to. He had not arrived. Arriving required an invitation. The host was standing in dead grass and the host was not hosting.

Fifty paces.

The distance of two broken things that recognized each other. The closest thing to comfort. Insufficient.
