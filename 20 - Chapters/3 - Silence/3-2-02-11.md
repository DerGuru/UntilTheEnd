The sword stall.

Wei had found it the way he found everything — by gravitational pull, the magnetism of metal for a boy who had been training with blades since his hands were large enough to hold one. This stall had thirty of them.

I stood at the herb stall across the aisle. Close enough. The distance of supervision that pretended to be coincidence — three meters, line of sight, the kind of proximity that said: I'm shopping, and also: I can cross this distance in under a second if necessary.

He was examining a jian. Holding it wrong — deliberately, testing the balance from an unconventional grip. The vendor watched with the patience of someone who had seen many boys hold swords and a declining probability of sale.

"Good blade."

Not Wei. Behind him. A voice — young, warm, the temperature of friendliness that was too consistent to be spontaneous. Like a fire that had been set deliberately. Their deliberateness was invisible if you weren't looking for the match.

I looked.

A young man. Early twenties. Clean — the kind of clean that was a project, not an accident. His clothes were simple but fitted. His smile: present. Constant. Infrastructure, not expression.

"Too heavy for your frame, though," he continued. Conversational. Light.

Wei looked at him. The assessment was fast — Wei's assessments were always fast, the reflex of someone who had learned early that evaluation preceded interaction. Their evaluation was: nonthreatening, knowledgeable, interesting.

"I know," Wei said. "That's why I'm testing the off-balance point."

The young man's smile shifted — a millimeter. From standard to engaged. The micro-expression of someone whose interest had been piqued. Their piquing was genuine where his smile was not.

"You test off-balance points?"

"How else do you know where the sword fails?"

A pause. The young man studied Wei. Not his face — his posture. His feet. His hips. The inventory of someone who was reading a body the way a physician reads symptoms: systematically, professionally, with conclusions forming behind an expression that remained pleasant.

"I'm Shen Liang."

"Wei."

"Just Wei?"

"Just Wei."

Shen Liang picked up a blade from the display. Short, light — a dao. He demonstrated a grip — casual, but the casualness was performance. His technique was excellent. Foundation-level cultivation expressed through muscle memory, through the economy of motion that came from years of repetition under competent instruction.

"Iron Lotus," he said. "We're up the valley. You've heard of us?"

"Lao Chen mentions you sometimes."

"The old swordsmith? Good blades. Better conversation." A grin. Not the smile — a grin. The distinction between the two: the grin was warmer. Also calculated, but the calculation was better hidden.

"Are you a recruiter?" Wei asked. Direct. The directness I had tried to train out of him. He said what he meant.

Shen Liang laughed. The laugh of someone who had been caught doing what they were doing. Their catching was an opportunity rather than a problem.

"I'm a senior disciple. I notice talent. It's a hobby."

"That's recruitment."

"It's appreciation."

They talked. I listened from the herb stall, examining dried chrysanthemum with zero percent of my attention and one hundred percent of my perception trained on the conversation four meters away.

Shen Liang was good. Not good the way skill was good — good the way mirrors were good. He reflected Wei back at himself, amplified. Asked the right questions. Made Wei feel heard. The hearing was the technique.

"You train alone?" Shen Liang asked.

"Mostly."

"Who taught you?"

A pause. The choice of what to share with a stranger — the category that required caution. I’d taught him that.

"An acquaintance."

The word landed. Deliberately imprecise. Someone, not no one, but not the word that fit.

Shen Liang accepted it. No follow-up. The restraint of someone who recognized a boundary — and had patience.

"Your acquaintance taught you well."

"She's adequate."

I examined the chrysanthemum more closely. Adequate. Simultaneously high praise — because from Wei it was — and diminishment. The word you used for things you'd outgrown. Shen Liang heard the subtext.

They talked for thirty more minutes. Shen Liang being interested. Wei being fourteen and talking to someone who was not me.

I bought chrysanthemum. I didn't need chrysanthemum. I didn't drink chrysanthemum tea. I bought chrysanthemum because purchasing was the cover. Thirty minutes of pretending not to listen to a conversation that was about me without mentioning me.

Fine.
