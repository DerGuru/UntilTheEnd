It happened at the well.

Midday. Wei stood with Lao Chen's neighbor — a farmer whose name I knew but whose name was irrelevant because relevance had compressed to a single point and the point was the flicker.

They were talking. Normal. The ordinary conversation of a boy and a man at a well — water, weather, the quality of the recent harvest recovery. Wei was animated — the animation that was his default, the brightness of someone who was fourteen and had recently saved a settlement. Their saving was the credential and the credential was the confidence.

Then his core pulsed.

Not internally — externally. The visible, undeniable eruption of qi that broke through his dampening and expressed itself as a brief aura: golden, hot, radiating outward from his body in a pulse that was visible to anyone with eyes, not just cultivators, not just sensitives, anyone whose visual cortex processed light.

For one second, Wei looked like a lantern. A human-shaped light source. A boy who was broadcasting at a frequency that was visible in the mundane spectrum.

The farmer stepped back. Involuntary. The physical retreat of a body that had been startled by something it couldn't categorize — not fear, not aggression, just: what was that?

"Your qi — what IS that?"

Wei blinked. The blink of someone who had felt something and was deciding whether the something was real or imagined. His hands — he looked at them. Both. The tremor was there — bilateral, fine, the vibration that I had catalogued at Stage 2 and that was now visible to someone other than me in daylight at a well.

"Nothing. Just—"

"That wasn't 'nothing.'"

Wei looked at his hands. Closed them. Opened them. Closed them. The tremor persisted through the first close, diminished through the second, stopped.

"Just tired," he said.

The farmer looked at him. The looking that said: I don't believe you, but I don't have information to contradict you, and the absence of information is the space where I file this and the filing is: forgotten, until it happens again, and the again is—

Wei moved on. Toward the market stall.

I stayed at my position. Wall. Tea. The observation post that I had occupied for the entire morning and that provided the angle of: everything visible, nothing interfered with.

The flicker had been visible to at least four people. The farmer. A woman at the nearest stall. A child. Fang Liang.

Fang Liang.

He was there. Afternoon. At the settlement's edge — not the market, the periphery. Dressed differently: simpler clothes, a satchel of herbs, the presentation of a traveling merchant rather than a sect disciple. The disguise was competent. The disguise was also irrelevant because his qi-signature was the same and his qi-signature was catalogued and catalogued was permanent.

He was distributing salves and herbal remedies. Helping settlers. The performance of benevolence that was simultaneously genuine and strategic — he could do both, genuinely help and strategically position, and the both was the skill and the skill was what made him dangerous.

Wei recognized him. I watched the recognition cross Wei's face — the micro-expression of surprise that preceded the recalibration that preceded the decision and the decision was: approach.

They spoke. I was too far to hear the words. But I could read Wei's body — the posture of attention, the listening that Wei performed when someone was telling him something he didn't want to hear but couldn't dismiss.

Fang Liang handed Wei something. Small. A jar — healing salve, probably. For the shoulder. The kindness of a handler maintaining contact through care.

Then: a sentence. One. I read it on Fang Liang's lips because reading lips was a skill I possessed and rarely needed and now needed.

"You have to decide, boy. Soon no wall will be enough."

His face. The smile: gone. For the first time since I'd seen him, the infrastructure of friendliness was not operational. His expression was — naked. Not cold like the jade-tablet report. Not warm like the market encounter. Just: there. Present. Unmediated.

Worried? Maybe. Or pragmatic — the pragmatism of someone who was losing a resource. Their losing produced concern that looked like worry but was actually investment protection.

Or maybe he was a man in his twenties who had met a boy and recognized something in the boy and was now watching the boy walk toward a thing that was coming and the coming was the thing and the warning was the truth and the truth was unsmiling.

No wall will be enough.

Ambiguous. The walls of the settlement — against the sect. Or the walls of Wei's body — against his core. Both readings valid. Both true.

Wei stood. After Fang Liang left. In the afternoon light. Holding a jar of healing salve. Looking at the road that led east toward the sect gate and the sect gate being the door that he had closed and that was now being opened from the other side.

He didn't tell me about the conversation. That evening, at the table, with the rice and the tea: nothing.

"Long day," I said.

"Mm."

"Shoulder?"

"Fine."

The first thing Wei didn't share. The first information he kept.

The symmetry was perfect and terrible: I was keeping information from him. He was keeping information from me. We were sitting across a table from each other with our separate secrets and the table being the space between us and the space being the width of unsaid things.

I drank my tea. He drank his.

The table held.
