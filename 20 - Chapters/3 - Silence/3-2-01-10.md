It was market day.

The larger settlement was two hours east — bigger streets, actual buildings with second floors, the kind of infrastructure that said people had stayed long enough to invest in vertical expansion.

Wei walked ahead of me, three steps out, the distance that used to be one.

The stalls spread along the main road in the comfortable chaos of rural commerce. Spices — cinnamon and star anise and something pungent that smelled like ambition. Fabrics — silk and linen and the rough-weave cotton Wei had worn until three weeks ago, when he'd traded for a marginally less rough shirt. At the far end, the weapon sellers had laid out swords and polearms alongside farming tools that could become weapons with sufficient intention.

The crowd was loud and pressing and wonderfully normal — bodies in proximity, transactions as the organizing principle of human contact.

Wei haggled. He was really good at it — months of practice had turned instinct into technique. But the blade stone had caught his eye from six stalls away, and desire was the enemy of leverage. He negotiated the way someone negotiates when they've already decided to buy: going through the motions, cutting the price by ten percent when he could have managed thirty, accepting the number the moment it approached reasonable.

"You paid too much," I said.

"It's a good blade stone." He held it up, turning it in the light. "Feel the grain."

"I can see the grain from here. You still paid too much."

"Then next time you haggle."

I wouldn't. He knew I wouldn't. The exchange was a draw.

He tried fruit. Paid first, then tried. The order of operations that separated transaction from theft.

"These are good." He held up something round and green. "Want one?"

"No."

He bought two anyway. The generosity of someone who understood that "no" was sometimes just being polite and not a real answer.

A cart pushed through the aisle, too wide for the gap between stalls, driven by an old man who didn't care. Crates shifted. A stack of ceramic bowls on the nearest table wobbled, and the vendor lunged for them, swearing. One bowl escaped, hit the ground, and the crack was clean and final.

Wei caught the second one — reflexes fast, instinctive, fast enough to draw attention. He set the bowl down gently.

"Thanks," the vendor said, still swearing at the cart driver's retreating back.

Wei grinned at me, the grin of someone who had done something useful and wanted credit.

I gave him nothing. He didn't need it.

Then came the problem. His qi.

He dampened it — he knew how, had known for months, the technique I'd shown him that compressed his signature into something that didn't broadcast to every qi-sensitive being within two lis. But dampening required concentration, and concentration was competing with the sword vendor who had a blade with a wave pattern, and the herb stall where he recognized lemongrass and pointed it out as though I hadn't identified it from twelve meters, and the old woman selling dumplings whose steam was a sensory event, and the boy his age, maybe younger, demonstrating a basic form with a practice sword and doing it wrong in ways that Wei catalogued and almost corrected. The almost-correction was visible in the twitch of his hands.

He forgot. Not all at once — gradually. The dampening thinned, and his qi expanded like a candle whose shade has been lifted. A slow, warm brightening that was invisible to normal perception and absolutely visible to anyone with cultivation.

A woman — middle-aged, around forty. Sect robes with silver thread at the collar — Iron Lotus or adjacent. Inner Disciple level, maybe higher stood at the weapon stall. My neck tightened before I even turned. Her eyes shifted to Wei the way a compass needle shifts to north: automatically, with the precision of something responding to a force rather than a choice. She looked, calculated, and looked away.

There was a man at the fabric stall, young possibly 25, his cultivation concealed but present. Foundation stage, the kind of practitioner who moved through markets as surveillance rather than shopping. He had no obvious marks of any affiliation. His attention snagged on Wei like cloth on a nail, held, and released with a deliberateness that said: I've noted this.

Wei was at the spice stall, when a he brushed past him — close, closer than the crowd required. His shoulder clipped Wei's arm and Wei stepped sideways, not afraid, just surprised, but the man kept walking without turning. Foundation stage. The brush had been intentional, a proximity read, checking Wei's qi the way you'd test a melon by pressing it.

I memorized his face, his gait and the scar on his left hand.

The last presence was harder to place — at the periphery, not visible but present. Professional attention.

Three qi-sensitive beings who had noticed my boy between the sword stall and the dumpling vendor.

"The dumplings here are terrible," Wei announced, mouth full.

"Then why are you eating your fourth?"

"Terrible doesn't mean bad. It means they could be better." He chewed thoughtfully. "Different category."

"That is not what terrible means."

He ate a fifth and moved on. Oblivious to the people around him. He could identify a quality blade at ten paces but not a surveillance operative at two. Priorities.

Wei walked through the stalls and a spice vendor stepped back as he passed. A small step. Involuntary. The physical retreat of a body responding to a presence that was too bright for casual proximity.

Wei didn't notice.

I did.

"Can we come back next week?" he asked, holding two bags — herbs, a blade-polishing stone and something wrapped in paper that he wouldn't show me.

"Maybe."

"That means yes."

It didn't. But he was right that my maybes had been trending toward yes.

We walked home with him three steps ahead. The fruit — both of them — in my hand, because he'd put them there when I wasn't paying attention. My not-paying-attention was a lie. His putting was care, and care was the thing he did now that he didn't need to receive it anymore.
