Morning — wrong.

I woke to the weight of it. Not physical weight — qi-weight. The heaviness of qi-flows shifting in the region.

Like a storm that wouldn't arrive. The barometric promise of violence existing as pressure rather than precipitation — atmosphere holding its breath.

Wei felt it too. He sat up slowly. Not the usual explosion of waking — the tentative rise of someone whose body was registering environmental data before consciousness had time to sort it.

"It feels heavy," he said.

He was right. It did.

Outside: the settlement was already wrong. The wrongness of a place where things had changed overnight and the change was visible in the mundane — the fields, the animals, the plants. The domestic infrastructure of a community that depended on stability encountering the instability that qi-shifts produced.

The fields. Three of them — the barley, the root vegetables, the grain that Auntie Huang called "the good one." Brown. Wilted overnight, the cellular collapse of crops whose qi-nourished soil had been disrupted. Plants spoke disruption in their own vocabulary: droop, brown, fall.

Wei's garden. I checked it before he did — standing in the doorway, looking at the three pots.

The dock grass: wilting. The vertical confidence of yesterday replaced by the lateral surrender of today, the stems bending toward the earth with the posture of plants that were giving up. The nettle-cousin: worse. Its ambiguous bloom — the small, white, wrong flower — closed. Sealed. The botanical equivalent of retreat.

The lemongrass: holding. Barely. The accidental rightness of this plant proving marginally more resilient than the deliberate wrongness of the others, the irony being that the one thing he'd planted correctly was the one thing that survived longest.

Animals. Dogs barking — the sustained, directionless barking of something wrong. Lao Chen's cat: gone. Three chickens from Auntie Huang's coop: huddled, quiet. Birds that should have been loud. Their silence was louder than their noise ever was. Lao Chen's cat, in fairness, vanished on a biweekly basis for reasons that predated qi-disruption and likely involved the fish stall two settlements over. I excluded it from the data.

People. Headaches. Nausea. The physical symptoms of qi-pressure on uncultivated bodies. They felt the shift as discomfort, as malaise, as something hostile they couldn't name.

Auntie Huang: out early. Loud, but not the usual loud — higher-pitched, edged with fear.

"Something's wrong with the water," she announced to no one. To everyone. "It tastes like metal."

Her methods lacked refinement. Her conclusions did not.

It did. I'd tasted it. The ferric quality of water whose mineral content had been altered by qi-flow disruption — shifts deep enough to reach the aquifer, the aquifer expressing the disturbance as iron, iron tasting like blood.

The qi-flows themselves. I felt them — extended my perception outward, traced the energy patterns that ran beneath the settlement and the valley and the region. They were moving. Not the normal, tidal movements that qi-flows made in response to season and moon and the ambient physics of cultivation environments. These were disruptions. Structural. The qi equivalent of a river changing course — the underground energy streams that had been stable for decades now rerouting, compressing in some areas and depleting in others.

The source: northeast. The qi-node that fed the valley — a concentration point where energy streams converged and distributed and that served as the circulatory system's heart for this corner of the world. It was destabilizing. Not collapsing — shifting. Like a bowl being tilted, the contents sliding to one side, the balance lost.

I catalogued. Field damage: three sectors. Animal behavior: flight response in four out of seven domestic species. Human symptoms: twelve adults presenting with qi-pressure malaise. Core infrastructure: water quality compromised. Qi-flow disruption: northeast source, destabilizing.

Wei came outside. His qi-sensitivity detected the disruption, the wrongness in the ambient field. His face: serious. The grin replaced by context.

He knelt by his garden. Touched the dock grass. The wilting stem between his fingers.

"What's happening?" he asked.

"The qi-flows are shifting. The source northeast is destabilizing."

He looked at me. Then at the settlement. At the brown fields. At the dogs barking. At the people holding their heads.

He stood.

The standing that preceded decision. The posture of someone who was about to act.
