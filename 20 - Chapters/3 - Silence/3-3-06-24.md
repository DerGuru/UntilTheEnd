I healed his shoulder.

The process: routine. Qi applied to damaged tissue, encouraging what the body would do anyway — knit, seal, rebuild. My qi was old and efficient and his body was young and responsive. The healing was fast and clean and left a scar because scars were the only honest record of what had happened and honesty was not something I was willing to suppress.

He sat on a rock. Patient — adrenaline receding, exhaustion replacing the triumph.

The wound closed. The scar formed — a diagonal line from the top of his left shoulder to the crease of his elbow. Pale, thin.

He touched it. Ran his finger along the line.

"Scars are cool," he said.

"They're tissue damage."

"Cool tissue damage."

I finished. Stepped back. His shoulder: healed. His core: humming. The post-combat resonance of qi that had been deployed at maximum and was now resettling. Higher than before. The clock ticking.

His grin. Still there. Dimmer — exhaustion muted it — but persistent.

I watched him. Standing in the clearing. Fourteen. Blood-smeared. Scarred. Victorious. Grinning.

And I saw through him.

Another face. Before. A long time before.

A fighter. Young. Strong. Not Wei — different name, different face, different era, different everything except: this. The post-victory moment. The blood. The grin.

He won. Not against a qi-beast — against another cultivator. Higher level, more experienced. He shouldn't have won. He stood in the aftermath with the same expression Wei was wearing now — undefeatable certainty. His core had done the same thing — the post-combat surge, the brightness, the warmth he'd dismissed as exertion.

Three weeks. That's how long it took. From first victory to second fight. Three weeks of training harder, pushing further, riding the high.

He'd won the second fight too. Technically. The other fighter fell first. But the cost was the core. Running hot since the first victory, running beyond containment, until the cascade produced failure.

*He also won. Then—*
You would have seen it too. You always saw the pattern before I did.
I stopped. The memory. Mid-image.

Wei stretched. Flexed his healed shoulder. Grinned at me.

"Ready to go?" he asked.

I looked at him. Not through him — at him. The discipline of present-tense looking. The boy who was here instead of the boy who was not here.

"Ready," I said.

We walked. Through the forest. Past the stream. Toward the settlement. Him ahead — three steps, four steps, the distance growing as his energy returned and the victory solidified from experience into narrative.

Behind him: me. With someone else's grin. Someone else's three weeks.

*Wei is different. Wei is stubborn. Wei survives.*

*He has to be different.*
