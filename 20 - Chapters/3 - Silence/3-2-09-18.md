Night.

Wei slept. The predictable depth of a boy whose days were full enough to produce exhaustion. The exhaustion was permission: rest, deep, total, the surrender that only safety allowed.

His core.

I felt it from the doorway. Before I crossed the room. Before I knelt. Two weeks ago, I'd felt it from a meter. A week ago, from two. Tonight: from the doorway. Four meters.

The range was expanding.

I crossed. Knelt. The nightly arrangement — my knees on the floor beside his bed, my hand hovering, the two-centimeter gap between contact and assessment.

Light. Through his shirt. Golden, warm, steady — the candle-behind-paper quality that was beautiful and was also the indicator of output exceeding containment and the containment being a body and the body being fourteen and fourteen being insufficient and insufficient being the trend.

Four twitches per minute.

I counted. The count was automatic. Four contractions of qi-stability. Four moments where his core stuttered, flickered, reset. Four interruptions in what should have been smooth emission — indicating strain, indicating fatigue, indicating a progression.

Four. Yesterday: three. The day before: three. Two weeks ago: two.

The arithmetic. Two, two, two, three, three, three, three, four. The slope. Positive. Slow. Consistent. The kind of consistent that said: this is not random, this is progression, and progression has an endpoint.

I withdrew my hand.

"Your qi is loud," I said. To him. To the room. To no one.

He stirred. "Mmh."

"Turn over."

He turned, mumbling something about radishes. The glow dimmed slightly — side-sleeping compressed the broadcast, changed the angle. A half-measure. Like holding a candle sideways.

I went outside. The door — quiet, careful.

Night air. Cool. The settlement sleeping — dark houses, dark paths, the occasional ember-glow of a fire banked for morning. Somewhere: a dog. Somewhere: a stream.

The qi-field.

I extended my perception. A hundred meters. Enough to feel the settlement's perimeter. Lao Chen, asleep, his qi like old iron — dull, stable, the resonance of someone who had peaked decades ago and settled into peace. Frau Huang: bright, loud even in sleep. Shen: dim, muted.

I stopped.

The field. Beyond the settlement. Something.

Something subtler. The qi-equivalent of being watched — a shift in ambient pressure when attention was directed at a location. This settlement. The boy it contained.

Weeks ago — at the market — the attention had been directional. Three cultivators, three lines of interest converging on Wei. Navigation. Triangulation.

This was different. This was ambient. The field itself altered by the looking, the way a lake's surface changes not because something touched it but because something is watching it. The watching had weight.

Not me. I checked — the habit of millennia. My presence was suppressed, compressed, the signature of void. No. Not me.

Him.

The attention was on the boy. On the golden light broadcasting through cotton. On the signal that he was and that I could not stop him from being.

Before: I hid. They sought me. I moved. They lost me. Simple.

But if they sought him, then hiding was his problem. And his skill was: none. He had qi that screamed. He had a core that glowed through fabric.

I could hide myself. I could not hide him. Not without permanent suppression — and permanent suppression would stunt his growth and damage was unacceptable.

I went back inside.

Stood over him. Sleeping. The glow softer now, the core cycling down. But still visible. Still broadcasting.

Four twitches.

I knelt. Pulled his blanket higher. The gesture — the same gesture, every night.

"You're still there," he murmured. Half-asleep. Not a question.

"Yes."

"Good."

He was gone again. Into sleep. Into the depth that was trust made horizontal.

Tomorrow he would wake. Would stretch, yawn, run to Lao Chen's. Would be bright. Would broadcast.

And I would sit. And count. And not tell him.

Because not telling him was the thing I could not stop doing. And could not start. And the space between the two was where I lived now.

The space between.
