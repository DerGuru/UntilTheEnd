They were still at the sword stall — Wei and Fang Liang, thirty minutes deep into the kind of conversation that boys had with mentors who weren't their mentors, and the not-mentoring looked like equality, and equality was seductive when you were fourteen.

Wei shifted and demonstrated something — a stance, the opening position of a form. He moved into it the way he moved into everything: efficiently, without preamble.

And Fang Liang said it.

Casual. Almost offhand. As though it had just occurred to him, which it hadn't, because nothing that Fang Liang said just occurred to him.

"You correct your hip on the transition step. Almost no one does that without a teacher."

Wei stopped.

I watched from the herb stall, chrysanthemum in my hand. My hand was steady. My chest was not.

The hip correction — the subtle, nearly invisible adjustment that Wei made when transitioning between the third and fourth positions, the micro-rotation of the pelvis that aligned the strike vector with the spine. I had never explicitly taught him. My teaching method was demonstration, and his learning method was observation, and the observation had produced this: a correction so subtle that I hadn't been sure he'd absorbed it until three months ago, when I'd seen it and hadn't mentioned it. Mentioning it would have made it conscious, and conscious would have made it fragile.

Fang Liang had seen it too. He had identified a nuance that existed in the space between instruction and absorption, and he had named it.

That was what it was. Being named. Having something yours — a thing your body did that you didn't know it did — identified by a stranger. Recognition. The need that every fourteen-year-old carried and that most received from parents and peers. Wei received his from me. And mine was the only recognition, both sufficient and insufficient. And here, at the sword stall, a stranger showed him my insufficiency.

"I—" Wei started. Stopped. Started again. "I didn't know I did that."

"It's instinct? You've got a good one." Fang Liang's smile was warm now — genuinely, or a simulation indistinguishable from the real thing. "Whoever taught you — your acquaintance — they move well. And you learned how they move."

"Yeah." Quiet. Processing something large in a space too small.

"Your talent is wasted here." Fang Liang said it simply, without pressure — the absence of pressure that was itself a form of pressure, truth stated calmly being more persuasive than truth stated urgently. "The Iron Lotus has masters who specialize in blade forms. Precision work. The kind of thing that turns instinct into technique."

"I'm not—" Wei hesitated. About to decline. Couldn't quite get the decline to leave his mouth because his mouth was still processing the recognition and the recognition was still warm.

"Think about it." Fang Liang stepped back — easy, offering space, which was the thing that pressureless selling provided. "I'm at the sect gate most mornings. If you want to see the training grounds."

He left cleanly, no lingering — the departure of someone who understood that the best hook was the one you let the fish approach.

Wei stood alone at the sword stall. The vendor returned to his blades.

I set down the chrysanthemum. Crossed the aisle. Stood beside him.

He looked at me. The face of someone who had just been seen by a new pair of eyes and was still absorbing the shape of it.

"Ready to go?" I asked.

"Yeah." A beat. "He was — nice."

"Was he?"

"You don't think so?"

"I didn't talk to him."

"You were listening."

True.

We walked home. Wei three steps ahead. The chrysanthemum — purchased, unnecessary, unwanted — in my bag.

On the path, Wei demonstrated the transition step. Third to fourth position. The hip correction — there, visible, perfect.

"Look," he said. "I do correct my hip."

I looked.

"You always have," I said.

He grinned. The grin that said: someone noticed. The grin that didn't say — but that I heard: someone else noticed first.

The path home was two hours, and neither of us spoke for the first thirty minutes. The silence was the space where things settled — his discovery, my inventory, his excitement, my count. Three cultivators. One recruiter. One hip correction.

One boy, broadcasting his qi-signature.
