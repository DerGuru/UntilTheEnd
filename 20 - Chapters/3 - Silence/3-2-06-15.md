Two days passed. Wei didn't mention the Iron Lotus. Didn't mention Fang Liang. Trained, cooked, went to Lao Chen's, came back with metal dust in his hair and questions about tempering techniques that I answered with the minimum required.

On the third day, he mentioned it.

He came in from training. Stood in the kitchen — the posture of someone assembling a speech, visible in the set of his shoulders and his hands hanging useless at his sides.

"I've been thinking about it."

I knew what it was. It was the only it in the room.

"About the sect."

I put down my tea. Not because I needed to — but putting it down was giving him my attention, and asking was rare, and rare deserved the cup on the table.

"I want to know what you think," he said.

The same request as two days ago. Re-presented. Because the first response — the seventh-form correction, the deflection — had been audible as a deflection. He was fourteen. Old enough to hear deflection. Young enough to insist on trying again.

I looked at him. Brown eyes. Morning light.

"If you want to go," I said, "go."

Five words. Five syllables containing enough emotional material to sustain a lesser being for weeks, delivered with the flatness that was my register and that was necessary because the alternative was the tremor.

He looked at me.

"That's not advice."

"No."

"What is it?"

I paused. The genuine pause — not theatrical, not strategic. Someone searching for the honest answer and discovering the honest answer had contradictory layers.

"Respect."

He blinked.

"Respect?"

"For your judgment. You're fourteen. You've survived more than most adults. You're capable of making this decision."

He studied me. Parsing the response for subtext and finding more of it than he'd expected.

"You don't want me to go."

Statement. Not question.

I said nothing.

"But you're not going to say that," he continued.

"No."

"Because it would be — what? Controlling?"

He understood. Better than I'd expected. She won't tell me what to do because telling me what to do is the thing she's most afraid of.

Not the most afraid of. The most afraid of was him dying. But the second most was him living as someone whose life was her construction.

"It would be unfair," I said.

"To whom?"

"To you."

He stood there. Kitchen. Morning light. The gouge in the table. The chrysanthemum — still in its paper bag, still unused.

"Okay," he said.

"Okay."

He went outside. Back to training. The forms, the transitions, the hip correction that was his and that Fang Liang had named and that I had taught without naming because not-naming was my method.

I sat. Kitchen. Tea — cold.

The word I'd used: respect.

The word I meant: fear.

But fear and respect lived in the same house.

I drank my tea.
