I stood up. At some point. The point was unmarked — no decision, no impulse, no trigger. The body stood because lying was not sustainable.

The door. Outside. The bowl — cold now, the steam gone, the rice hardened at the surface. I stepped over it. The trajectory of someone who did not see the bowl because the bowl was irrelevant. Movement. Any direction. Away.

Past the garden.

His garden. The three pots. My peripheral vision registered them — there, present, green — and peripheral was all I permitted. Direct was not an option.

I walked.

Through the settlement. Damaged walls on both sides. People — settlers, civilians, survivors — in their doorways, at their windows, in the positions of people watching something that should not be watched but that could not be avoided because the something was walking down their street.

They moved away.

The small, instinctive adjustments bodies made in proximity to something wrong — stepping back, pulling children closer, turning sideways. The universal vocabulary of avoidance that didn't require language or understanding. Only proximity.

Under my feet: the grass. Brown. Three paces — the radius, smaller now than the thirty paces of the discharge aftermath but present, persistent. Each step: brown behind it. Green in front. The trail of someone whose trail was death.

An insect: fell. Mid-flight. In my radius. Wings still. On the dirt.

Leaves: curling at the edges. On the trees I passed, on the bushes, on the vegetation lining the path out. The slow wilting that heat produced in summer and that I was producing in not-summer.

Past the east gate. Past the open ground. Past the place.

I did not look at the place. The dirt where he had lain. The spot that was marked by — what? Blood, qi-residue, the chemical evidence of a body that had discharged and fallen and lain and been. Whatever marked it. I did not look.

Into the forest. The trees — large, old, the kind of trees that had been growing before this settlement existed and that would continue growing after this settlement forgot itself. Their age was their resistance. Older biology: harder to kill. The grass died in my wake but the trees merely weakened — leaves losing rigidity, bark drying slightly, the subtle symptoms of exposure that would heal when the exposure left.

I walked. No direction. No purpose. The body moved because the alternative was the house, and the house was the bowl, and the bowl was the empty room.

Away from people. Away from the settlement. Away from the barriers I had built and the signs I had carved and the walls that held. The walls holding was the proof. The proof was the thing I could not stand — because it said: you protected everything. And everything was a lie. Everything excluded him.

His mother, his brother, his sister — somewhere in a village with a cracked well and dry fields, they would learn. Or they wouldn't, and the absence itself would become the message.

The forest closed behind me. The green — and then the brown path that I left. The trail of dead grass and curled leaves that said: someone came this way. And the someone was the thing that killed what she walked through.

I walked.
