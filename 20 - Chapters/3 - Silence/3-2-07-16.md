He left before sunrise.

Not sneaking — Wei couldn't sneak if his survival depended on it, and his survival had depended on it, and he hadn't sneaked then either. He simply woke early and dressed and stood in the doorway and said:

"I'm going to look."

"I know."

"Just look."

"Yes."

He left. His footsteps went barefoot on stone, then dirt, then the path east, then gone — the progressive silence of departure, distance accumulating between us.

I sat.

I am not good at waiting. I am good at action — assessment, intervention, response. Built for the sprint, not the vigil. For the correction, not the pause. And sitting was what I did.

The house was small and quiet, containing me and the absence of him, and the absence had weight. It pressed against the walls.

I made tea. Properly — hot water, leaves, the process that required attention and that I used as somewhere to put the focusing that needed to go somewhere because its destination was empty and empty was the house. I drank it hot, and the novelty was startling — the warmth of the cup as substitute for the warmth of the boy, and the substitution being inadequate.

I don't know how many hours. Time moved at the rate that waiting imposed — slow, thick with anxiety.

The items I did not do: train, repair, walk, cook, read, meditate, plan. The item I did: sit.

The teacup had a hairline crack running from the rim to the midpoint — not structural, not dangerous, the kind of flaw that reduced value without reducing function. I held the crack, my thumb over the line where the ceramic had compromised. Contained.

I released the crack. The cup held.

The afternoon sun moved from east windows to west. Four hours, five, six.

The garden through the window — the dock grass had produced a second stalk, vertical and determined. The lemongrass being lemongrass. The nettle-cousin had bloomed, a small white incorrect flower that was beautiful because it was wrong.

The blade fragment caught the afternoon light. His things — objects that said: I was here, I put these here, this is my place.

I waited. He would come back. He always came back, and always was the track record, and the track record was reliable.

Or he wouldn't. He would stay. He would walk through the gate and see things that were shiny and people who were impressed and the brightness would be reflected and the reflection would be irresistible.

The crack in the cup. I hadn't put my thumb back.

The light turned low and golden by evening, the honey-shade that preceded sunset. Then footsteps on the path, approaching — the rhythm of feet on dirt that I recognized because I recognized his, the cadence that was Wei and Wei was arriving.

He stood in the doorway, dirty shoes — he'd worn shoes, which meant formality, which meant he'd taken the visit seriously. His face was neutral.

"I'm staying."

Two words. The two best words. I went, I saw, I chose, and my choosing is here.

I said nothing. The exhale that didn't exhale. The relief that expressed itself as continued sitting and continued tea.

"Why?" I asked. Later. After. When he'd sat and poured tea and the arrival had settled into presence.

The grin. The authentic grin of someone who had found something funny in the serious.

"Because they were boring."

I looked at him. He looked at me.

The crack in the cup. Still holding.

"Boring," I repeated.

"Boring."

Because the Iron Lotus training grounds were impressive but not interesting, and impressive and interesting were different things, and his judgment lived in the difference.

Or: because the people there didn't see him. They saw his qi, his potential, his metrics. They saw a resource. And he — fourteen, someone who recognized the difference between being seen and being measured — had noticed.

Or: because back was here. Because here was me. He wasn't saying that. The not-saying was the answer. The answer was the grin.

"Have some tea," I said.

He drank.

The cup held.
