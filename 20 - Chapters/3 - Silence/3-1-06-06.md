He executed the technique perfectly.

No correction needed. No adjustment. He performed the seventh-form integrative sequence â€” the most complex pattern I'd taught him, the one that required simultaneous qi-circulation through three meridian sets while maintaining physical precision through twelve transitional postures â€” and he performed it without error.

Not just without error. With grace. The kind of movement that transcended technique and became expression. He was doing something I had seen thousands of times across four thousand years and that still produced in me the combination of pride and vertigo that accompanied watching someone finish becoming what you'd helped them become.

He was ready.

The thought arrived not as conclusion but as recognition. A few months more. Maybe a year. And he would have nothing left to learn from me that he couldn't learn faster from experience.

The trigger was mechanical. An association. Not a decision to remember but a collision between present perception and stored memory, the way a smell triggers a room you haven't entered in decades.

He was ready. The way someone else had been ready. Once.

A man. I don't remember his face â€” not accurately. Time had averaged it, merged it with others. But his hands: those I remembered. Large. Calloused from holding a sword and a brush and a child with equal frequency.

He was the last of a long line. Not the best-born â€” the best-made. Diligence was his instrument.

"I don't need you anymore." He said it with a smile. Not ungrateful â€” honest.

I was relieved. The bone-deep relief of someone who had been carrying a responsibility and was now allowed to set it down. He was ready. He didn't need me. I could go.

I went.

Three months. Three months and the kingdom he'd built was ash. Not from war. From overreach. He'd used what I taught him â€” correctly, with precision â€” and the competence had killed him because competence without limitation was demolition. And I had taught him the competence and I had not taught him the limitation.

"He got everything he needed," I said. Out loud. To no one. To the air and the fence and the cold tea. "Everything, exceptâ€”"

I didn't finish. Still. After millennia.

You would have finished the sentence. You always did.

Wei stopped. Wiped sweat. Grinned.

"Was that good?"

"Acceptable."

He WAS different. He was stubborn where the other had been precise. He was defiant where the other had been methodical. He adapted where the other had optimized. He survived through stubbornness and the universe's apparent inability to kill things that refused to acknowledge the attempt.

He was different.

He had to be different.

Because if he wasn'tâ€”

I drank my tea. Cold. The garden was golden in the late light. The dock grass was thriving. The lemongrass was lemongrass. The blade fragment caught the sun and threw a line of reflected light across the yard, a small bright stripe on the packed earth, temporary, beautiful.

Wei trained on. I watched.

Different.

Please.
