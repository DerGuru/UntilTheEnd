The first exchange.

Paw — lateral, fast, the sweeping strike of a forelimb that weighed more than Wei's torso and moved with the velocity of qi-enhanced muscle.

Wei dodged. Mostly. His body moved left — trained reflex, the instinct-muscle-nerve composite I had built into him through months of demonstration. His feet found the ground. His center held.

Almost.

The claw caught his sleeve. Fabric tore — a clean line from shoulder to elbow. No blood. Close enough to feel the air of the passing strike.

The lynx didn't pause. The second attack came as continuation, not sequence — hindquarters compressed, launched, the animal's full weight aimed at Wei's chest.

Wei rolled. Shoulder, spine, hip, feet, up. The combat roll he'd practiced two hundred times, executed without thought. Three meters. The lynx landed where he'd been. Claws found earth instead of boy. Dirt flew.

Wei stood. Qi in his hands. Bright.

The lynx turned. Fast — impossibly fast for something that large, a pivot that ignored what mass should have required.

It came again.

This time Wei didn't dodge. He met it. The decision that separated defense from combat — the moment a fighter chose to occupy the space where the attack was arriving rather than the space where it wasn't.

His qi-hands caught the lynx's momentum. Not fully — you didn't fully catch seventy kilos of qi-enhanced predator, not when you were fourteen and still learning the difference between confidence and capability. But enough. Enough to deflect.

The lynx slid past. Its flank scraped Wei's shoulder. Brief, hot.

Wei spun. Followed with a qi-strike — palm-forward, raw energy in a directed pulse. Connected. The lynx skidded. Recovered. Shook its head.

Not hurt. Annoyed. He'd hit it, and it was still here.

The lynx circled. Now. After two exchanges, after discovering this small loud creature was not easy — now it circled.

Wei breathed. Hard. Lungs at combat rate, face red, chest heaving. But his eyes: clear. Focused. Present in the present.

I stood at the edge. Eight meters.

My hands: fists. The discovery — unbidden, unwelcome — that my hands had closed without my permission. Fingers curled into palms. Nails pressing crescents into skin. Restraint made muscular.

The principle: he could do this. He was trained. He was capable. If I intervened now — unmade the lynx with a fraction of my capacity — I would solve this fight and solve him into dependence.

But.

The taste in my mouth. Iron. I'd bitten the inside of my cheek without deciding to. The body's version of the mind's restraint.

Blood. On my tongue. On my palms from nail crescents. Eight meters of distance that felt like a continent.

The lynx charged.
