It was morning.

I went back.

Not to the house. Not to the room that contained absence. To the garden. His. The three pots at the edge of the path, the blade fragment, the two grey stones. The collection he had assembled because assembling was his method: here is a garden, it has things in it, the things are mine.

Two of the pots were dead.

The dock grass had turned brown and dried, the stems collapsed inward — a plant that had lost its water source because no one had watered it for the days between the battle and now.

The nettle-cousin was the same — brown, curled, the leaves fallen from stems that were stalks that were sticks that were dead.

Two wrong herbs, chosen by a child who knew nothing about herbs. The charm of knowing nothing was irrelevant now. The relevance died with the watering.

The third pot.

The lemongrass — right by accident, the one he'd chosen without knowing what he was choosing, the herb that worked because it had root structure, biological investment in substrate that the other two lacked.

Alive.

Green in the morning grey, green among the brown circle of my proximity and the dead pots and the general browning of everything within three paces — growing, the stems upright, the leaves extended, alive because the plant had roots and the roots were deep.

Not my protection. Not qi. Not anything I had done or could do or would do. Biology. The simple, mechanical, non-magical fact that roots in soil plus depth plus time produced resilience. The resilience was here, in a clay pot pressed by dead hands.

I picked it up.

The pot. Heavier than expected — wet earth, clay, root mass. The weight of a small thing that contained a smaller thing that was alive by the mechanism of its own rootedness.

My fingertips were numb — the qi-emission had turned inward as well as outward, feedback from sustained uncontrolled emission, the emitter's own extremities losing sensitivity. The things I touched were barely felt. The pot was present in my hands by pressure, not by texture.

Earth crumbled at the rim — dry at the edge, wet at the center. A pot watered days ago, sufficient for the roots but not for the surface. Earth fell onto the dirt in small amounts, brown on brown.

I held it.

The pot sat in my hands with the lemongrass extending upward from the soil — green in the grey, alive in the dead.

I didn't know why I was holding it. The reason was not available. The thing that moved my hands to the pot was not a decision but a reflex — the same kind of reflex Wei had when he heard moaning. The involuntary orientation toward the thing that was alive in the space where alive was rare.

I held it. And it didn't die.

In my hands. In the three-pace radius that killed grass and dropped insects and weakened trees and nauseated people. The pot: alive. The herb: green. The roots: holding.

Not because of me. Not by my protection or my will or my ancient, useless, self-healing architecture that healed scratches and didn't heal sons. Because of roots. The plant had invested in depth. The depth produced resilience. The resilience was what I was holding.

---

I sat somewhere at the edge — of the settlement, of the forest, of the space between the place where people were and the place where I was. The boundary, the margin.

The pot stood beside me, upright, the lemongrass extending green.

Everything around me was dying — the grass brown, the leaves curled, the three-pace radius operational and persistent, the grief-field that continued because grief continued because continuing was its nature.

The pot was alive.

Because it had roots. And roots held. And holding was the difference between the two dead herbs and the one that wasn't.

*What has roots dies slower.*

Not a sentence with an origin. Not a quote, not a wisdom, not a teaching from any master in any century. A fact. Observed. The truth that required no frame because the frame was: the pot is alive and the grass is dead and the difference is roots.

What has roots dies slower.

I sat with the pot. In the margin. In the grey morning that was grey the way mornings were grey when the person who made mornings bright was not in them.

The settlement behind me was damaged but standing, the people in it alive and cautious, maintaining the distance my radius required.

The forest ahead was green, weakened at the edges by my proximity but green beyond, and the world continued.

Between them — me, sitting with a pot that did not wilt.

No sound. No wind. No voice, no argument, no complaint about the herbs, no declaration about cultivation, no stubbornness embodied in a fourteen-year-old body that moved through the world as if the world owed him an explanation and the explanation was overdue.

Silence.


The pot's green.

The nothing that remained. And the roots that held.
