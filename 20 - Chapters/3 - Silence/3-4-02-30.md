The well was the settlement's gathering point, the only structure that belonged to everyone. And water brought them together now, standing in a circle around the stone rim with the metal taste in their mouths and headaches in their temples and the dogs still barking.

The elder, sixty-three, weathered, the kind of authority that came from having been here longest and having survived longest, stood at the well's edge and said the thing no one else was willing to say.

"The qi is — wrong? Can anyone—?"

He stopped. Because he didn't know how to finish. The vocabulary of qi-crisis was not in his inventory — that was: rain, drought, blight, the ordinary agricultural catastrophes that had ordinary agricultural solutions. This was not ordinary. This was the earth itself being sick in a language he didn't speak.

The looks went to Wei.

They skipped me, skipped Lao Chen, whose metal-working tangentially involved qi but tangential wasn't competence, skipped Healer Mao, who was present but whose expertise was bones and fevers, not qi-flows and geological destabilization.

To Wei.

Because Wei was the cultivator. The only cultivator, so far as they knew. The one who trained in the clearing and fought rock lynxes and carried wounded woodcutters. This boy can do things. This boy understands the language the earth is speaking. This boy is fourteen, has scars and glowing hands.

Wei felt the looks. I watched him feel them. The arrival of collective attention, pairs of eyes carrying the same expectation.

Help us. Please.

He stood straighter. A posture that said, that he was  there, he heard them and he would respond.

"The qi source is northeast," he said. "At the mountain slope. It's shifted, but if we can stabilize it—"

He stopped and organized his thoughts. "we might be able to reverse it."

He separated them into four groups. The, natural, unbidden organization that came from someone who didn't know he was organizing because organizing was a function rather than a decision. He assigned them with the clarity that martial training produced, the decisiveness that came from forms and practice and the understanding that in crisis, hesitation was the enemy.

"First group: find the source. I'll lead. Anyone who can carry supplies."

"Second: secure the fields. Move what you can. The grain first; it's the most vulnerable."

"Third: anyone with medical knowledge, go to the sick. Water and shade for the headaches. Mao, can you?"

Healer Mao nodded. Already moving.

"Fourth: barriers. Dig channels around the north-facing structures. If the soil shifts further—"

He was right. About all of it. The sequence, the priorities, the distribution of labor — he had assessed the situation, identified the resources, allocated them. Not perfectly; there were inefficiencies that I could see and that he couldn't, because he was fourteen years and I was considerably older. But the inefficiencies were minor. The structure was sound.

Auntie Huang stood at the edge of the circle. Her son beside her, for once close, the unusual proximity of a boy who was usually gone by dawn being present at his mother's side because the wrongness of the morning had penetrated even his twelve-year-old imperviousness.

"The boy knows what he's doing," she said. To no one. To everyone. The Auntie Huang broadcast, delivered at the volume that ensured universal reception.

I stood apart with cold tea in my hand, outside the circle, outside the organization, watching Wei in the center — surrounded by adults who were listening to him. Fourteen, clearer than anyone in the circle, more certain than more experienced. Certainty was the compass.

A brief warmth — rare, measured in fractions of seconds. The involuntary response of someone who had built something and was watching it perform. The teaching worked.

And then came another unbidden realization.

He didn't need me. Not here. Not now. Not anymore. Not in this circle where he was organizing and delegating and being exactly what the settlement required. Sufficient.

That was the goal. Had always been the goal. But it stung anyway.

He was. Functioning. Without me.

And the proof was the absence.
