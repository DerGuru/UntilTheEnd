On the path back, the woodcutter.

A sound from the undergrowth â€” not the anti-sound of a predator, the opposite. Human sound. Pain that was too exhausted for screaming and had settled into sustained distress. A moan. Continuous. Someone who had been hurting for long enough that the hurting had become background.

Wei stopped.

I watched the stopping. His body arrested mid-stride, his head turning toward the sound with total immediacy. Automatic. The response of someone whose wiring connected the-sound-of-pain to the-action-of-response without intermediary.

This was him. Not my training. Not conditioning. The base layer, the thing that Wei was before Wei was anything else: someone who heard pain and moved toward it.

He was already running.

"Weiâ€”"

Gone. Into the undergrowth. No assessment, no pause, no calculation. Just: someone is hurt, I go.

I followed. Fast. Scanning for threats, feeling the qi-field for anomalies, performing the tactical assessment that he hadn't performed.

The woodcutter.

An older man. Fifties. His leg: pinned under a fallen tree â€” not large, but large enough. The trunk across his lower leg at an angle that said: broken. Probably.

His face: grey with pain. Sweat. Eyes: wide, desperate.

Wei was already at the tree.

"Hold still," he said. The command voice. Not learned â€” inherited. The authority of someone who had been in danger and come out the other side carrying confidence like a tool.

He channeled qi into his arms. Raw amplification â€” strength beyond muscle. He gripped the trunk. Lifted. The tree moved â€” not much, but enough. Enough for the leg to be free, the pressure to release.

The woodcutter groaned. Pain changing form â€” from the constant pressure of entrapment to the sharp acknowledgment of release. Better and worse simultaneously.

Wei pulled him free. Carefully â€” the care of someone who understood that movement was dangerous and was providing attention fully, totally.

"Your leg." He assessed. Not medical â€” field assessment. Branches for a splint, fabric torn from his own shirt for binding, the compression wrap I had shown him once. He executed it from memory with the accuracy of someone who learned by seeing once and doing forever.

He splinted the leg. Not perfectly â€” the angle was off, the binding tight in one place, loose in another. But functional. Sufficient.

Wei lifted the man. Supported him. Shoulder under arm â€” his right shoulder, because his left had a scar thirty minutes old, and the wince he didn't show was the cost he accepted without negotiation.

"Of course you help," he said. To nobody. To the forest. To the principle that existed in him beneath everything else: when someone is hurt, you help. It's not heroism. It's not choice. It's reflex.

They walked toward the settlement. Slowly. The woodcutter leaning on Wei. Wei: steady, patient, bearing weight that should have been too much for a body that had just fought a qi-beast and been clawed and been healed.

I followed. Behind.

*Of course you help.*

This boy could not not help. The double negative that was the positive. The grammar of compulsion: the option of not-helping was not in his vocabulary.

I watched him carry the woodcutter. Thought about the lynx. Thought about the grin. Thought about the warmth in his sternum and the two-second breath-stop and the word he'd used â€” tired â€” and the word I would have used â€” beginning.

The thing that made him beautiful was the thing that made him vulnerable.

And the thing that made him vulnerable was the thing that wouldâ€”

I didn't finish.

We walked home.
