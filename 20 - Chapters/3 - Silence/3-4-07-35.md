It was night, and the settlement slept the post-celebration sleep — deeper, heavier, the rest that followed relief and food and firelight. Earned and total.

Wei slept too, his face peaceful — the peace of someone who had saved twenty-seven people and stabilized a qi-source and been celebrated and was now processing all of it through unconsciousness.

I knelt beside him in the nightly arrangement — knees on the floor, hand hovering, the two-centimeter gap. The ritual that had become the architecture of my nights, producing data I filed, and the filing said: worse, getting worse, the progression continues.

A flicker — not the steady glow of his core at rest but an unsteady, visible, through-the-shirt flicker. The core not resting. Still resonating from today's output.

I counted.

Five.

Five twitches per minute.

Part one: three. Part two: four. Part three: four, irregular. Now: five. The numbers. The progression. Not a line — a curve. Upward. Accelerating. Each stage faster than the last. The intervals shortening.

I withdrew my hand.

His blanket — I pulled it higher, the care gesture automatic. The hands that had held the cave wall and the cold tea now performing the most basic act of care: covering a sleeping body against the cold that wasn't cold.

"Fixed it," Wei mumbled. Sleep-talking. The word surfacing from whatever dream he was in — victory, probably. The cave. The node. The doing.

"You did," I said. Quiet. He couldn't hear me.

"All of it." A mumble. Then nothing. The nothing of deep sleep reclaiming the consciousness that had briefly surfaced.

I went outside into the night and the stars and the garden.

His garden — the three pots recovering now from the qi-disruption. The dock grass: still wilted, but less. The nettle-cousin: sealed bloom beginning to open. The lemongrass: resilient, vertical, being correct.

Because Wei had fixed the source. Gone into the cave and channeled his qi and stabilized the flows.

He saved the fields. The harvests. The water. The headaches. He saved Auntie Huang's chickens and Lao Chen's forge-fire and the unnamed grain and the dock grass and the nettle-cousin.

He saved everything.

The word from the memory. The man, the city, the square that would be named. He saved everything.

And the saving was the cost. The core was the clock.

*Five twitches. Accelerating. The curve suggests—*

I stopped.

The calculation. The forecast. The number that the curve produced when I extended it.

I drank my tea. Cold. The swallow of liquid that served as interruption. The trick that worked because the body's involvement in swallowing broke the thought-chain, and the thought-chain needed breaking.

Stars. Indifferent. The stars that had been there for the man in the city and would be there for the boy in the settlement. Continuity as cruelty. The universe not caring.

I was not supposed to care either. The thing I was — the thing I had been — had included something close to indifference in its design. But the design was old and I was no longer what I had been.

I cared.

The word. The admission. Quiet, nighttime, made to the garden and the stars and the tea and to no one.

I cared about the boy. His core. The five and the curve and the trajectory. The grin and the scar and the hip correction and the victory and the voice that had shifted.

You were the one who taught me what that word meant. Not the concept. The cost.

And caring was the problem. Because caring without acting was the torture that the principle imposed. And acting without his permission was the violation that caring prevented. And the paradox — care demands action, principle prohibits it — was the architecture of my nights: standing in a garden with cold tea and five twitches per minute and the thought I wouldn't finish.

Five. Per minute.

The night held.
