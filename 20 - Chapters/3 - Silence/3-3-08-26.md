Healer Mao arrived at dusk.

He came because he always came when someone returned from the forest injured, because the settlement's information network was Auntie Huang and Auntie Huang's network was sound — she heard everything, relayed everything, and her relaying was journalism conducted at volume.

Mao was old. Older than Lao Chen, though they disagreed about by how much. His hands were steady despite the age, and his qi-sensitivity was rudimentary — the kind that came not from cultivation but from decades of proximity to the qi-rich valley. He couldn't channel. He couldn't fight. He could feel. And feeling was enough for his purposes: broken bones, fevers, herbs, poultice, the medicine of the body rather than the spirit.

He examined the woodcutter first. Set the leg properly — corrected the angle, tightened the binding. Professional. The competence of having seen six hundred broken legs and set five hundred and ninety-eight of them correctly.

Then he came to Wei.

"Heard you fought something," he said. Understated. He'd heard Auntie Huang's version — a beast the size of a horse and a fight lasting an hour — and had performed the necessary division to arrive at truth.

"Rock lynx," Wei said. Still grinning.

Mao put his hands on Wei's chest. Closed his eyes. Palms flat, fingers spread, the maximum-contact configuration that his rudimentary sensitivity required.

He felt.

His brow furrowed. Something partly familiar, partly not — the known layered with the unknown.

"Your core is... bright."

He said it carefully. The tentative delivery of an observation that might be wrong and whose wrongness would be embarrassing but whose rightness would be concerning.

"Bright?" Wei asked.

"More than I'd expect. For—" Mao waved vaguely. For your age, for your level, for whatever categories he was using that didn't have room for what he was feeling.

"Too bright?" Not worried. Curious. More was an achievement and achievements were positive.

Mao paused. Data insufficient for conclusion.

"No. Just — different."

He withdrew his hands and tapped his chin — the habitual gesture of processing in progress.

"Rest, boy. And drink more water."

He didn't know what he'd felt. Not precisely. He'd felt wrongness — the intuitive detection from thirty years of putting his hands on bodies and this not feeling like supposed-to. But the wrongness had no name in his vocabulary. No category.

He left. Chin-tapping. Internally uneasy.

Wei shrugged. "He always says drink water."

"Water is important."

"You sound like him."

I didn't respond. Because responding would have required choosing between: Yes, water is important, and the truth. And the truth was a word I could not say to him because saying it was directing and directing was the thing I would not do.

Wei went to his room. To rest. To drink water. To grin about the lynx.

I stood in the kitchen.

What I had seen during Mao's examination — while his rudimentary hands detected brightness, I had been seeing something else. Something beneath his perception.

Wei's core. Visible to me in the spectrum that my senses accessed. Visible and wrong.

Four twitches per minute. Confirmed. Up from three. The escalation consistent, gradual, the pace that said: chronic, not acute.

And: the pattern.

His core's luminescence — the golden light I'd been watching for weeks — was organizing. Not randomly, not in the chaotic distribution that normal fluctuation produced. In a spiral.

The light moving in a spiral. From the core's center outward, tracing a curve that was precise, that looked designed rather than emergent.

It could be nothing. Qi did strange things in young cores. Patterns emerged and dissolved. Natural variance. The explanation requiring the fewest assumptions.

Or it could be something.

The spiral moving, slow, like writing too small to read and too persistent to ignore.

I turned away. Poured tea. Let it go cold.

The spiral continued. In his core. In his sleep. In the room where he grinned and rested and was fourteen and was bright and was mine.

The spiral continued.
