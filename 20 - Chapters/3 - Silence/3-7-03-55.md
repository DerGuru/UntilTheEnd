Forest. Rain.

The water fell through the canopy in fragments — broken by leaves and branches into smaller portions that arrived individually. Each drop a separate event. Each event meaningless. The rain hit my face and my arms and my hair and the hitting was: data. Temperature, velocity, mineral content. Not feeling. Data.

Where I walked: brown. The trail continued. Through the undergrowth, between the trees, along no path because no path existed because paths required intention and intention required a destination and destinations required a reason and reasons required—

I stopped.

Standing. In the rain. In the forest. Brown underfoot, green beyond. The sound of rain against leaves: present. Not the silence of the battlefield — sound had returned, at some point. Trauma permitting it when trauma took a breath. You can hear again, but hearing is different now. Hearing is the thing the world does to you when you can't refuse it.

I waited.

Not for rain to stop. Not for direction. For the other thing — the pattern that should have been here, that should have arrived by now, that had been as reliable as breathing for centuries. The architecture.

The memories. The ones that came when loss happened. The parallel experiences — the other deaths, the other bodies, the other times someone I had built something with stopped existing and the stopping produced the gap and the gap produced the memory. The pattern: loss → comparison. Loss → "I remember when." Loss → the other student, the other city, the other era when the same shape appeared and the same shape was the template for understanding this shape.

I waited for it.

Standing in rain. The mind turning toward its archive and opening the door: show me. Show me who. Show me when. Give me the parallel. Give me the student who died similarly. Give me the city that burned that felt like this. Give me the fragment that tells me this is not unique — that this is pattern, that this has happened before, that the before is the framework and the framework is survival.

Nothing.

The archive opened. The door was open. Behind it: shelves, catalogued, organized, millennia of experience sorted by type and era and emotional signature. Everything. Every loss. Every death. Every student, every friend, every person whose name I carried.

None of them came forward.

None. Not the student with the kingdom and the ash. Not the fighter who won and then died. Not the healer with the cold core and the three weeks. None of them.

The memories were there. In the archive. Present, accessible, catalogued. I could feel their presence the way you feel furniture in a dark room — by proximity, by the displacement of air around their edges. They were there.

They didn't come.

Because none of them was him.

That was the thing. The load-bearing thing that the absence communicated and the communication was the devastation — worse than any memory: Wei had no parallel. Not because the deaths were different — deaths were always different, details varied, century varied. But not the weight. The weight was always comparable. The weight always rhymed. One loss could be placed beside another and the placing was the management: I have survived this before. I can survive it again.

This had no beside.

This stood alone in the archive. Uncategorized. Without neighbors. The filing system could not file it because filing required similarity and similarity required precedent and Wei had no precedent because Wei was—

Wei.

The rain fell. The forest stood. The brown grass continued its dying.

I had waited for a memory. No memory came. And the not-coming was worse than any coming because the coming was comparison and comparison was distance and distance was the tool and the tool was unavailable. I was here. In this. Without buffer.

Without the archive's protection.

Without precedent.

In rain. In forest. In the unprecedented grief of a loss that had happened countless times and that had happened for the first time.
