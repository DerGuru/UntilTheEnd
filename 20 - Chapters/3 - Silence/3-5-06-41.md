More signatures.

Six yesterday. Eight today. The progression from observation to deployment — bodies moving into position with the discipline of an operation that had been planned, authorized, and was now executing.

The triangle formation: expanded. No longer three points but a net — overlapping coverage, containment rather than observation. They had finished watching. They were arranging.

Guo had arrived. His presence was detectable not as a signature but as an effect: the shift from autonomous positioning to coordinated positioning. A commander had entered the field. This was no longer scouts. This was a unit.

Wei knew.

Not the details — not formations, not the commander's name. But the knowledge that lived in the body, in the animal perception that even fourteen-year-olds possessed when the animal had been trained to feel when it was being hunted.

He went to Lao Chen's.

The forge — dim, hot, always running. Lao Chen ran it the way he ran his life: continuously, without breaks. Stopping was dying and dying was not in his schedule.

Wei sat. Took his sword — the blade Lao Chen had given him. Functional. Steel folded and hammered and cooled by hands that talked to metal.

He sharpened it. Stone against edge, long strokes, even pressure — the patience of metalwork that was counter to Wei's nature and that he performed anyway because the blade demanded patience and the blade's demands were the only demands he respected unconditionally.

"Sounds right," Lao Chen said from across the forge. Not looking up from his own work.

Wei paused. Put his ear to the metal. Lao Chen's gesture — listen to the blade.

"Is it ready?"

"You're asking me or the steel?"

Wei grinned. Faintly. Not the full grin — the version that existed when fighting was coming and the fighting was real.

"This time I fight," he said. To the blade. To the forge. To the coals.

Lao Chen didn't look up. His hammer found its rhythm again.

"Then fight well," he said. Quiet. Meaning everything.

I worked at night.

He slept — the core flickering through his shirt, the light now visible from across the room. Brighter. The trend continued.

I left the house. Quiet. Moving through darkness the way darkness moved through itself.

The settlement walls. Low — stone and wood, agricultural boundaries rather than fortifications. Not designed for defense.

I traced qi-barriers into the stone. Precise, burned into the material with controlled application of energy that was ancient and efficient. Defenses that would resist qi-assault at any level below Immortal-stage. My hands on the stone, my qi in the stone, the stone accepting both.

Every wall. Every section. The perimeter — complete.

Protection signs. At doors, windows, the well. Each one individually set, each tailored to the angle and material and vulnerability of its position. Artisan craftsmanship of defense, applied because it was the thing I could do. And doing was the alternative to thinking.

Escape routes. Three. North, south, southeast. Through the forest, marked with qi-signs on trees — visible to anyone with rudimentary sensitivity, invisible to anyone without. Wide enough for families. Gentle enough for elderly. Long enough to reach the next settlement.

Hours. The entire night. I worked thoroughly, methodically, with the exhaustion of purpose that was not tiredness but focus.

Everything.

I protected everything. Every wall, window, well, path. Every door, house, every structure containing a person whose living was under threat.

Everything except.

His core.

I could have stabilized it. The technique existed — I had possessed it for millennia. The intervention that could slow the degradation, reinforce the structure, buy time. Time was the currency. Time was what we were running out of.

But stabilizing meant acknowledging. Meant saying: you are important in the way that requires personal intervention, not general defense. Meant admitting the distinction between protecting a settlement and protecting him was the distinction between principle and attachment. And attachment was the word I had been avoiding because attaching was the precursor to losing and losing was the inevitability.

I didn't stabilize his core.

I protected the walls. The windows. The paths.

Everything except him.

And the exception was the error. And the error would cost everything.

I finished before dawn. Sat on the step. Cold tea. Stars fading. The settlement: protected, barriered, signed. Safe as I could make it.

Inside: the boy. The light. The flickering.

The sword — sharpened, ready — leaning against his bed.

Morning approaching.
