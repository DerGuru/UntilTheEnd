Heiler Mao found me at the well.

Morning. Early. The hour before Wei woke â€” the space I occupied for the things that couldn't happen while he was present.

Mao walked slowly. Slower than usual. His chin-tap: absent. His hand hung at his side, the inertia of a gesture that had been habitual and was now exhausted.

He stood beside me. Didn't speak. Assembling a sentence he didn't want to assemble.

"The boyâ€”"

He stopped. Started.

"I can't say what it is. My experience isn't enough. Butâ€”"

He looked at me. Eyes of someone who had arrived at a conclusion beyond his vocabulary and was bridging the gap with: but.

"It's getting faster."

Three words. His diagnosis, his prognosis, his entirety. He had felt Wei's core â€” with rudimentary hands, palms designed for fevers and broken bones. And his rudimentary sensitivity had detected what mine had been measuring: the acceleration. The trend.

He waited. For me to say something.

I said nothing.

He nodded. Acceptance â€” of my silence, of the wall between his knowing-less and my knowing-more.

"You know what it is, don't you."

Not a question.

I said nothing.

He nodded again. Turned. Walked away. Chin-tap still absent. The slow walk of a healer who had identified a problem he couldn't solve.

Evening.

Wei sat at the table. Looked at me. Direct.

"Something's wrong."

I put down my tea.

"Be honest."

Two words. Fair. The demand of someone who was owed information and knew it.

Silence. Long. The silence of someone calculating which truth, how much, how shaped.

"Your qi grew too fast. Your core is unstable."

True. Partially. The partial truth that I had learned â€” across millennia â€” was more effective than lies. Enough verifiable content to be credible. Enough omission to be protective.

Wei absorbed it. No shock â€” the absence that said: I suspected this. I have been feeling the symptoms. I have been calling them 'tired,' and 'tired' was the word I used instead of the word I feared.

"Since when?"

"A while."

"Why didn't youâ€”"

He stopped. The sentence he didn't finish. Why didn't you tell me. The question that hung in the air the way the others had hung â€” the 'not just you' from the kitchen, the 'what IS that' from the well. Sentences as shapes in the space between us.

He didn't finish because the answer was too large. Because telling was directing and directing was controlling and controlling was the thing I had vowed not to do. Or: because I was afraid. Or: because the information wouldn't have helped, and helpful was the only kind I was willing to provide.

All of these. None spoken.

What I also didn't say:

It's my fault. My qi accelerated your development. The proximity, the exposure, the ambient transfer that my presence produced â€” was the cause. I broke you before you knew what breaking meant. Every symptom you're experiencing is the consequence of my existence near yours, of what my nature produced and your young core absorbed.

The guilt-truth. The full truth. The version that included me. As cause. As origin. As the reason.

I said: unstable. Too fast. True. Partially.

The other half â€” the half that was mine â€” I held. Not from courage. Not from strategy. From: protection. But whose? His, from the knowledge that his teacher was his damage? Or mine, from the acknowledgment that my teaching was his breaking?

I didn't know. And the not-knowing was the honest answer. And the honest answer was the only thing I was not providing.

You would have told him. You always were braver than me in that way.

He looked at me. Across the table. Across the tea.

He didn't ask again.
