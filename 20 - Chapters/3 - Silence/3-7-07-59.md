The question remained.

Not answered — that was the point. Not answerable — that might have been the larger point. The question existed in the category of questions not designed for answers but for carrying.

It would drive me. Into the search. Into the investigation the question demanded — not of the world, not of the qi-system, not of the architecture of cultivation, but of myself. Of whatever I was. Of the protection that was mine and that was not his. The crime. The accusation directed at: me. At whatever part of me was the mechanism. At whatever part was the dao or the curse or the fundamental condition that selected for my survival and against his.

But not today.

Today was: standing. In forest. With a question.

The wind moved through the trees. The branches shifted. The sound of a forest breathing — creak of wood, rustle of leaves, the small sounds that constituted the background. The world's way of saying: I am here and I am not listening but I am here.

I stood.

The brown circle: steady. Three paces. Not growing, not shrinking. The equilibrium of an emission that had stabilized because the emission was tied to something and the something had reached its floor. This level. This radius. This amount of dying.

I would carry the question. Into whatever came after this forest, after this rain, after this grey series of days that constituted the aftermath of a death that had no parallel. The question was the thing I would carry because carrying was the only verb available.

Whatever protects me — why not him.

The answer existed. Somewhere. In the architecture of whatever I was and whatever the system was. The selectivity of protection that selected me and rejected him. The answer existed and the answer was findable and the finding would be the search and the search would produce the answer and the answer would be—

But not today.

Today, the question stood. Alone. Without answer. In a forest. In rain that had stopped. In the brown circle of a woman whose grief killed grass and whose question killed something else — the comfort of not-knowing, the peace of assumption, the safety of believing that the universe's indifference was general rather than targeted.

It was targeted. The protection was targeted. At me. And the targeting excluded everyone else.

And the exclusion was the architecture.

And the architecture was the thing I would dismantle.

*You asked the same question. Different words. Same weight.*

But not today.
