Grey morning.

No sun. The sky — flat, low, the colour of metal that had been left in rain. Not the golden morning. Not the brightest morning I'd watched from the step with tea and the feeling that things might be okay. This morning was its opposite and the opposite was its own kind of honesty.

I was at the west wall. High. The position I'd chosen because the position offered overview and overview was the thing I needed. Barriers humming under my palms — the signs I'd carved last night, my qi in the stone, functional, alive.

The first qi-blast hit the horizon. East. A line of white-blue light cutting through the grey.

Then two more. Then four more. Seven total. Coordinated — the timing was the signature, each blast offset by precisely two seconds, the pattern of a unit that had rehearsed. Their rehearsing was the professionalism and the professionalism was Guo.

The well-gong. Someone — I couldn't see who — swinging the hammer. The metallic toll spread across the settlement, bouncing off walls, off roofs, off the barriers that accepted the sound and carried it further. Alarm.

Movement below. Fast. Fragmented. The settlement waking into its emergency — the pattern I'd never explicitly trained but that humans adopted naturally under threat: women and children toward the marked escape routes, men toward the walls, tools in hands. My protection signs at the doors: glowing faintly as people passed through them, the activation of each one confirming that the wards worked and the wards working was the only thing working.

Frau Huang: at her door. Shen beside her — the boy, twelve, the one who didn't hear well and who followed Wei like gravity was a person but the person was Wei and gravity was the friendship.

She pushed him toward the southern escape route. Her mouth moving — shouting, probably, the way she always shouted, the volume that was her nature. He resisted. She pushed harder. Her hands on his shoulders, turning him, aiming him toward the trees.

He went. She watched him go. Turned back.

The qi-blasts: closer. The east perimeter. My barriers: absorbing, deflecting. They would hold. Against this level, they would hold indefinitely. But the blasts were not the point. The point was behind them — the bodies moving in formation, the signatures I'd been tracking for days.

Eight. Plus Guo. Plus the pattern that was the deployment.

Wei.

He came through the door. Already standing — not from sleep, from readiness. The sword in his right hand. Lao Chen's blade. His feet: bare. His shirt: the light at his sternum bleeding through the fabric in the grey morning air a second heartbeat visible to anyone with eyes.

He ran.

Across the central path, between the houses, toward the east gate. Running the way he always ran — fast, direct, the straight line that adolescence believed was the shortest distance between two points and that adolescence was right about.

He didn't look back.

Not at the house. Not at me. The same gesture — identical — to that first morning: running to Lao Chen's, not looking back, the morning receding behind him. Except then it was safety. Now it was the opposite.

I tracked from the west wall. The formation: visible in the precision. East gate: the primary assault vector. South-west: secondary — I could feel signatures there, two, flanking. North: one, maybe two, holding position.

Containment. Not siege. Guo wanted something exact and the precision was Wei and Wei was running toward the east gate where the precision was waiting.

A qi-blast hit the east wall. Stone cracked. My barrier absorbed the follow-through — dispersed it, scattered it, the structural integrity holding. The crack: cosmetic. The barrier: functional.

Another blast. Another. The rhythm — two-second intervals, the rehearsed pattern, the professional unit executing its operation.

I stayed at the west wall. High. Overview.

Below: the settlement responding. Settlers at the walls with farming tools — shovels, hoes, the instruments of agriculture repurposed as the instruments of survival. Not soldiers. Civilians with steel.

Wei at the east gate. Standing in the opening. The sword up. His qi: flaring.

And west — behind me, beyond me, 200 paces into the treeline and up the slope — something else.

A signature.

Not Guo's people. Not sect. Something larger. Deeper. The kind of presence that displaced the air around it. Their displacement was the announcement and the announcement was: I am here, and here is wherever I choose to be.

I marked it. Filed it. Turned my attention back to the east gate.

Wei was about to fight.
