Morning.

I stood at the window. Wei trained outside — the forms, the transitions, the vocabulary of motion that I had demonstrated and he had absorbed and that was now his, fully, in the way that learned things became owned things when the learner forgot the teacher.

The hip correction. There. Third to fourth position. Invisible to anyone who wasn't looking for it and visible to anyone who was.

Fang Liang had been looking for it.

I watched Wei move through the sequence. Clean. Efficient. The body of someone trained by someone who knew what training meant — and whose surface was: an acquaintance who was adequate.

The dilemma.

I could warn him.

I could cross the room, open the door, and say: The Iron Lotus is a proxy sect. Their hierarchy is competent but predatory. Their masters teach well because teaching well produces better resources, and resources are their product. Their product is bodies with qi who can fight and die in the service of agendas they will never see.

I could tell him about recruitment. The initial generosity, the access, the belonging that was conditional on performance and whose conditionality was invisible until you tried to leave and discovered that leaving was not in their vocabulary.

I could tell him what happened to young talents who entered sects at fourteen with extraordinary qi and instinctive hip corrections and brown eyes. I had the firsthand knowledge of someone who had watched sects consume talent for longer than most sects had existed. The pattern was predictable.

But.

Telling him was directing him. Directing was controlling. Controlling was the thing I'd dismantled — deliberately, methodically. If he's not free to choose, then every choice I make for him is a prison with better lighting.

The hesitation. Not indecision — philosophy made physical. The gap between what I could do and what I should do. He has to learn. *If I solve everything, he learns nothing. And if he learns nothing, he dies the first time I'm not there.*

The first time I'm not there.

That sentence. The one from the kitchen weeks ago, lodged between ribs where thoughts went to calcify. Simultaneously the reason for everything I was doing and the prediction of everything I was afraid of.

I could warn him. A good teacher would walk out there and say: Fang Liang is not your friend. His smile is infrastructure. The hip correction was a hook and the fish is you.

But a good teacher also knows: fish that are warned about hooks don't learn to identify hooks. They learn to distrust warnings.

Wei finished his forms. Came inside. Sweaty, breathing hard, the exertion flush of a body used well.

He looked at me. In the window.

"How was it?" he asked.

A choice. Right now. In the kitchen. In the morning light. With the tea — cold — in my hand.

"Your seventh-form exit drifts left. A centimeter."

He nodded. Processing. A centimeter. The kind of feedback that was useful and that maintained the structure — teacher, student, the exchange of technical information when the other languages were too large and too dangerous.

He went outside. Repeated the seventh-form. Corrected the drift.

I watched. From the window. With my tea. With my warning — unsaid, undelivered.

The gamble was always him.

You never gambled. You calculated. I envied that until I saw what calculation cost you.
