The air tasted like metal.

Brief â€” a flash of iron on the tongue, lasting a fraction of a second and then not. Like tasting a memory of blood. A flavor too brief for confirmation, too present for doubt.

I stood outside. Afternoon. The sun was warm and normal. Beneath the normal: a tremor. Not earthquakes â€” not surface vibration. Deeper. In the bones. The resonance that happened when something immensely powerful moved through a region and the region responded by vibrating at the structural level.

An Immortal-stage cultivator was moving into the valley.

The signature was not direct â€” at this distance, I caught the secondary effects. The displacement. Like water responding to a ship: not seeing the ship, seeing the wake. The wake was: metal taste, bone-tremor, the quality of air compressed by proximity to something vastly beyond anything the local environment contained.

I hadn't felt one in centuries. Immortal-and-beyond â€” cultivators whose power existed not as strength but as weather. They moved rarely. They moved for reasons. Their reasons were not small.

I looked west. Saw nothing. Mountains, forest, sky.

I felt everything. The slow swell. Like an ocean rising â€” not a wave. Just: more water.

One sentence of evidence. The metal taste. Then: gone.

I went inside. Said nothing.

Evening. Dinner.

Wei sat at the table. He'd trained slower today â€” the conscious deceleration that was his solution to the problem I'd half-described.

Calm. Relaxed. Post-training, requesting fuel.

Rice. Chopsticks in his left hand â€” he was left-handed for eating, right-handed for fighting. He reached for the bowl with his right.

His hand went through the bowl.

Not physically through â€” the grip didn't engage. His fingers closed the motion of grasping and produced nothing. As though the connection between will and hand had been interrupted â€” a fraction of a second where the hand was there but not operational. Intention sent. Execution absent.

The bowl tipped. Rice hit the floor. Ceramic on wood, then the scatter of grains.

Silence.

Wei stared at his hand. Open. He closed it. Opened it. Closed it. Testing the mechanism. Finding it operational now, which didn't explain non-operational then.

"Just tired."

Fifth time. The phrase that had been explanation, then refrain, and was now liturgy â€” words that had lost their informational content and retained only ritual function. This is what we say when this happens.

I continued eating. My chopsticks: stable. My hands: could hold mountains. The contrast sitting across from me with rice on the floor and a hand that had betrayed him.

He picked up the bowl. Scooped the rice back in â€” the recoverable portion. The practicality of someone who didn't waste food because food had been scarce.

He ate. With his left hand. The right: in his lap. Hidden.

I ate. Across from him. With stable hands and full information and silence.

The taste of metal was gone. The bone-tremor: continuing, below awareness. The Immortal-stage presence settling into the region the way weather settled â€” slowly, altering conditions without announcement.

Two threats. External: the sect, closing in, signatures at the tree line multiplying. Internal: his core, deteriorating, grip-failure being the new entry in the vocabulary of Stage 3.

Stage 3.

Warmth. Tremor. Voice-shift. Grip-failure. The progression through its stages, each producing a new symptom. The catalog I was maintaining. The catalog that was full.

*What comes after Stage 3?*

After grip-failure, core-breach. After core-breachâ€”

I stopped eating. Put my chopsticks down. Aligned.

"More rice?" I asked.

He looked at me. His right hand still in his lap.

"Yeah."

I served him. From the pot. Into the bowl his hand had dropped. Rice: warm, fragrant, normal. The act: ordinary. The ordinariness being the performance I could manage when everything else was the catalog and the countdown and the two threats and the silence.

He ate. Left hand. Right hand in his lap. The hand that was fine now and would be fine tomorrow and would be fine until it wasn't.

I sat across from him and held my chopsticks and held the silence and held the metal taste and the bone-tremor and the catalog's final entries and the sound of rice on wood and the word â€” tired â€” becoming hollow.
