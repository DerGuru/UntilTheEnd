The boy came back. The sect didn't.

That is the version Wei believed.

The reality — the version that existed in the frequencies I monitored — was different.

Fang Liang stood at the sect gate.

I know this because I watched. Not directly — I didn't follow, didn't leave the house during the six hours Wei was gone. I watched through the ambient qi-field, through the resonances and signatures that existed between sensation and perception.

Fang Liang stood at the gate and the smile was not there.

His face — the real face, the one beneath the infrastructure of friendliness, revealed whenever the audience departed. The eyes: calculating. The mouth: flat, someone processing results.

"Did you eat?" I asked when Wei returned. Evening. Kitchen. His shoes by the door, his face carrying the residue of a day spent elsewhere.

"At Lao Chen's."

"What did he say?"

"That my edge-angle is improving. That I should stop rushing the final stroke." He looked at me. "You already knew I went back to the sect."

"Yes."

"And you're not going to say anything about it."

"What would you like me to say?"

He considered. Shook his head. Went to his room.

He wrote.

Fang Liang. On jade. Not paper — jade. The writing medium of formal transmission, of records meant to last. I felt the inscription — faint, directional, the hum of structured information being encoded into stone. The content: invisible at this distance. But the act said: this matters. This is being recorded. This is being sent.

Wei's qi-profile. The data Fang Liang had collected — not through conversation, not through warmth and mirroring and hip-correction observation. Through direct analysis. The qi-sensing that a senior disciple performed continuously, automatically, the way I performed continuous analysis: invisibly.

He had Wei's signature. His range. His instability.

The micro-fluctuations. The twitches I counted at night — three per minute, maybe four now — were not invisible to someone with Fang Liang's training. They were data. And data, inscribed on jade, was portable. And portable data was transmissible.

The jade tablet: sent. To someone in a hierarchy. About my boy walking barefoot through a market with his qi uncontained and his trust the vulnerability.

Facts.

Fact: Fang Liang had transmitted Wei's qi-profile.

Fact: The transmission went somewhere. A decision-maker who would read the data and produce a conclusion: ignore, monitor, acquire.

Fact: Wei's profile — extraordinary qi, instability markers, training from a competent but unaffiliated source — would not produce "ignore."

Fact: I had not warned him.

Fact: I was not going to warn him.

Fact: the reason was the principle. He has to learn to identify threats himself. If I identify them for him, he identifies me as the threat-identifier, and the identification creates dependence, and the dependence creates the gap, and the gap is lethal.

Fact: the gap might be lethal regardless.

I sat in the kitchen. Night. Wei in his room — asleep, his core broadcasting soft golden light through his shirt.

The jade tablet was traveling. The machinery was in motion.

I had information. He did not. The asymmetry of knowledge between someone who perceived everything and someone who perceived the things a fourteen-year-old perceived. The asymmetry I was maintaining. Deliberately. As policy.

The policy was the principle.

And the principle might kill him. Or save him.

You held the same thing once. Different hands. Same weight.

And the gamble was all I had.
