The celebration happened the way settlements celebrated â€” improvised, organic, the assembly of people who had been frightened and were no longer frightened and whose relief required expression: fire, food, and noise.

Someone produced a flute. An old man â€” the same old man who produced a flute at every gathering because his flute was his contribution and his contribution was reedy and imperfect and exactly right.

Food. The communal inventory of a settlement pooling its resources â€” dried meat, preserved vegetables, the good rice that someone had been saving for an occasion. Frau Huang cooked. Volume optional, quality mandatory.

Fire. Central. The gathering point around which bodies arranged themselves in the ancient geometry of community â€” the circle, the warmth, the democracy of a ring where everyone was equidistant from the heat.

Wei sat in the middle.

Not at the edge â€” not where I sat, cup in hand, back against a wall, the architecture of proximity-without-participation that was my register. In the middle. Among people. Part of them.

He was talking. Animated. The post-crisis narration performed with the commitment I had documented across three parts and seven lynx-retellings: embellishment as craft, exaggeration as enthusiasm, truth as skeleton and fiction as flesh.

"And the qi was PULLINGâ€”" His arms demonstrated the pulling. Significantly more dramatic than reality, where it had been subtle and directional and had required concentration rather than arm gestures. "â€”and I had to channel EVERYTHING into the node, and the node wasâ€”"

"Tell about the rumbling!" Frau Huang's son. From somewhere in the circle. Bouncing.

"I'm GETTING thereâ€”"

He described the stabilization. The settlers listened. Not because the description was accurate â€” it wasn't â€” but because Wei was the person who had saved them, and saved-people got to describe things however they wanted.

"And thenâ€”"

The sentence.

The thing that happened.

Mid-word. Mid-gesture. Mid-grin. His voice changed.

"â€”the crack in the qi wasâ€”"

Deep. The word dropped an octave. More â€” the tonal shift that went beyond pitch into timbre, into the thing that made a voice a voice and that had been his and was momentarily not.

Older. As though the mouth producing the sound belonged to someone else â€” someone adult, someone whose vocal cords had been weathered by decades rather than formed by fourteen years. A voice with no business emerging from a boy sitting cross-legged in firelight.

One sentence. Less than a sentence. Four words. Duration: roughly a second and a half.

The settler beside Wei â€” a carpenter, forty-something â€” looked at him. The look of someone who had heard something wrong and was processing it. Confused. Briefly. Then: dismissed. Because dismissing was easier than investigating, and investigating led to questions, and questions led to answers nobody wanted at a celebration.

Wei continued talking. Normal. His voice: his. The four words absorbed into the narrative, filed under: irrelevant. He hadn't noticed. Not the shift. Not the look. Not the window during which his voice had been someone else's.

I sat against the wall. Tea â€” cold. The cup in both hands. Grip tight.

Not his voice. What was it?

One: his core distorting physical output. Qi-instability expressing through the vocal cords, producing a temporary alteration. Mechanical. Explicable.

Two: his future self. The voice of who he would become if his body survived â€” an older Wei, a deeper Wei. The Wei on the other side of fourteen. If fourteen had an other side.

Three: something speaking through him. The core as conduit rather than source.

I didn't choose. Choosing required investigation. Investigation required the context I was avoiding.

The carpenter looked away. The celebration continued. The flute played. The food was eaten. The fire burned.

Wei grinned. Talked. Was Wei.

I held my tea. In the cold cup. In the tight hands. In the quiet.

Stage 2. The clock that had started with warmth and prickling and two-second pauses. That had progressed to trembling hands and clenched fists. That now included: voice.

*What comes after voice?*

I didn't want to think about it.

The fire crackled. Wei laughed. Someone passed more food. The flute played its reedy, imperfect song.

I sat. Against the wall. In the cold. In the knowing.

Alone in it.
