The last exchange.

The lynx charged â€” lower still, having learned twice, adapted.

Wei didn't dodge. Didn't roll. Didn't redirect.

He channeled.

Everything. All of it. The qi held in reserve, the stored energy that training had taught him to maintain as backup. The emergency fund that you didn't touch unless emergency was the situation and the situation was now.

His right hand â€” palm open, fingers spread â€” erupted. Golden light. Not the controlled output of a trained technique but the full, unmodulated discharge of a core operating at maximum without limit.

The qi-pulse hit the lynx mid-charge.

The animal stopped. Not decelerated. Stopped. Seventy kilos of enhanced predator in flight, committed to the attack, and the boy's pulse overwhelmed it â€” force meeting force, and one was significantly larger, and the larger was Wei's.

The lynx flew backward. Three meters, four, five â€” tumbling, fur rippling, its qi-lines stuttering and failing, the animal overloaded by the input.

It landed. Hard. On its side in the undergrowth.

For a moment: nothing. The forest held its breath. The birds waited. The stream trickled. The clearing suspended between violence and aftermath.

Then the lynx stood. Slowly. Shakily. Its qi-lines: dim. Its posture: different. The aggression was gone. In its place: reassessment. The adjustment a predator made when it discovered that the hierarchy was wrong and the boy was the apex.

The lynx turned. Walked into the undergrowth. Not running â€” walking. The dignity of retreat.

Gone.

Wei stood.

Alone. In the center of the clearing. The trampled grass. The displaced earth. The blood â€” his blood, on his arm, on the ground, on the shredded sleeve.

His left shoulder: open, diagonal, deep. The wound that would scar.

His hands: trembling. The post-combat vibration of a body returning from beyond its capacity.

His face: bloody. Sweat and dirt and the red smear of a hand that had touched his wound.

His expression.

The grin.

The radiant, undefeatable grin of a fourteen-year-old boy who had just fought a qi-enhanced rock lynx alone and won.

"I did it!"

Loud. At the forest. At the sky. At me.

"I DID IT!"

Thenâ€”

His breath stopped.

Two seconds. Not a gasp, not a stutter â€” a full cessation. His chest: immobile. His mouth: open, mid-grin, frozen. His eyes: unchanged, still victorious, still bright, still the eyes of someone who had won and didn't know that the winning had a clause.

A warmth. I felt it from eight meters â€” the sudden, internal bloom of heat from his core, radiating outward through his chest, his shoulders, his arms. Not painful. Warm, pleasant, the sensation of sunshine absorbed and redistributed.

Prickling. On his skin â€” goosebumps, the body's response to a qi-event it couldn't categorize.

Two seconds. His breath returned.

He blinked. Rubbed his chest â€” casually, the way you rubbed a stitch. The gesture of someone filing an anomaly under: exertion.

"Just tired," he said. To himself. To the forest. To the grin that was still on his face.

I uncurled my fists. Slowly. The crescents in my palms releasing as my fingers straightened. Iron on my tongue.

The qi-clock.

It had started. The two-second stop, the warmth, the prickling â€” these were not exertion. These were the symptoms of a core exceeding containment, physical overflow. Stage one. The beginning of what I'd been watching for.

Him, grinning, bloody, victorious, rubbing his chest.

Just tired.

"Come on," I said. "Let me look at your shoulder."
