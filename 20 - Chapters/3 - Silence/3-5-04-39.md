"Then I'll train slower."

Morning. He stood in the doorway. Already dressed. Already decided.

"What?" I asked.

"You said too fast. So: slower."

He looked at me. The look of someone who believed in the relationship between problem and solution. Rational. Linear. Fourteen.

"That's not—"

"What?"

"—so simple."

"Why not?"

Because his core couldn't slow down. Because the acceleration wasn't from his training — it was from me. Because the instability was structural, not behavioral, and structural problems didn't respond to behavioral solutions.

"Train slower," I said.

Because what else. The full truth — the causal truth, the guilt-truth? He wouldn't understand the mechanism. And understanding wouldn't change it. And changing it required an intervention that I could perform and that performing required acknowledging. And acknowledging was the door I would not open.

He went outside. Trained. Slower. The deliberate deceleration of movements that wanted to be fast. He moved through the forms at half-tempo, concentrated, his face set with the determination of someone who had identified velocity as the variable and the variable as controllable.

It wouldn't work. I knew this. His training speed was not the cause. The cause was the core. The core was the clock. The clock was independent of the training.

But I watched him train slower and I said nothing more because saying more required the truth.

He finished. Stood. Wiped sweat. Looked at me.

"Better?" he asked.

"Yes," I lied.

He went back to the forms. Slower still. The body of a boy who believed that discipline was the solution to everything and whose belief was the thing that made him Wei.

I stood at the edge. Watching.

The trigger should have fired.

A student. In danger. Young, talented, trained by me, now facing the consequence. The pattern that had reliably produced memories — the firing, the image, the lesson, the sentence: *There was someone else who—*

Nothing came.

The archive was empty. No face. No name. No era. No: *before, someone else, the same grin, the same symptoms.*

Wei had no parallel.

Or: I was too close. He was too near, too present, too much himself. I couldn't see him clearly enough to compare him.

No memory came.

I stood. Watched him train. Slower. The forms at half-speed. The deliberate restraint that wouldn't work but that he believed would work.

He finished. Looked at me.

"Better?"

"Yes."

The second lie. Or the same lie repeated. Your slower training is working. The solution you've identified is correct.

He went inside. To eat. To rest. To be fourteen and slower and believing.

I stood in the silence where the memory should have been. In the empty archive.

*He's different.*

The sentence that had been hope. That was now fact. That was now problem.

Different. With no parallel. With no roadmap. With no prior case to consult.

For the first time: I didn't know what would happen next.
