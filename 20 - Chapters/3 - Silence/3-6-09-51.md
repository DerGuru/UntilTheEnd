I stood up.

Slowly. The way someone stood when the thing they were lifting was not their body but the weight of everything their body contained. Slowly, because slowly was the only available speed.

I stood.

The silence held. The world without sound — persistent, total. Not the world being quiet but my perception refusing the world's noise.

I stood.

Under my feet: the grass. Green. Late-summer settlement grass that had been walked on by settlers and animals and children for years. Alive because grass was alive.

It died.

Not metaphorically. Under my left foot: brown. Spreading outward from the sole like a stain. Under my right foot: the same. Brown, dry — plant tissue exposed to qi that was not radiation but grief expressed as energy expressed as destruction.

The circle widened. Five paces. Ten. Fifteen. Dying in a radius — outward from where I stood. The qi leaving my body the way heat left a furnace: through every surface, in every direction, without intention.

Twenty paces. The flowers at the edge of the communal garden: wilting. Stems bowing. Petals falling. The small herbs along the path: curling inward, browning.

Twenty-five. Thirty.

Not the entire settlement. Not the world. A radius. Limited by limits I possessed — the only thing between the dying and everything dying.

The settlers felt it.

The man by the well — one who had stood at the wall with farming tools — staggered. His hand: on the well's edge. His face: pale, then green. He bent, doubled over. Nausea. The response of a human body exposed to qi-emission at a frequency human systems rejected because rejecting was surviving.

Another. A woman by the north wall. Blood in her mouth — not from injury but from the capillary response that qi-saturation produced in untrained bodies. She spat. Red. Looked at it. Looked at me.

The expression on her face.

Not anger. Not understanding. A person seeing something they could not categorize — a woman standing in a circle of dead grass whose standing was the cause of the dead grass.

Another man: on his knees. Not praying — failure of orientation. Balance disrupted at high frequencies. He couldn't tell up from down. His hands: on the ground. Searching.

The air: heavy. Metallic. Blood and ozone and something older, something predating this century — hanging in the atmosphere like a fact.

I was not doing this. I was. Both. The distinction between intention and expression being the distinction between murder and weather and the weather was: this.

I stood.

The dead grass: spreading. The nausea: spreading. The blood-taste: spreading. Each one a symptom of the same cause and the cause was me. Standing in the middle of a dying circle in a grey morning beside a dead boy with torn hands.

The settlers who were close enough: moved away. Not running — staggering, crawling. They moved away from me the way animals moved away from fire — not because fire was hostile but because fire was fire and fire's nature included burning.

No one approached the body. No one approached me. The circle: isolating. The dead grass: a border. The border: mine.

I existed in the circle.

The silence. The dead grass. The spreading radius.

Shen — the boy, Frau Huang's son — was outside the circle. Fifteen paces beyond the edge. Sitting on the ground. Crying — soundless, in my perception. His mouth: open. His hands: over his ears. Whether the sound was too much for him or the silence was too much for him was a distinction I could not make.

I stood in the dead grass.

Holding nothing. Touching nothing. Looking at the body I had not touched because touching was the thing I denied and the denial still held because denial was the only structure remaining. I will not collapse into this. I will not become the version that collapses. I will stand. In dead grass. In silence.

Standing.
