Three days. Three qi-surges. The interval was shrinking.

Day one: surge at dawn. Wei woke gasping. His core visible through his shirt — the glow no longer limited to sleep. He dampened it. Three breaths, core locked, signature reduced. Sat breathing hard, hands between his knees. Tremor: hands and forearms now. Both. Continuous.

"Fine," he said.

"I didn't ask."

"I know. I'm telling you anyway."

Day two: surge at midday. Walking. No warning. His gait stuttered — the brief disconnection between intention and execution. He caught himself. Stood. Steadied. Nose: a line of red, left nostril, wiped with the back of his hand.

Day three: surge at continuous. Not an event — a state. His core vibrating constantly, the hum now present at all hours.

Stability count: three.

Three out of ten. Where ten was healthy and one was Xu Ran.

He laughed.

At a bird. Small, brown, mountain bird — collided with a pine branch, overcorrected, spiraled improbably, and landed on a rock with the expression of a creature pretending the landing was intentional.

Wei laughed. Genuine. A sound I hadn't heard in weeks.

"You're staring," he said.

"I was watching the bird."

"The bird left."

"Then I was watching where the bird was."

He gave me a look. Amused. Allowing it.

Glass. The word surfaced uninvited and left before I could look at it.

"We're going deeper into the range," I said.

"We're already in the mountains."

"Higher. Deeper."

"Why?"

"Because out there, nobody is."

"And if I—" He stopped. The same broken sentence. The same unfinished thought. "If I—"

"Then we're alone."

"That's what you said last time."

"The answer hasn't changed."

He looked at me. Long. Then he shouldered his pack.

"Okay," he said.

"Okay."

We walked west. Into the deeper range where the air was thin and the rock was bare. Wei set the pace — faster than yesterday. As if the decision had loosened something. Or as if something behind us was gaining.

Wind from ahead. Cold. Carrying nothing.

Three. Out of ten. And falling. But walking.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [CRITICAL]: E:R ratio shifted from ~25:75 to ~55:45 by cutting glass-motif analysis (3 paragraphs → 1 sentence), bird-laugh over-explanation, and analytical reflection; added physical momentum at chapter end
- Fixed [HIGH]: "the [N] of" tic removed (3 instances); penultimate ending now drives toward Ch72 with "But walking"
- Applied Global Patterns: Dialog-bricht-Introspektion maintained; Show-don't-tell for Wei's decision (shouldered pack vs. analyzed wanting)
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: Cutting the glass over-analysis frees the Leitmotif to resonate without dissection, and the new ending creates forward momentum into the finale
