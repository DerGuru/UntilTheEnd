Wei approached Xu Ran at noon.

I didn't stop him. Stopping him would have required a reason, and the reason was a truth I couldn't share.

Wei walked to Xu Ran's table. Sat down. Not across — beside. The configuration that communicated: *I'm not here to face you. I'm here to sit with you.*

Xu Ran looked at him. The face of an eighteen-year-old who had been a prodigy and was now a ruin, being approached by a thirteen-year-old whose qi-pattern he'd read as a warning.

"You're the boy," Xu Ran said. "From last night. With the—" He paused. "—the woman."

"Yun."

"Is that her name?"

Wei shrugged. The shrug of someone who knew the answer and was choosing not to elaborate.

"Your qi is suppressed," Xu Ran said. Matter-of-fact. "You're holding it in. But it leaks."

Wei's jaw set.

"At your age, with that density — you shouldn't need to suppress. Suppression at Foundation level means excess. And excess at your age means—" He stopped.

"Means what?"

"Fast growth."

"Is that bad?"

Xu Ran looked at his own hands. The hands that had once produced qi-output sufficient to challenge a tribulation and that now couldn't light a candle.

"I was the fastest in my generation," he said. "Foundation in six months. Core Formation in a year. They called me the Morning Star." He turned his hands over. Palm up. Empty. "Now I can feel the weather through my core crack. That's what's left."

"What happened?"

"I tried to ascend. Triggered a natural tribulation. My core was — I thought it was ready." A sound that might have been a laugh if it had contained any of the qualities laughter required. "It wasn't."

"The sky thing. The wave. The village."

Xu Ran's eyes widened. A fraction. "You were there?"

"I was there."

Five seconds of silence.

"I didn't—" Xu Ran began. Stopped. "The village wasn't — I didn't know people would—"

"They did."

Not accusatory. Not forgiving. Factual.

Xu Ran looked at the table. At the grain of the wood.

"Then why are you sitting here?"

Wei considered this.

"Because I wanted to see what you look like."

Not cruel. Not kind. Honest. To put a face on the event that had changed his life.

Xu Ran met his eyes. Two boys — one broken, one breaking — looking at each other across a gap six years wide and a lifetime deep.

"And?" Xu Ran asked.

Wei stood. Pushed the chair in.

"You look tired."

He walked back. To me.

"Satisfied?" I asked.

"No."

"But?"

"But I saw."

He sat. Ate. The noodles were cold. He ate them anyway.
