His mother came to me at dusk.

I was at the barrier wall — the eastern one, the one I'd rebuilt twice and reinforced three times and was now checking for the fourth time because the tremors were increasing in frequency and each one tested the joints in ways that previous tremors hadn't. The stones held. They would hold through the tribulation's secondary effects. They would not hold through the primary shockwave, but the primary shockwave would be addressed differently, and that plan lived in a part of my mind I hadn't shared with anyone.

She appeared at the bottom of the slope. Alone. No Wei, no other villagers, no pretense of being in the area for any reason other than the one that had brought her. She climbed the slope carefully — her body thin in the way that illness makes bodies thin, conserving energy for an expenditure she couldn't yet identify. Wei's father had died two months ago. The disease had been slow and thorough.

She reached me. Stood. Didn't sit — this wasn't a sitting conversation. Her hands were at her sides, cracked at the knuckles. Old cracks. Untreated.

We looked at each other.

Her eyes didn't ask for comfort. They asked for an answer.

"He doesn't listen to me," she said.

No preamble. No hedging. The directness of a woman who had spent her entire life being indirect and had, in the crucible of the past weeks, lost interest in the practice.

"He listens," I said.

"He doesn't stop."

She was right. He didn't stop. The water runs, the rationing, the patrols, the repairs — she'd asked him to rest and he'd nodded and then not rested and she'd asked again and he'd said "after" and after never came because there was always something after after.

"He listens to you," she said.

This was also true. He did listen to me, in the way that students listen to teachers they've chosen rather than been assigned — with a voluntary attentiveness that couldn't be commanded because it had never been extracted by command. He listened because I'd earned it, stone by stone, lesson by lesson, the accumulated currency of accuracy and consistency and the refusal to waste his time with comfort when what he needed was competence.

"He's twelve," she said.

The words landed differently than she intended. She meant them as a reminder — *he's a child, he shouldn't be doing this, someone needs to tell him to stop.* But what I heard — what the words produced in the specific acoustic of my four-thousand-year consciousness — was a statement of fact so obvious and so painful that repeating it was the only way to acknowledge it.

He was twelve. He was carrying water and rationing food and organizing adults and patrolling the perimeter of a village threatened by a force he couldn't see and didn't understand, and he was twelve, and his hands shook, and he gave away his food, and he was twelve.

"Look after my son."

She said it the way people say things that aren't requests and aren't demands and aren't prayers but exist in the space where all three converge. A statement dressed as a sentence but functioning as a transfer — the deliberate, conscious act of a mother placing her son's safety into hands she didn't understand because her own hands weren't enough.

The wind blew. Warm. Dry. Carrying dust.

I looked at her. At the cracked hands and the eyes that had watched a husband die and a son grow up too fast. She'd walked up a slope to find a woman she barely knew, a woman who lived at the forest's edge and whose qualification was nothing more than the observation that her son, her stubborn impossible self-destructing son, listened when this woman spoke.

"He should eat more," I said.

It wasn't a promise. It wasn't an acceptance. It wasn't the words she'd asked for or the reassurance she needed or the categorical statement of protection that the moment demanded.

But she nodded. Slowly. The nod of someone who has heard more than was said and understands more than was meant and recognizes, in five words about food, the shape of something that a different kind of person might have called a vow.

She turned. Walked down the slope. Her footsteps were careful on the loose stone, measured, precise — the walk of a woman conserving energy for something she couldn't yet name.

I watched her go. The light was failing. The valley was gold, then orange, then grey. The horizon pulsed.

I turned back to the wall. Checked the stones. Adjusted one that had shifted a centimeter in the last tremor. The adjustment was unnecessary. I did it anyway.

The stars came out. The boy's mother reached the village, and the village swallowed her into its warmth, and the fire where Wei slept was a small point of light in the dark, and I stood on the hillside with my raw hands and my ancient bones and the weight of five words that were not a promise but functioned as one.

He should eat more.

Yes. He should.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Father timeline — verified. Line 7 already reads "two months ago" (relative), not "two months before Wei found me." No edit needed.
- Fixed [HIGH]: German words — verified. No German words ("Dörfer", "Südhang", etc.) found in this chapter. No edit needed.
