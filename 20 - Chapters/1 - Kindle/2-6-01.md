The door stuck.

I shouldered it open — wood swollen from rain, hinges corroded, the kind of door that survived by being too stubborn to replace. It scraped across a floor that had given up resisting.

The inn smelled like beer and regret.

Both scents were authentic — the beer was being consumed in quantities that suggested dedication rather than pleasure, and the regret was visible in the posture of every person who had ended up here instead of somewhere better.

We entered because Wei needed a bed and I needed information.

Small. Twenty seats. Wooden floor stained with the archaeological record of every spilled drink. A counter, behind which stood a man whose face contained equal parts suspicion and hospitality. Pig Nose. The naming was automatic — a filing system, not a judgment.

"Two," I said. "And food."

Pig Nose assessed us. Three seconds. We passed. Barely.

He pointed to a table. We sat.

Wei ate.

Noodles. Thick, over-sauced, served in a bowl that had been washed recently enough to maintain legal standards. Wei ate them with the intensity of someone who hadn't had warm food in weeks.

His face was relaxed. The muscles around his eyes softened. His jaw loosened. His shoulders dropped to something approaching human.

For a moment — he was thirteen. A boy. Eating noodles. In a noisy inn. With sauce on his chin.

He was suppressing his qi, too. Compressing it inward, reducing his signature to the faintest possible level. The technique was crude — self-taught, improvised. The suppression cost him. His hands, under the table, trembled harder than usual.

He hid them. Under the wood. Under the normality he was constructing.

Another boy sat down. Fourteen, fifteen. Traveler's clothes. No qi.

"These noodles are terrible," the boy said.

"They're WARM," Wei said.

"That's not the same thing."

"It is tonight."

They talked. About nothing. About noodles. About the rain. About the bard in the corner who was drunk enough to sing and not drunk enough to sing well.

Wei laughed. A real one.

I left the moment to him. Turned. Walked to the corner.

The cultivator-merchant was sitting where merchants sit — maximum visual access, minimum exposure. Middle-aged. Thin.

I sat opposite him. Signaled Pig Nose. Rice wine appeared.

"What sects are moving north?"

The merchant evaluated. Professional.

"Iron Lotus has three teams in the field. Heaven's Order is quiet — restructuring, they say. And there's a hermit-master asking questions nobody can answer." He paused. "Questions about someone who stopped the sky."

I sipped the wine.

"Which routes are safe?"

"None." He smiled. "But the western pass is least watched. Nobody goes there because nobody wants to — bad terrain, worse weather."

"What does silence cost?"

"More than rice wine."

I placed a coin on the table. The exact amount that bought compliance without buying loyalty.

He took the coin. Drank his wine. We exchanged nothing further.

I returned to the table. Wei was still talking to the boy — still being thirteen. His hands were still under the table. His smile was still genuine.

I sat. Ate nothing. Watched.

The bard sang badly. The room smelled like beer and regret.

I preferred the beer.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Added physical action hook before the reflective opening — door stuck, shouldered open, wood/hinges detail. Reader enters the scene through Yun's body before Yun's nose. Chapter now opens with movement, not observation.
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The stuck door grounds the reader in physical space and establishes Yun's presence as action before the olfactory/reflective layer lands.
