The days after the lie were quiet.

We moved. West, then northwest. Forested hills giving way to river-valley lowlands. I set the pace. Wei followed.

He'd changed.

Small — invisible to anyone who hadn't been watching him for months. His posture was the same. His stride. His voice carried the same inflection and the same Wei-ness that made him recognizable at distances that exceeded visual range.

But the pauses were longer. The gaps between observations widened. He still pointed out rocks that looked like animals and clouds that looked like faces. Still provided the narrative soundtrack that filled the silence I generated. But in the gaps — where his words usually lived — there was something new.

A question. Unasked. Present.

He'd accepted my answer. He'd complied. He'd said "Okay" and closed his eyes and slept.

And he didn't believe me.

His trust was total but not stupid. He trusted me with his body, his training, his direction, his life. He did not trust me with information that contradicted what his own senses told him. And his senses were telling him that my answer was incomplete.

He didn't push. Pushing wasn't Wei's method.

He waited. I felt the waiting. The feeling was worse than being asked.

The fifth morning. Breakfast was foraged mushrooms and dried meat. Wei ate with the efficient focus he brought to food — appreciative but functional, the metabolism of a boy who was still growing and whose body consumed everything offered without discrimination.

"These taste like feet," he said.

"Don't eat feet."

"I'm comparing."

"To what?"

"Feet."

"You've eaten feet?"

He shrugged. The shrug of a boy who had spent years eating whatever was available and who considered the question irrelevant to the observation.

"The mushrooms in the last valley were better," he said.

"Those were poisonous."

"Tasted better though."

"Taste isn't a survival metric."

"That's what someone who eats foot-mushrooms would say."

The exchange was normal. The rhythm was normal. Everything about it was — normal. And the normalcy was the thing that made the other thing visible. The specific, careful normalcy of a boy who was maintaining the surface while processing something underneath.

He looked at me. Not the casual look of conversation — the look that lasted half a second too long, that carried weight, that was a question wearing the face of attention.

"Yun?"

"Hm."

"Nothing."

He went back to his mushrooms. The "nothing" was not nothing. But it was the closest he would come to asking, and the closest I would come to answering, and the closest either of us would come to acknowledging that the thing between us had shifted.

A sound. Distant. Not thunder — sharper. The crack of qi hitting stone, miles away. Maybe more. Both of us heard it. Wei's head turned north. The direction we'd come from.

The sound didn't repeat.

That night he stood up. Quietly. Walked to the edge of the clearing. Twenty meters.

He trained.

Stabilization exercises. My exercises. He performed them correctly — precisely, with the care of a student who was *testing* rather than *trusting*.

He was testing my answer.

I felt it in his qi-pattern. The methodical quality of a boy told to "train slower" who was training slower and watching whether it produced results.

He trained for an hour. Returned. Lay down. Slept.

He didn't ask "Show me?"

Before the lie, he would have. Every time. The question that cost nothing to ask and included me in his practice and made his growth our project.

He didn't ask now.

I lay in the dark. Eyes open. The bolt held.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Added external interruption — distant qi-crack heard by both characters after the "nothing" exchange. Breaks interior focus, introduces external threat awareness, and gives the chapter a pulse of tension without derailing the quiet tone.
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The shared alertness moment (both heads turning north) does double duty — it's external action AND it shows their bond still functioning despite the lie.
