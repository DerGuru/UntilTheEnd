I walked east and the ground hummed beneath me and the air tasted like metal and the bones in my body — these old, patient, impossible bones — sang.

They knew what was coming. They remembered.

The humming was the same. The vibration in the marrow, the frequency that traveled not through air but through structure — through the mineral density of calcium and phosphorus and the architecture of a skeleton that had been forged in the first era of cultivation and had never, in four thousand years, lost the resonance it had acquired in the violence of its making.

My bones knew this feeling. They knew it the way a soldier's body knows the sound of drums: not as information, but as activation. The vibration said: *fight.*

I kept walking. East. Toward the column. Toward the pulse. Away from the village and the boy and the people moving south on a path I'd built with bleeding hands and human labor because the alternative — the easy alternative, the correct alternative, the alternative that every fiber of my being was currently shouting at me to take — was the thing I'd buried.

The river smell reached me in faint, mineral gusts. Wet stone. Silt. A promise of water that didn't care about prayers.

But the burying was coming undone.

The trigger was the noise — the qi-column's harmonic, low and vast and somehow personal, as though the frequency had been tuned specifically to the instrument of me. It reached into the sediment of memory and pulled, and what it pulled was old and heavy and hot.

I was a fighter.

Not always. Not at the beginning. At the beginning, I was — what? Curious. Observant. Content to exist in a world that was large and interesting and populated by creatures that lived and died in patterns she found fascinating. The observation was enough. For a long time, it was enough.

Then it wasn't.

I didn't recall the exact moment. The exact moment didn't matter — it was the accumulation that mattered, the slow buildup of evidence that observation without action was not neutrality but participation. Watching a village burn and not acting wasn't non-involvement. It was a choice with consequences identical to involvement, except cowardice was less expensive than courage and left no fingerprints.

So I fought.

One memory surfaced cleanly, as if the column had hooked it by the spine and yanked.

A stone room. A meditation array carved into the floor. Children strapped to it — not screaming, not anymore — their developing meridians forced open because adults were impatient. A sect elder standing over them with a calm expression, explaining the necessity of it the way you explain weather.

I remember my hand.

Not the technique. Not the qi. Just the motion: reaching out and ending him in the time it took dust to settle.

I was good at it. You know what that means, coming from me.

No — I was absolute. The gap between me and the things I fought wasn't a contest. It was an absence. The word "fight" was a courtesy I rarely meant.

And it kept repeating. Different banners, identical appetites. Every vacuum I created filled before the dust settled.

A thousand years. Nothing changed.

You can fight a wave. You cannot fight an ocean.

The ground jolted under my feet. A tremor, sharper than the last. Stones clicked against each other somewhere upslope. I steadied myself without breaking stride.

I stopped. The stopping wasn't dramatic — no final battle, no breaking point, no moment of revelation where the futility crystallized into a decision. I simply ran out of the thing that had made me start. The anger. The conviction that fighting mattered. The belief that ending one cultivator, or ten, or a thousand, constituted progress rather than maintenance.

I went back to what I'd been before: an observer. A presence on hilltops, watching. Tired. Older than the anger and smaller than the problem and aware, with a clarity that felt like punishment, that the only thing my thousand years of fighting had produced was a thousand years of evidence that fighting didn't work.

The wind was warm. The ground hummed. The bones sang.

I walked east. Toward the tribulation. Toward the spot where the qi-column met the river and the physics of water absorption could do what physics does — reduce, redirect, neutralize.

My fists were clenched. I didn't remember clenching them. The fingers had curled on their own, the tendons tightening, the knuckles whitening, the body remembering what the mind had tried to forget: the posture of someone who fights. The stance. The readiness. The ancient, useless, intoxicating certainty that if something needed to be ended, I could end it.

I unclenched them. Deliberately. Finger by finger.

I was not going east to fight. I was going east to move stones and dig trenches and redirect water. Physical work. Manual labor. The intervention of a woman with blistered hands and old bones and a commitment — not a promise, never a promise, just a direction that her feet kept choosing — to keep a village alive without becoming the thing she used to be.

The column pulsed. The sky glowed. The bones sang.

I didn't listen.
