The child was sitting by the river.

We came upon him in the early afternoon, at the point where the trail descended to a floodplain and the river spread wide and shallow over stones smoothed by centuries of water.

Small. Four, maybe five. The age where the body is mostly head and the head is mostly eyes and the eyes contain everything that has ever happened to the person behind them, which in this case was short and already too long.

He sat on the bank. Alone. No adults in sight — not hidden, not nearby, not coming. Alone in the absolute sense. Thin. Dirty. The clothes had been someone else's once — too large, torn, worn past poverty into abandonment.

Wei saw him first. Stopped. I felt the change in his qi before I saw his posture shift — a sharpening, a focusing.

"We take him with us."

Not a question. Not a request. A declaration. The tone Wei used when he'd made a decision before the conversation started and was informing rather than consulting.

"No."

He turned. The look. I'd catalogued this look — Category 4: moral outrage, controlled. The kind that didn't explode but burned. Hotter than the explosive kind. More sustained.

"He's alone."

"Yes."

"He'll die here."

"Maybe."

"*Maybe?*"

I met his eyes. Held them.

"We can't. We're being tracked. He'd slow us down. He'd make us visible. He'd need food we don't have and care we can't provide and he'd be in danger he doesn't deserve because of a situation he didn't create."

Every word was true. Every word was a weapon.

Wei's jaw set. The muscle in his cheek flexed and held.

"So we just leave him."

"I didn't say that."

"What then?"

I looked at the boy by the river. At the smallness of him. At his stillness — not calm, not patience, but the inertia of someone who had stopped expecting.

"There's a farm. Half a li south. Smoke from the chimney this morning."

Wei looked at me. Looked at the boy. Looked south.

He walked to the child. Crouched. Said something I didn't hear — low, gentle, the voice he used with animals and children and, on rare occasions, with me.

The boy stood. Looked up at Wei. Took his hand.

They walked south. I followed.

The farm was small — a stone house, a garden, a few scrawny chickens maintaining the fiction of agriculture. A man came out. Middle-aged. The face of someone who had developed an opinion about endurance and whose opinion was negative.

"What?" the farmer said.

"He needs a home." Direct. Wei's negotiation style: moral clarity as substitute for diplomacy.

The farmer looked at the boy. At Wei. At me. At the boy again.

"Not mine."

"I know."

"Feed's tight."

Wei reached into his pack. His hand found the pouch — the thin leather fold that contained everything we had in currency. He opened it. Inside: one coin. The last one.

He held it out.

"Look after him."

The farmer took the coin. Looked at it. Looked at the boy. The moral arithmetic that every person performs when presented with a child and a coin and the question of whether the coin is enough. The arithmetic never resolves. People take the coin anyway.

"Come on, then," the farmer said to the boy. Not warmly. Not cruelly.

The boy went. Without looking back. Without releasing Wei's hand until the farmer's hand replaced it — a pause. Two hands. Then one.

Wei stood. Watched the boy walk into the house. The door closed.

He turned. Walked past me. Back to the trail. His pack lighter by one coin and his expression heavier by something coins couldn't measure.

"That's not enough." Quarter of a li later. Not to me — to the trail, to the air. "One coin. That's nothing."

"It's what you had."

"It's not enough."

"No."

We walked. The river sound faded. Wei's hands — empty now, freed of the last material thing he'd possessed beyond the clothes and the pack — didn't shake. For the first time in days, perfectly still.

I noticed. Filed it. Didn't comment.

The stillness lasted until nightfall. Then the tremor returned. And the stream flowed. And the coin sat in a farmer's pocket, and Wei walked with empty hands and a full core and the weight of someone who had learned, at thirteen, that doing what you can is not the same as doing enough.

He would carry that. I knew — with the certainty of someone who had watched thousands of people learn this lesson and who had never seen anyone put it down.

Welcome to the inventory.
