The cultivator appeared on the path without subtlety.

He was young. Early twenties, lean, the frame that cheap cultivation and cheaper meals produce. Spirit Gathering — low tier. His robes were patched. His sword was blunt. His qi-signature was as remarkable as his appearance: not.

He was walking south. We were walking north. The path was narrow, and the intersection was inevitable.

He felt Wei before he saw him.

I watched it happen. The exact moment — his stride slowed, his head turned, his face changed. The transition from casual disinterest to focused attention, triggered by the qi-signature that Wei was radiating with the unconscious generosity of a candle that doesn't know it's producing light.

He stopped. Stared at Wei. At a thirteen-year-old boy whose qi-output read as Foundation Establishment — middle phase, whose channel architecture was more sophisticated than most Core Formation cultivators achieved in a decade.

"Who trained this boy?"

Flat, reflexive. Someone encountering something that contradicted their understanding of the world.

"That qi-flow pattern — that's impossible for his age."

I was behind Wei. Three steps, as always. My qi-signature was what it always was: nothing. The absence where a presence should be and isn't, the silence that a human mind slides over without realizing it has missed something fundamental.

He didn't notice me. They rarely did.

"Keep walking," I said.

The cultivator flinched. Turned. Looked at me with the delayed recognition of someone suddenly noticing a wall that had been there the entire time.

"Wait. Please. I've never seen—"

"Keep walking."

Wei glanced at me. I walked. He followed. The cultivator stood in the path behind us, his mouth open, his attention locked on Wei's retreating back.

He would tell everyone he met. Each retelling would add detail and subtract accuracy, and the signal would propagate through the cultivator community like smoke through a room — diffuse, pervasive, impossible to contain.

Wei was visible now. His own qi, his own development, his own impossible advancement was producing a signature that other cultivators could read. And the lantern couldn't be dimmed. Not by me. Not yet. The control mechanisms that would allow him to suppress were three cultivation stages away.

Too fast.
