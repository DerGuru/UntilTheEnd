He spoke before he woke.

It was the fourth morning. Grey light through the window, the air still holding the night's chill. His mother had fallen asleep in her corner — exhaustion winning the argument against vigilance — and I was alone with him. Alone with the sound of his breathing and the slow pulse of his qi and the creaking of the hut's walls in a wind that smelled like aftermath.

His lips moved.

Not the random twitching of dreams — deliberate, shaped, the mechanics of speech operating without the consciousness to authorize them. Sounds first, then syllables, then words.

"...tried before..."

I leaned closer. Not because I needed to — I could hear a sparrow's heartbeat at fifty meters — but because the words had texture. Weight. Something beneath them pressing upward.

"...the stopping never worked..."

My hands went still on my knees.

"...she kept going back. Every time. She said she wouldn't and she did and she did and she—"

He trailed off. His face was smooth — no distress, no nightmare. Just a boy talking in his sleep about things no thirteen-year-old should know.

Something tightened at the back of my throat. A taste — metallic, wrong, like biting into iron. The floor tilted a fraction of a degree. My vision smeared at the edges, and for a breath the hut wasn't quite the hut, the walls not quite where walls should be.

Then it passed.

I sat still. Three seconds. Five. Hands on my knees, fingers pressing crescents into skin.

He murmured something else — softer, dissolving before it found coherence.

Then silence. His breathing settled into the third-step pattern — four, two, six — steady reconstruction.

I unclenched my hands. Checked his pulse — steady, warm, ordinary. Pulled the blanket straight where his turning had bunched it.

The wind shifted. The grey light didn't change.

I went back to watching him breathe.

He woke up two hours later.

His eyes opened and the world shifted.

Not metaphorically — his eyes were different. The same brown, the same shape, the same stubborn architecture of a face that I'd been watching for months. But behind them, now, something moved. Qi, present and visible, a shimmer like heat above summer stone. Not constant — flickering. Irregular. The signature of channels that were full for the first time and hadn't yet learned what full felt like.

He blinked. Looked at the ceiling. Looked at his hands. Raised them, turned them over, examined his palms as if they belonged to someone else and he was trying to decide whether to keep them.

"What happened to me?"

His voice was rough. Four days of silence had dried it.

"You lived."

"That's not an answer."

"Yes it is."

He sat up. Slowly — testing whether his body would cooperate. It cooperated — reluctantly, stiffly, but it cooperated. He swung his legs off the mat, placed his feet on the floor, pushed himself upright.

And stood.

His mother woke up. Saw him standing. Made a sound — not a word, not quite a cry. Relief and fear in the same breath, neither willing to yield.

Wei looked at her. Looked at me. His jaw was harder than I remembered. Not physically — the bone structure hadn't changed in four days. But something behind his face had tightened. Set. Grief, or knowledge, or both — locked in.

"I feel..." He searched for the word. Couldn't find it.

"Different," I said.

"Yes."

He walked to the door. Opened it. The morning light hit him and he stood there, framed in the doorway, a boy who had been carried inside unconscious and was now standing in sunlight that he could probably feel differently than he'd ever felt it before — the qi in the air, the energy in the light, the subtle vibration of a world that had always been there and that he was now equipped to perceive.

Then he stopped. The animation drained from his posture. He went still — perfectly, completely still — and his hands began to shake.

Not weakness. Overpressure. Qi that was pushing through channels that were wide enough to carry it and strong enough to hold it but new enough that the flow hadn't smoothed into routine. Energy looking for an exit. Finding his hands.

He looked down. Made fists. The shaking stopped. He released them — back.

He looked at me.

"Is this normal?"

"It'll get better."

I didn't know if that was true.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [CRITICAL]: Meta-moment no longer decoded by Yun. Removed all analysis paragraphs (framework categorization, pattern recognition, self-aware lie acknowledgment). Replaced with pure physical response — checking pulse, straightening blanket, returning to watch. Yun experiences the wrongness (vertigo, metallic taste, spatial distortion) but does NOT analyze or comprehend it. Complies with Rule #40 (meta never solves) and #36 (involuntary only).
- Fixed [HIGH→MED]: Removed analytical framing from post-meta stillness ("the body's refusal to move when the mind has been struck by something it cannot immediately place") — replaced with sensory-only detail (crescents in skin).
- Applied Global Patterns: Eliminated 3× "the [N] of someone who" relative-clause constructions (line 27 analytical clause, line 59 "careful movements of someone testing," line 63 "something between the two that mothers produce when," line 65 "The way grief or knowledge or both settle into").
- Action upgrades: None needed — second half already event-driven.
- Continuity fixes: No foreknowledge violations found (Wei's sleep-talk is presented without Yun interpreting WHO "she" refers to).
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: Compressing the Gedanken-Echo reaction from 17 lines of introspection to 9 lines of physical response tightens E:R ratio and makes the meta-moment land harder through restraint.
