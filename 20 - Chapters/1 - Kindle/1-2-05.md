The mushroom was a Caltharia mimic.

It looked like Mingwort — the cap had the right color, the right size, the same preference for growing at the base of ash trees where the soil stayed damp. From two meters away, or through the eyes of someone who had learned botany from trial and error and the unreliable counsel of a village elder whose expertise peaked at "don't eat the red ones," it was indistinguishable from the real thing.

It was not the real thing.

Wei held it up. Proud. The pride of a hunter returning with a kill, except the kill was a fungus, and the hunter was a twelve-year-old with dirt under his fingernails and a grin that could power a small city.

"This one," he said, "is for the fever. I remember — you said the ones near ash trees are the good ones."

I had never said that. I had walked past an ash tree once and paused to examine the Mingwort growing at its base, and he had interpreted the pause as instruction. Which, I supposed, it was. Unintentional instruction was still instruction, the way an unintentional fire was still a fire.

"That's poison."

The word landed in the clearing the way a stone lands in a pond: a single point of impact, followed by concentric circles of silence that rippled outward until they reached the edges of everything.

Wei's grin didn't fall. It froze — caught between expressions, the way a face gets caught between languages. His hand stayed raised, the mushroom held between thumb and forefinger, its cap still catching the afternoon light.

"What?"

"Caltharia. Not Mingwort. The mimicry is strong — same color, same growth pattern, same substrate preference. The difference is the margin." I pointed, without standing, without moving anything except my finger. "Smooth. Mingwort is serrated."

He turned the mushroom slowly. Examined the edge. It was, indeed, smooth — a gentle curve where serrations should have been, like a saw with its teeth filed down.

"Your father would have stopped coughing within three hours."

Pause.

"Because he would have stopped breathing."

The mushroom descended. Slowly, the way things descend when the hand holding them has stopped receiving instructions from a brain that is busy elsewhere. He set it on the rock. Delicately, as if it might detonate.

He looked at the rest of his collection. Spread across the flat stone, arranged in the careful piles he'd built over the past hour. His eyes moved from specimen to specimen with a new quality — the quality of someone walking through a familiar room after learning that one of the floorboards has been replaced with a trapdoor.

"Have I—" His voice was thin. "Has my father already—"

"No. This variety grows only in the deep forest, past the third ridge. The specimens near the village are the harmless variant. Different soil acidity." I paused. "Harmless and useless are not the same thing, but in your case, they have been the same thing."

He breathed out. The exhale lasted longer than it should have — all the air leaving him at once, as if his lungs had been holding their breath for the duration of the sentence and were only now confident that the world was not ending.

"Show me the difference."

Not *please*. Not *can you*. Not *would you mind*. The imperative, bare and direct, stripped of everything that wasn't essential. The grammar of a child who had learned that politeness was a luxury and survival was not.

I stood up.

The motion surprised me — not the standing, which was mechanically trivial, but the decision behind it. I had not decided to stand. My body had made the choice without consulting the committee of indifference, detachment, and four thousand years of carefully maintained apathy that typically governed my actions. I was standing before the objections could be filed.

I walked to the stone. Picked up the Caltharia. Turned it over.

"Margin. Smooth means death. Serrated means life. It's that simple."

I set it down. Picked up a genuine Mingwort from his collection — the one correct specimen among twenty wrong ones, chosen, I suspected, entirely by accident.

"This is Mingwort. The real one. Feel the edge."

He touched it. Ran his finger along the cap's rim. His brow furrowed.

"Okay. That's—yeah. Bumpy."

"Serrated."

"Serrated. Right."

I picked up another specimen. "This is Whitestem. You've been collecting it for two weeks. It does nothing. It's a garnish. Your father has been drinking garnish tea."

"He said it tasted better than the last batch."

"It would. It tastes like very mild lettuce."

I set the Whitestem down. Moved to the next. "Bitter Root. Medicinal, but not for lungs. For stomach parasites. Unless your father has stomach parasites, this is irrelevant."

"Does he have stomach parasites?"

"I don't know. Does he?"

"I don't think so?"

"Then this is irrelevant."

The lesson — which was not a lesson, which was simply me correcting errors I could no longer tolerate — continued for what might have been an hour. I did not sit down again. I moved through his collection with the systematic disdain of a librarian sorting through a box of donated books, dividing them into categories: useful, useless, dangerous, and *how did you even find this*.

He absorbed everything. Not with the passive acceptance of a student, but with the active, almost aggressive focus of someone building a wall against a flood. Each correction was a brick. Each identification was mortar. His hands moved faster than his mind, arranging and rearranging, and when his mind caught up, it demanded more.

"What about that purple one? The one with the spotted cap?"

"Decorative. You could dry it and sell it at the market. You cannot use it for medicine."

"And the long one? The root?"

"That's a root."

"I know it's a root. What kind of root?"

"The kind you pull out of the ground and bring to me as if it means something."

He grinned. The grin was back — not the same grin, not the one that had frozen when I'd said *poison*. This one was smaller, sharper, with an edge that hadn't been there before. The grin of someone who had received a gift and recognized it as such, even though the gift had been wrapped in contempt and delivered with the warmth of a glacier.

The sun moved. The shadows rotated. The pile of discarded specimens grew. The pile of useful ones stayed small — five, perhaps six, out of thirty. He studied the difference. Asked again. I corrected. He asked again. I corrected again. The pattern established itself with the relentless efficiency of erosion.

I was not teaching him. I was preventing him from killing someone through ignorance. There was a difference. A vast, meaningful difference that I could articulate clearly and defend logically and that I did not believe for a single moment.

"Same time tomorrow?" he asked, when the light had gone orange and the shadows had merged into a single, undifferentiated dusk.

I said nothing. I walked away.

He took this as yes.

He was not wrong.
