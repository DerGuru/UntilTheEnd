Night. Forest. Fire.

Wei poked the fire with a green stick. The fire objected to the moisture through smoke.

"The boy," he said.

"What boy?"

"From the inn. The one with the broken core."

"What about him?"

"Who was he?"

"Nobody."

Wei looked at me. Through the fire. Through the careful architecture of the answer.

"You looked at him," Wei said.

"I look at many people."

"No, you don't."

True.

"He was a cultivator," I said. The minimum.

"I know he was a cultivator. His channels were visible to anyone above Foundation Establishment." Wei set the stick down. "He was the one who stopped the sky. Wasn't he?"

"What makes you think that?"

"His qi-signature. It matched the scar pattern in the cliff stone. Three weeks ago. The blast mark that felt like lightning and regret."

Lightning and regret. Wei's taxonomy. His classification system for qi-signatures, developed independently, expressed in poetry rather than technical nomenclature, more accurate for the imprecision.

"Yes," I said. Because the lie would have been too large. He'd done the work and the work was correct.

"He tried to ascend and it broke him."

"Yes."

"And he found us."

"He found us."

Wei was quiet. The fire cracked. Sparks rose — orange, brief, aspiring to height their fuel couldn't sustain.

"Who was he? Before?"

"Before what?"

"Before the breaking."

"A prodigy. The strongest of his generation. Core Formation in his twenties."

"And now?"

"Now he walks and pays with fragments."

Silence.

"He said the tremor gets worse. Then it breaks."

"He said that."

"You didn't correct him."

"There's nothing to correct."

Wei looked at me. Long.

"You always say 'nobody,'" he said. "Whenever I ask. 'Nobody.' 'No one.' 'Just a traveler.' 'Just a merchant.' 'Sleep.'" He listed them. My deflections. Catalogued. Indexed. Presented in sequence — not a pattern like weather but a pattern like policy.

"I don't believe you anymore."

Not loud. Low. Steady. A conclusion reached through process rather than emotion. Not an opinion — a finding.

*Feststellung.*

"Wei—"

"I'm not asking you to tell me. I'm telling you I know you're not."

He lay down. Turned toward the fire. Pulled his blanket up. Done with the saying. Not resolution — tabling. An item on an agenda to be revisited at a time not of my choosing.

I sat. The fire burned down. The forest performed its nighttime operations.

*I don't believe you anymore.*

The sentence sat in me. The weight of something that had been coming since the first lie and that had arrived not with drama but with the inevitability of a season.

The fire went out. I didn't relight it.

Wei breathed. Sleep or its imitation.

I sat in the dark.

You sat in darker rooms. I remember. Different dark. Same weight.

It was a long night.
