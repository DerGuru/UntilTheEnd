Spring arrived without asking permission.

Blossoms. White, pink, an assertive yellow that bordered on confrontational. The air warm, sudden. Birds reclaiming territory they'd abandoned months ago, vocal about the inconvenience.

Wei stood on the road. Pack on his back. Face tilted up. Eyes closed.

"Spring," he said.

I saw the blossoms. Saw through them.

We walked. The road was wider here — the northwest pass, well-maintained. Trees on both sides. New green. Cart tracks in the mud from a merchant caravan, the ruts still holding rainwater.

"How far to the next town?" Wei asked.

"Two days. Maybe less, if the road holds."

He nodded. Kicked a stone. Watched it skip ahead and vanish into the grass.

I had noticed it at dawn.

The bandage.

Wei's left forearm, wrapped in cloth and herbs, tied with a knot I'd taught him in the second week of travel. Applied not by me but by himself. Alone. In the dark. Before he thought I was awake.

I saw the bandage. Said nothing. Waited for him to mention it.

He didn't.

He walked. Spring-bright. Smiling at the blossoms. His left arm angled slightly — favoring the wound.

A creek ran alongside the road for half a li, clear and shallow over pale stones. Wei crouched at its edge and splashed water on his face. Wiped it with his good arm.

"Cold," he said. Grinning.

"It's snowmelt."

"Still cold." He shook his hand dry and stood. Droplets caught the light.

The road climbed. Gradually, then with intent. The trees thinned — cedar giving way to birch, white trunks against the hillside. We passed a stone marker, the characters worn smooth by centuries of weather. Something about a temple. Or a toll. The distinction had blurred.

"Your arm," I said. Three hours into the walk.

He glanced at it. "Caught it on a branch. Last night."

A lie. Small. Clinical. Delivered in the tone I recognized because I had invented it.

"Let me look at it."

"It's fine."

"Wei."

"It's fine, Yun."

I didn't push.

A bird — gray, fat, indignant — burst from the underbrush ahead. Wei flinched. Then laughed at himself.

"Thought it was a spirit beast," he said.

"It was a pigeon."

"A very aggressive pigeon."

We walked. Spring continued its project. The road curved toward the mountains — gray, distant, the patience of things that measured time in epochs. Wind carried pine resin and wet earth.

Wei walked ahead of me. By three steps. Then five. Then seven.

The distance grew.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [CRITICAL]: E:R ratio restructured from ~10:90 to ~80:20. Cut 6 paragraphs of post-show bandage analysis (guilt spiral, "absence of disclosure," "this was my fault" cascade, "pushing would have required" chain) down to zero — the showing (bandage detail, body language, lie delivery) now stands alone.
- Fixed [CRITICAL]: Part 7 opening restructured around external events. Added creek scene, road-climbing landscape passage, merchant cart tracks, stone marker, pigeon encounter — external content now drives 60%+ of chapter.
- Fixed [HIGH]: Dialog desert eliminated. Added 3 new dialog exchanges distributed throughout (town distance, creek/snowmelt, pigeon/spirit beast) so no stretch exceeds ~150 words without a spoken line.
- Fixed [HIGH]: "the [N] of" constructions reduced from 5+ to 1 ("the patience of things") by cutting analytical paragraphs that contained most instances.
- Fixed [HIGH]: Yun voice recovered from pure anxiety-analysis. Dry humor restored via pigeon exchange and snowmelt line; observational register via landscape details.
- Applied Global Patterns: Show-don't-tell (bandage detail kept, analysis deleted), dialog-breaks-introspection (Rule 32), SoL-as-foundation (creek, road, bird — Rule 31), sparse dialog tags (Rule 116).
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: Cutting the six-paragraph guilt analysis after the bandage reveal lets the reader feel the weight of Wei's silence instead of being told what it means.
