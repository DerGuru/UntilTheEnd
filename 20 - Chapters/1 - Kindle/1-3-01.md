The birds stopped singing on a day that should have been ordinary.

I noticed because I had been counting their songs — not consciously, not the way a naturalist counts species, but the way an ear that has listened to forests for four thousand years notices when the orchestra goes quiet mid-measure. The sparrows stopped first. Then the finches. Then the thrush that had nested in the dead oak a quarter-mile north, the one whose predecessors I'd been tracking across generations like a genealogy written in melody.

By mid-morning, the forest was silent.

Not peaceful silent. Not the contemplative hush of a forest between rains, or the reverent quiet that followed snowfall. This was the silence of evacuation — the sound of ten thousand small lives deciding, simultaneously and without consultation, that being elsewhere was now a priority.

Wei noticed.

He was at the river, sitting on his stone, eyes closed, in the middle of the breathing exercise I'd taught him three weeks ago. His posture had improved — back straighter, weight centered, hands resting rather than gripping. He was supposed to be listening to the water, filtering the river's voice from the background noise of the forest until each sound existed as a distinct, identifiable thread.

His eyes opened.

"It's too quiet."

Four words. Said with the careful precision of someone reporting a fact they wished they could unrepeat. His head was tilted — that listening angle, the one I'd trained into him through repetition and correction until it became reflex. He was hearing the absence.

I was sitting on the bank. Had been for an hour, watching the fog and thinking about nothing, which was the only form of meditation that still worked for someone who had long since exhausted every other form. The fog moved over the water in slow, purposeless currents, carrying the scent of mud and cold stone and the faint metallic edge that arrived when qi shifted underground.

That metallic edge. That was the important part.

"Where are the birds?" Wei stood. Slowly, as if sudden motion might attract whatever had silenced the forest. He looked at the canopy, the underbrush, the water. Everything was still. The kind of still that isn't restful but held — taut, like a string about to be plucked.

I felt it before I heard it. A pressure change — subtle, happening miles away, propagating through the earth's qi network the way a tremor propagates through water. Not an earthquake. Nothing so crude. This was cultivation pressure: the signature of someone drawing massive amounts of ambient qi through their meridians, fast enough and hard enough that the surrounding environment dimmed like a lamp with an opened valve.

I knew what it was. I had seen it a hundred times across a hundred centuries: a cultivator hunting spirit beast cores for a breakthrough. Absorbing, consuming, climbing — blind to everything below and behind them, focused on the single point of light above that they called ascension and that the world beneath them called catastrophe.

The trees would feel it first. Then the plants. Then the water sources. Then the animals, who were smarter than humans in this regard — they didn't need to understand qi theory to know when the ground was being drained. They ran. That was the silence Wei was hearing: the sound of an ecosystem flinching.

"What's wrong with the forest?" he asked.

I stood up. Brushed my hands against my sides — another meaningless gesture, a pantomime of physicality that I maintained out of habit. The fog continued its drift. The river continued its murmur. But underneath both, the metallic edge sharpened.

"Something's hunting," I said.

"Spirit beast?"

"No."

He waited for elaboration. I did not provide it. He was learning — slowly, imperfectly — that my silence after a statement was not an invitation to ask follow-up questions, but a wall behind which additional information existed and was not being served.

"Should we—"

"Collect your herbs closer to the village."

He looked at me. Opened his mouth. Closed it. Looked at the forest — the silent, waiting, emptied forest — and then at the path that led back toward smoke and noise and the fragile, temporary safety of human proximity.

"Okay," he said.

He picked up his basket. Paused. Turned back.

"You're not coming?"

"No."

He waited a beat. Two. Then he walked. His footsteps receded through the undergrowth — loud as always, but this time the loudness felt different. Not careless. Brave. The sound of a small thing moving through a world that had gone quiet for reasons too large for it to fight.

I stood by the river and listened to the silence. Miles away, northwest, deep in the old-growth forest where the trees were thick enough to predate human memory, the pressure pulsed again. Rhythmic. Hungry. Growing.

Fourteen days. Perhaps less.

The animals were right to run.
