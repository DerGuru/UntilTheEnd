I left before dawn.

No explanation. No note. No instructions for Wei beyond what I'd already given — continue the third-step pattern, filter the water, stay close to the village. He would wake up, find my spot empty, and either worry or not. I was betting on not. He'd learned, over the past weeks, that I went where I went and came back when I came back and the interval between departure and return was not an invitation for anxiety.

The work took all day.

I walked the valley in concentric circles — starting at the village center, expanding outward in rings, reading the terrain the way a doctor reads a body: here, the flow is healthy; here, it's congested; here, it's dying. Qi followed grade and stone the way water did — pooling, channeling, stalling — and this valley's body was ordinary: alluvial plain, granite ridges north and east, the river running southwest, underground streams feeding the water table. I'd seen a thousand valleys like it.

I'd also seen what happened to them when a cultivator broke through nearby.

The qi-flow was already compromised. Xu Ran's consolidation was pulling energy from the northeast, creating a gradient — high pressure at his position, low pressure everywhere else. The valley was draining toward him like bathwater toward a plughole. Natural qi channels that had been stable for centuries were reversing. Underground streams were carrying contaminated water south. The trees on the eastern ridge were dying first because they sat on the primary line.

I couldn't stop the drainage. Not without using my own qi, which was not an option. But I could redirect the worst of it.

Geology first. I found the pressure points — places where the qi-flow could be diverted with minimal physical intervention. A ridge of granite, exposed by erosion, acting as a natural dam. A dried creek bed, its channel still viable if I could force a new path into it. A cluster of boulders on the hillside above the village, positioned almost perfectly to deflect the flow if I shifted two of them by three meters each.

From that slope, I could see the village as a smudge of smoke and roofs. Small. Warm. Fragile. Wei would be there, doing what I told him, trusting that my leaving was not abandonment. If the well turned bitter, it wouldn't be theory. It would be thirst.

I shifted the boulders. By hand. One was large enough that a normal woman would have needed a lever or a team. I rolled it with my shoulder, my feet braced against the slope, the physics of leverage and friction doing the work that qi would have done faster and cleaner. My hands were bleeding by the second boulder. I hadn't bled in centuries.

The creek bed took more effort. I dug — a trench, two feet deep, running along the natural contour of the hillside, connecting the dried channel to the river.

The first section slumped as soon as I cleared it. Dry soil, hollowed by drought and undermined by the altered flow — it didn't hold its shape. It folded back into itself with a soft collapse that felt, irrationally, like mockery.

I stood there for a moment, evaluating.

Make it shallower and risk it failing at the moment it mattered. Or lose the hour and do it again.

I dug it again. Wider this time. With a lower lip on the downhill side, stones pressed into the packed earth as ribs. When the qi-flow hit the redirected granite barrier, it would follow the path of least resistance — down the trench, into the river, and out of the valley. Away from the village. Away from the well.

It wouldn't stop the drainage. But it would redirect enough of it — forty percent, maybe fifty. The difference between a poisoned well and a cloudy one. The difference between a dead harvest and a poor one.

The stone walls took the afternoon. I built them at three points along the valley's eastern edge — not walls in the architectural sense, but barriers. Low, thick assemblies of flat stones stacked with the precision of someone who understood how qi behaves when it meets mineral density. I gathered the stone from the slopes, carried it down, and stacked it with hands that were raw and dirty and human.

The paths were last. Subtle work — shifting stones along existing trails, bending branches to create new sight lines, adjusting the landscape's geometry in ways that no human eye would notice but that a spirit beast's qi-sense would register as direction. When Xu Ran's breakthrough came, the qi-shockwave would drive every spirit beast in the area into panic. They'd run. Without guidance, they'd run in all directions, some of them through the village. With my adjustments, the paths of least resistance led away — south, toward the river, into the open plain beyond.

No qi. No cultivation. No power.

Knowledge. Observation. Four thousand years of watching valleys die and noting which ones didn't and asking why.

I came back at dusk. Wei was by the fire. He looked at my hands — split, dirty, the knuckles swollen — and said nothing. He looked at the dirt on my clothes, the scratches on my forearms, the general evidence of a day spent doing physical labor that had nothing to do with cultivation and everything to do with the kind of effort that leaves marks.

He handed me the water filter. Three layers — sand, gravel, charcoal — exactly as I'd described. The water that came through was clear. Not perfect, but clear.

"Dinner?" he asked.

"You cooked?"

"Rice. And something green."

"Something green."

"I don't know the name. It wasn't poison. I checked — serrated edges, not smooth."

He'd remembered the caltharia lesson. I almost said something that might have been mistaken for approval. Instead, I took the bowl he offered and sat by the fire and ate something green that wasn't poison, and the rice was overcooked and the green thing was bitter, and it was fine.

My hands hurt. I hadn't noticed until I stopped using them. The blisters were forming already — white, tender, absurd on fingers that could have reshaped the valley with a thought.

"You were building something," Wei said. Not a question.

"Yes."

"Can I see it tomorrow?"

"Try," I said.

He smiled. The kind of smile that meant he was already planning his route.

I flexed my hands under the firelight, watching the blisters catch the glow, and thought about granite deflection angles and limestone absorption rates and the precise distance between a young cultivator's breakthrough and a village's survival.

Two weeks. Maybe less.

The barriers would hold. They had to hold. Because the alternative was a power I'd buried so deep that even thinking about it felt like reaching into a grave.
