No rooster.

That was the first thing. The absence of Mrs. Zhao's rooster — that stubborn, opinionated, chronically inaccurate timekeeper. Its dawn performance had been the village's most reliable (if least appreciated) alarm for as long as anyone could remember. The rooster was silent. Not sleeping, not late — silent. Pressed into the corner of its coop with its head tucked under its wing and its body motionless and its usual combative posture reduced to something small and tight and afraid.

The birds were gone. Not migrated, not hiding — gone. The trees were empty. The bushes were empty. The eaves and the rooftops and the fence posts where sparrows gathered every morning to argue about territory were bare. The sky was bare. Nothing moving in it. Nothing crossing it. A blue so absolute and uninterrupted that it looked manufactured, like a ceiling painted by someone who'd never seen weather.

The wind had stopped.

Not slowed — stopped. The leaves on the few remaining trees hung motionless, each one suspended at the exact angle where the last gust had left it. The flags on Elder Li's house — two faded cloth strips that usually reported wind direction to anyone who cared — drooped. The dust that had been the valley's constant companion for weeks settled and stayed settled. The air was heavy. Warm. Thick. It sat in the lungs like something solid, requiring effort to breathe, as though the atmosphere itself had gained weight overnight.

The silence was the wrong kind.

Not quiet. Silence. The distinction matters. Quiet is the absence of loud sounds — the natural state of early morning, when the large noises haven't started and the small ones are working up to their full volume. Silence is the absence of all sound, including the ones you don't notice until they're gone: the wind in the grass, the creak of warm wood, the constant, subliminal hum of insects that forms the background on which every other sound is painted.

That background was gone. The canvas was blank. The world was a room with the door closed and the air stopped and every surface padded and every creature holding its breath because something, somewhere, was about to happen that made breathing feel impolite.

I stood in the clearing. The qi-pressure was absolute.

Not the grinding, building pressure of the past weeks — the incremental tightening that had crept up day by day. This was final. Complete. The qi-density in the air had reached a level where sound waves couldn't propagate normally, where the medium itself was too saturated to carry vibration. The silence wasn't atmospheric. It was physical. The qi was suppressing sound the way water suppresses fire — by filling the space it needed to exist in.

Xu Ran was ready.

I could feel him. Five hundred meters northwest. A single point of impossible density, compressed past the limits that physics had set and cultivation had overridden. He was holding himself at the threshold — the final breath before the final step, the last moment of being what he was before he became what he would be.

Hours. Maybe less.

Wei was awake. He stood in the doorway of the hut, barefoot, rigid — a body receiving information his mind hadn't processed yet. His qi-sensitivity — second-step, refined through months of training — was registering the pressure as a sensation he had no framework for: weight without weight, loudness without sound, threat without source.

He looked at me.

I looked at him.

"Today?" His voice was thin in the pressurized air. The word barely carried.

"Yes."

"How long?"

"Hours. Maybe less."

He swallowed. His hands balled at his sides — not fists, not fear, just a boy's body holding itself steady when the air pressed down.

"The bundles," he said. Not a question.

"The bundles."

He turned. Walked into the village. Within two minutes, his voice — thin, pitched too high, breaking through the silence like a stick breaking through ice — cut through the space between the houses.

"Bundles. South slope. Now."

No arguments. No discussions. No Gao objecting about boats. The village had been living in the shadow of this moment for weeks, and the shadow had taught them something that arguments couldn't: preparation is the dividend that fear pays when it's invested correctly.

They moved. Practiced, smooth, the choreography of a community that had rehearsed its own salvation. The bundles were at the doors. The children were gathered.

"Mei, hold your brother's hand. Don't let go." Mrs. Liu's voice was steady. The kind of steady that costs something.

"The chickens —" someone started.

"Leave them," Elder Li said. He was already moving, Mrs. Liu at his arm — the familiar configuration, his stubbornness and her patience locked in a partnership that neither acknowledged and both relied on.

Fifteen minutes. The village was empty.

I watched them go. South. Down the path Wei had chosen, along the route I'd cleared, over the terrain I'd secured. Twenty-three people moving away from a danger they couldn't see and couldn't fight and understood only as weight and silence and the wrongness of a sky without birds.

Wei was at the front. Leading.

"Stay together," he called back. "Watch your step past the rocks."

"We know the rocks, boy," Gao muttered. But he watched his step.

Wei's back was straight and his hands were steady and his face, when he turned once to make sure everyone was following, was the face I'd seen in firelight and moonlight and the dawn of a day when the well went dry — older than twelve, younger than any age that would justify what he was doing, exactly as old as he needed to be.

He turned again. Looked for me.

I was not at the gathering point. I was at the tree line. East. Moving toward the forest, toward the pressure, toward the point where the silence was thickest and the air was heaviest and the physics of what was about to happen were concentrated into a space the size of a clearing.

"YUN!" His voice. Distant. Thin in the suppressed air. "Yun, where are you going?"

I didn't turn around. The answer would have been too long, and the truth too heavy, and the air too thick for either.

"YUN!"

I kept walking. Into the trees. Into the pressure. Toward the thing that was about to happen, because someone had to be there when it did.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Added 4 dialog exchanges (Wei/Yun "Today?" confirmation, Mrs. Liu/Elder Li during evacuation, Gao/Wei at the rocks, expanded YUN! into two-beat call with question)
- Applied Global Patterns: GP-03 — broke "whose dawn performance" chain (line 5 → period + "Its"), rewrote "someone whose body is receiving" (line 29 → direct description)
- Replaced wordless eye-exchange with spoken dialog — stronger Part 7 opening that still preserves urgency
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The "Mei, hold your brother's hand" / "The chickens—" / "Leave them" exchange during evacuation grounds the abstract qi-pressure in human cost.
