Three days.

Three days since the wave. Three days since I'd pressed my hands against his chest and felt the architecture of his channels reshape under my fingers. Three days since the village had watched me do it — watched me crouch over a boy and pour something into him that had no name they could use and no explanation I would offer.

Three days since I'd become something other than the herb collector on the hill.

Wei hadn't woken up.

He was sleeping — not unconscious, not damaged, not dying. Sleeping. The deep, borderless sleep of a body rebuilding itself from the foundations up, each breath a measured construction project that his nervous system was executing without his input or consent. His channels were wider than they'd been. Stronger. The qi flowing through them had settled into a rhythm that matched his heartbeat, four counts in, two held, six out, the third-step pattern I'd drilled into him over weeks of repetition now running like a second pulse.

Under his skin, at his wrists and temples, the faint glow had finally faded. Gone. The channels were stable. The restructuring was complete. All that remained was the waking.

I sat beside him. On the floor. On the mat. In the hut that still smelled like ash and dried herbs and the mineral tang of dispersed qi that hadn't quite dissolved into the ambient background.

I waited.

I don't wait. That's not — it's not something I do. Four thousand years of existing had refined my relationship with time into something functional: I moved through it, or it moved through me, and either way I didn't sit in one place and watch a boy breathe and count the intervals between his inhales and measure the depth of his exhales against a standard I'd established three weeks ago when he was a stubborn twelve-year-old who couldn't hold a Qi-breathing count past four.

He was thirteen now. His birthday had passed somewhere in the crisis — during the drought, or the tribulation preparation, or the days when everyone was too busy surviving to count dates. I hadn't noticed. He hadn't mentioned it.

The lie tasted familiar.

His mother sat in the corner. She'd been there since the healing — since I'd pulled my hands back and the glowing lines had faded and the boy had shifted from unconscious to sleeping. She hadn't left. Hadn't eaten, as far as I could tell. Her hands were in her lap, folded tight, knuckles white, stillness chosen because the alternatives were worse.

She didn't look at me.

She looked at her son. At his face. At his breathing. At the steady, rhythmic rise and fall of his chest that meant alive and safe and changed in ways she couldn't understand and didn't need to.

Her pulse was too fast at her throat. Her breathing shallow. Every few minutes her eyes flicked toward me — quick, involuntary — then back to Wei.

Not afraid of him. Afraid of me.

On the second night, Wei's qi had spiked — a single pulse, sharp enough to rattle the clay cups on the shelf.

His mother had gasped. I'd already moved. Hand on his forehead, channels mapped, the spike traced and smoothed before the cups stopped rocking.

She was on her feet, halfway across the room. "What's happening to him?"

"Growing pains." I pulled my hand back. "The channels are settling. Like a river finding a new bed."

"That — that is not what rivers do to my son."

She had a point. I didn't say so.

Wei slept on. Undisturbed. The glow at his wrists pulsed once, faintly, then stilled.

Outside, the village was quiet. The wrong kind of quiet.

Doors closed. Windows shuttered. The paths around my hut — once traversed by children and the occasional chicken — empty.

Elder Li had come to the door twice. I'd felt his footsteps — measured, deliberate, the gait of a man assembling courage. Both times, he'd stopped three meters away. Stood there. Then turned and walked back.

The third time, he made it to the threshold.

"How is the boy?"

His voice was steady enough. His hands weren't.

"Sleeping."

"And when he wakes?"

"He'll be different."

Elder Li stood there for a moment longer. The silence between us carried everything he wanted to ask and nothing he dared to. Then he nodded — once, tight — and left.

I sat. Watched Wei breathe. Counted the intervals.

Waited.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH] E:R ~20:80: Added external event — Wei's qi spike on second night (cups rattling, channel fluctuation, Yun intervening physically).
- Fixed [HIGH] Zero additional dialog: Added 3-line exchange between Yun and Wei's mother during the qi-spike event. Mother's voice: protective, sharp, grounded. Yun: terse, deflecting.
- Fixed [MED] Post-show analysis: Cut the "fear" analysis paragraph (told emotion → replaced with physical details: pulse, breathing, eye-flick). Cut the village-quiet interpretation ("not the natural silence… but the deliberate, constructed silence") — let "the wrong kind of quiet" stand alone.
- Applied Global Patterns: Sparse dialog tags (action-beats replace tags); subtext over statement (mother's fear shown through her body, not named); retrospective + physical detail rule (qi spike anchored in clay cups, glow at wrists).
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The qi-spike event breaks the chapter's introspective weight in its center, gives the mother agency through dialog instead of passive observation, and makes the three-day wait feel lived-in rather than narrated.
