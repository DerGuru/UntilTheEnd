Wei's mother brought me congee.

She came in the late morning, when the sun was high enough to warm the clearing but not high enough to bleach it. She walked with the careful, deliberate gait of someone carrying something that weighed almost nothing and mattered enormously. The bowl was ceramic — the same one Wei had used, with the chip on the rim that I recognized the way I recognized constellations: as a fixed point in a shifting sky.

The congee was thin. Rice, water, a few pieces of ginger sliced so thin they were translucent. Steam rose from the surface in delicate spirals that the morning air tore apart and reassembled. It was, by any objective measure, the poorest kind of food that a poor household could produce — the culinary equivalent of a prayer offered with no expectation of being heard.

She set the bowl on the rock beside me. The same rock. The flat one where Wei sorted his herbs, where the Caltharia mimic had sat before I'd told him it was poison, where a thousand small negotiations between life and death had been conducted in the language of leaves and stems.

She didn't speak. Didn't look at me. Didn't perform the elaborate choreography of gratitude that I'd seen in a hundred thousand variations across every culture the world had ever produced. She simply set the bowl down, nodded once — a movement so small it could have been attributed to the breeze — and walked back toward the village.

Her hands, at her sides, were still cracked. Still swollen. Still the hands of a woman who washed other people's clothes because her own family couldn't afford to feed itself without the supplemental income of labor that destroyed her body one joint at a time.

She had taken her portion of rice — the portion she would not eat tonight, the portion that represented the caloric deficit she would carry into tomorrow's labor — and given it to me.

I looked at the bowl.

The ginger floated in the congee like small, pale moons. The steam thinned as the morning warmed, the temperature differential decreasing until the surface was barely misting. The rice had been cooked long enough to dissolve into the water, creating a porridge that was more texture than substance, more hope than nutrition.

I had not eaten in centuries. Eating was for the finite. I was not finite. I was something that went on past the point where *going on* had any meaning.

I picked up the bowl.

The ceramic was warm. Not hot — the temperature of something that had traveled twelve minutes in the hands of a thin woman walking at the pace of kindness. The weight was negligible. The contents were negligible. Everything about this object was negligible except the fact that it existed, and that its existence had been directed at me.

The congee was unnecessary. The gesture was not.

I drank.

The taste was — I searched for a word. Simple was too cold. Warm was too physical. The taste was a handshake. An introduction between my body and a world I had been observing from the other side of a window for so long that I had forgotten windows could be opened.

The ginger was sharp. The rice was soft. The water was warm.

That was not food. That was an argument.

And the argument was:

*Stay.*

---

I sat with the empty bowl for a long time after. The clearing was quiet with the kind of quiet that follows a decision: not silence, but settlement. The rearrangement of particles after a tremor, the world finding its new equilibrium and discovering, with neither surprise nor complaint, that the new position was slightly different from the old one.

The old position: I am here because I have not left.

The new position: I am here.

The difference was a single word — *because* removed, and with it, the escape hatch, the conditional, the deniability.

Here.

For the boy who ran like a disaster and fell like a punchline and got up like a theorem.

For the mother with the cracked hands and the rice she couldn't spare.

For the father who smiled through blood because his son was watching.

For the village that was fragile and stubborn and temporary and *right there*, ten minutes' walk from a forest that was eating itself from the inside, in the shadow of a cultivator who was climbing toward a power that would scatter them like ash.

I stayed.

Not *I will stay* — a future tense implies planning. Not *I have decided to stay* — a statement implies deliberation. I simply — stayed. You probably saw this coming before I did.

I set the bowl down. Ceramic against stone. A small, definite sound.

The ginger aftertaste lingered.
