He found me behind the inn.

Night. The alley was narrow — stone walls, drainage, conversations that didn't want witnesses. The moon was half.

I'd known he would come. His damaged perception had been grinding against my absence all evening. He'd figured it out during dinner — fragments aligning, his gaze landing on me and not sliding off because his damage let him see what his intact perception would have filtered.

Four meters. Close enough to talk. Far enough to run, though running was optimistic given his body and mine.

He was upright. The posture was costing him. But upright. Deliberately. The statement: *I am not kneeling.*

"I know what you are."

"Do you."

"The woman who stopped the sky. The one I've been—" He stopped. Swallowed. "—looking for."

I said nothing.

"What are you?"

Wind. The half-moon traced its path.

I looked at him. The young man who had tried to reach Immortal and been struck down and spent months paying for me with pieces of himself and who was standing here with a cracked core and steady hands.

He didn't kneel. His legs trembled with the effort. But he stood. Because standing was the last thing he had.

"I don't know."

The wind shifted. My shoulders dropped — a fraction, a release I hadn't permitted in decades.

Xu Ran waited. Minutes.

"Why?" he asked.

"Why what?"

"Why didn't you kill me?"

"Why would I?"

"I threatened your village."

"It wasn't my village."

It was.

He looked at me. Heard the lie. Chose not to challenge it.

"I'll find you again," he said.

"Many have said that."

"I'm not one of them."

He turned. Walked away — unsteady, wavering, a body that had spent its last reserves on standing upright. He walked to the corner. Turned. Disappeared.

I stood. Alone. In the half-dark. With a question I'd answered honestly for the first time in centuries, still hanging in the air.

The honesty hadn't helped. It never does.

I went back inside.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [CRITICAL]: Duplicate dialog ("I'll find you again" / "Many have said that" / "I'm not one of them") — KEPT here in Ch56 (strongest placement: first confrontation, Xu Ran standing despite broken core, maximum emotional stakes). Ch60 instance rewritten with fresh dialog.
- Fixed [HIGH]: Post-"I don't know" analysis (was ~3 sentences of existential over-explanation) → replaced with 1 sentence of physical reaction (wind, shoulders dropping). Scene now breathes.
- Applied Global Patterns: Reduced 3× "the [N] of" constructions ("the gradual alignment of" → "fragments aligning", "the state of his body" → "his body", "the waver of a body" → "wavering", "the echo of a question" → restructured).
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: Cutting the post-"I don't know" analysis lets Xu Ran's silence do the work — the minutes he waits now land harder because the reader waits with him.
