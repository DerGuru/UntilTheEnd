The forest smelled like rain that hadn't fallen yet.

I walked. That was what I did — walked. Through forests, across mountains, along rivers that had changed their courses three or four times since I'd first seen them. This one was old, for a forest. The trees were thick enough that two men couldn't have wrapped their arms around most of them, and the canopy was so dense that morning came late and left early. Moss draped the branches in soft curtains. Ferns unfurled from rotting stumps. The air was heavy, green, and wet.

It was beautiful. I knew that the way you know a fact you've read too many times — with your head, not with anything that matters. Though looking back, I think my body knew it better than I did. Bodies are stubborn that way.

Another day.

I stepped over a fallen trunk without looking down. My feet knew the ground better than my eyes did. A thousand forests, ten thousand — they all had the same bones underneath. Roots, rocks, the slow decay of things that used to stand. I could feel the qi in the soil, dim and sluggish, the pulse of a world that didn't know I was listening.

Birds called from somewhere above. A warbler, two sparrows arguing over something that mattered deeply to sparrows and to nobody else, something larger rustling through the upper branches. Insects hummed in the spaces between the trees, that low drone that filled the silence without breaking it. The sound of a forest that was alive, unremarkably, persistently alive.

I'd heard these sounds when the trees were saplings. Before that, when the land was scrub. Before that — but I didn't think about before that. Not on mornings like this. Not when the light came through the leaves in patterns I'd memorized ages ago.

A branch caught at my sleeve. I pulled free without looking — the fabric tore, a small sound, almost apologetic. The robe was old enough that it had opinions about branches. I kept walking. The torn thread dangled against my wrist, and I tucked it into the seam from habit, the way you mend things that don't need mending because your hands need something to do.

My feet were bare. The moss was cool and damp. Dew clung to the fern tips and occasionally one would brush my ankle, leaving a cold streak on my skin that was — not unpleasant. That was the word I allowed. Not pleasant, not meaningful. Not unpleasant. The temperature of water on skin, the texture of moss between toes. Small things. I still registered small things. I just didn't know what to do with them anymore.

I passed a spirit beast den — empty, recently abandoned. The scratches on the entrance log were fresh, the dirt still damp where something large had dragged itself out. Low-level. Tier one, maybe two. The kind of beast that would terrify a village and bore a proper cultivator. I noted it the way you note a crack in the road: something that existed, that I would step around.

At the base of the den, a clutch of crushed eggshells — white, paper-thin, already half-reclaimed by the soil. Something had hatched here and left. Whatever it was, it was too small to be a threat and too new to be afraid. I stepped past. The shells crunched under my heel.

The air shifted. Warmer, suddenly, as if the forest had taken a breath. A cloud must have moved — sunlight broke through the canopy and hit the ground in a column of gold, illuminating the motes of dust and pollen that drifted through the air like tiny, purposeless travelers.

I stopped without meaning to.

The light was warm on my face. I closed my eyes.

For a moment — half a moment, maybe less — I let it sit there. The warmth. The quiet. The smell of moss and wet wood and the faint sweetness of wild jasmine — I could have named every flowering thing in this forest if I'd cared to, and some part of me still did, the part that had once kept a garden. I pushed that down. It went easily. It always did.

Then I opened my eyes and kept walking.

The morning light caught on a spiderweb strung between two branches — each droplet of dew a tiny, perfect lens. I'd seen something like it before, once, on a mountain that no longer existed. The web had been bigger then. Or maybe I was remembering it wrong. Memory did that after a few thousand years. The details softened, the edges blurred, until what remained was less a recollection than a feeling wearing the costume of one. You'd think it gets easier — the forgetting. It doesn't. It just gets quieter.

A mushroom cluster grew from the base of a rotting oak — pale, fat caps in a neat row, their undersides dark with spores. Edible. Good, even. The kind a village herbalist would trade a day's work for. I looked at them for three steps longer than I needed to, then turned away. I hadn't eaten in — how long? A month? Three? The body didn't need it. Hadn't needed it for so long that the act of eating felt like a performance. I could eat. I remembered how. I remembered enjoying it, distantly, the way you remember the plot of a story someone told you once at a party.

My qi was still. Perfectly masked. That took no effort — hadn't for millennia. Like breathing, like blinking. The ocean pretending to be a puddle. Anything in this forest with the sense to feel for energy signatures would register me as nothing. A mortal woman walking through the trees. Unremarkable. Forgettable.

That was the point.

I followed no path. There wasn't one, not really — just the gaps between the trees that were wide enough to walk through without turning sideways. The forest floor dropped slightly, following the slope of a hill I'd watched erode over the centuries. At the bottom, a stream — thin, clear, gurgling over stones that had been sharp once and were smooth now. A kingfisher sat on a stone in the middle of the current, its feathers absurdly blue against the grey water. It watched me step across. I watched it back. Neither of us blinked. I liked kingfishers. That was one of the small admissions I still allowed myself — not affection, just a preference. A quiet partiality for things that were patient and precise and didn't ask anything of anyone.

The kingfisher dove. The splash was barely a sound. When it surfaced, a minnow flashed silver in its beak.

Something caught at the edge of my awareness.

A qi signature — low, animal, pulsing with hunger. Spirit beast. Close. Maybe three hundred paces north, moving south through the undergrowth. Its energy was ragged, agitated. Hunting, or fleeing from something that hunted it. The feel of it was coarse, like rough-cut stone — no refinement, no cultivation, just raw power compressed into muscle and bone and instinct.

I logged it and kept walking. Spirit beasts were common enough in forests like this. The qi concentration in the soil attracted them. They fed, grew, sometimes evolved. Sometimes they wandered into the lowlands and destroyed a village. Sometimes a cultivator came and destroyed them first. The cycle was old and unremarkable. I'd seen it turn a thousand times.

Then I felt the second signal.

Small. Human. Faint. The qi signature of someone who had never cultivated a day in their life — just the dim, natural glow of a living body. A child, probably. Young. Moving through the forest maybe a hundred and fifty paces east of my position, perpendicular to the beast's trajectory.

I stopped.

The beast was heading south. The human was heading west. Their paths would intersect in — I calculated without thinking, the way I calculated everything without thinking — sixty heartbeats. Maybe seventy, if the child was slow. Which children usually were.

I stood very still and listened to the forest breathe around me.

Later, I'd tell myself that the pause meant nothing. I was good at telling myself things.

The kingfisher called from the stream behind me — two sharp notes, like a question it didn't expect answered.

Something in the air felt a fraction out of place.

The way I always did.
