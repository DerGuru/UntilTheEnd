Wei moved before I did.

The Bear's hand was rising — the third gesture, the third demonstration, the systematic escalation of a man whose protocol dictated that resistance was met with pressure and pressure was increased in increments.

He never found the threshold.

Wei jumped.

Not strategically. Not technically. Not with the footwork I'd taught him or any trace of the training I'd invested months in. He jumped the way a child jumps — with everything, all at once, total commitment with complete disregard for consequence.

His qi exploded.

The enabling effect detonated. His entire output, amplified by my stream, concentrated into his fist. Moving toward the Bear's chest with the velocity of free fall and the force of a body channeling four thousand years of second-hand power through thirteen years of bone and muscle and will.

Contact.

His fist hit the Bear's sternum. A thirteen-year-old Foundation Establishment cultivator striking a Dao-Seeking elder.

The Bear went back. One step. His rear foot grinding a furrow in packed earth. His qi-field destabilizing for a fraction of a second — a fraction that, in combat calculus between cultivators, was an eternity. His eyes widened. Not pain — impossibility. The blow hadn't hurt him. But it had *moved* him.

Stillness.

Then the Bear responded.

Not with words. With the direct counterattack of a Dao-Seeking cultivator who had been touched by an insect and whose reflexes executed before his rationality could intervene.

A wall of energy. Wei flew. Ten meters. One second at the Bear's chest, the next airborne.

He hit a tree. The sound — crk. Not one clean break but the muffled, multiple sound of several things going wrong at once. Ribs. Maybe his arm.

Blood. From his mouth. Bright, oxygenated red from internal sources.

His core flared. Visible through his clothing, through the blood. Beautiful and terrifying — the edge of tolerance, tipping.

Forty-seven percent screamed in my head. His current saturation was at—

Not yet. Close.

I moved.

A breath.

Not a technique. Not a deployment of qi. A single exhalation — the simplest function of a body that breathed, that had been breathing for four thousand years without it being notable.

This one was.

The breath carried a fraction. A whisper of the total. A single drop carrying the ocean's salinity — proportionally identical, volumetrically negligible, sufficient to demonstrate what the whole contained.

The trees bent. Not from wind — from pressure. The ground cracked — not hairline fractures but deep, structural, bedrock meeting something it couldn't absorb.

The Bear knelt.

Not deliberately. He knelt because his body stopped consulting his will. His knees met the earth with the sound of impact — a man whose physical form had decided, independently of his consciousness, that standing was no longer an option.

His qi-field folded. Compressed. Reduced from room-filling presence to a fraction, packed tight within his body.

A sound.

Glass. Breaking. Less than a whisper. Something fracturing at a level of reality that shouldn't produce sound and did anyway. Nobody else heard it.

I heard it.

*Like glass.*

I filed it. Let it go.

"Leave," I said.

The Bear left. His body carried him away while his mind processed what had happened.

I went to Wei.

He looked up. Blood on his chin. In his teeth. The grin — impossible, irrational. A boy broken against a tree by a force that exceeded his comprehension, and his first reaction was joy.

"I hit him."

I knelt beside him. Hand on his chest. Felt the damage — two ribs cracked, one bruised. Left arm, deep tissue. Nothing that wouldn't heal with qi and time.

His core pulsed against my palm. Too fast. Too hot. The signature of a core that had been redlined — and the fuel keeping it elevated was flowing from my hand into his chest in the same gesture that was healing his bones.

Cure and disease. Same hand. Same motion.

"I hit him." Quieter. The grin fading into something softer — pain and pride and confusion and trust, all at once.

"You did."

"He was strong."

"Yes."

"Stronger than me."

"Yes."

"But I hit him."

"Yes."

He closed his eyes. Let me work. The complete surrender of his body to my hands, of his core to my qi, of his safety to the woman whose proximity was the thing putting him in danger.

Trust is always violent. It just disguises itself as stillness.
