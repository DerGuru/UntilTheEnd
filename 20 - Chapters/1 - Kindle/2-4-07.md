Wei knew something had changed.

He didn't know what. But he knew. The non-cognitive recognition of a shift in the person he'd been walking beside for months.

It happened on the second day after the failed suppression.

We walked. The hills had flattened into rolling terrain — farmland in theory, abandoned in practice. Fields gone to seed. Stone walls half-collapsed. The occasional foundation of a building that no longer existed above the level of its own ambition.

Wei walked beside me. Closer than usual — the proximity that tightened when he sensed something.

He stopped.

Not walking. Training. He stopped the cultivation cycle mid-breath. Stood still. The vertical line between his eyebrows — the one that appeared when he was processing something without vocabulary.

He looked at his hands. Turned them over. Palm up, palm down.

Then he looked at me.

"Yun?"

"What?"

He opened his mouth. Closed it. Opened it again.

"Nothing."

He turned. Resumed walking.

I let him.

The road bent south around a collapsed grain shed. Roof beams jutted from the wreckage like broken ribs. Wei kicked a shard of roof tile, watched it skitter across packed dirt.

"Was this a village?"

"Once."

"What happened?"

"People left. Buildings didn't."

He nodded once, the way he did when he was filing something away for later.

We walked through the afternoon. The terrain gave us a stream — real water, cold, running between the abandoned fields. Wei knelt. Drank. Washed his face.

"My hands feel different."

I waited.

"Heavier. Like they're — full of something."

"Your channels are developing."

"Is that what it is?"

"That's what it is."

Half-truth. His channels were developing. Because I was developing them.

I filled the waterskin while he sat on the bank, flexing his fingers open and closed. The water ran cold enough to numb — deep-rock water, not runoff.

"Can you feel yours?" he asked. "Your channels."

"Not the way you mean."

"What way, then?"

"The way you feel your skeleton. You know it's there. You don't think about it."

He frowned. "That sounds boring."

"It is."

By the time the light turned amber, we'd found a spot — flat ground between two low walls, sheltered enough. Wei gathered wood without being asked. Stop, perimeter, fire, water — he'd learned the pattern months ago. Routine as safety. He was good at that.

I set wards. He arranged kindling. Neither of us spoke.

"Yun."

"What."

"You look tired."

"I don't get tired."

"You look like someone who doesn't get tired and is tired anyway."

I almost laughed. The almost lived in my throat for a second and dissolved.

The fire caught. Wei fed it a branch, then another. Sparks rose and vanished against the darkening sky.

"The hands thing," he said. "It's not bad, is it?"

"No."

"Just different."

"Just different."

He accepted that. Lay back against his pack and watched the sky lose its color, one shade at a time.

By evening, the vertical line between his eyebrows had faded. But the question hadn't. It sat between us — quiet, patient, keeping pace.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [CRITICAL] E:R ratio: Shifted from ~3:97 to ~60:40 by adding external events (collapsed grain shed, stream/waterskin, camp setup, firemaking) while preserving all original action and dialog beats.
- Fixed [CRITICAL] Post-"Nothing" analysis: Deleted both analysis paragraphs ("*Nothing.* The word that meant…" and "His trust made the lie easier…"). Replaced with "I let him." — silence speaks.
- Fixed [CRITICAL] 97% reflection: Cut introspective bulk, added three SoL scenes (ruined village, waterskin at stream, camp/fire). Chapter now *does* things.
- Fixed [CRITICAL] Dialog count: Added 3 new exchanges (ruined village Q&A, channels/skeleton exchange, fireside "hands thing" callback) for 6 total exchanges, 26+ dialog lines.
- Fixed [HIGH] "the [N] of" reduction: Removed "The stream — my stream, the one made of qi and guilt" over-definition line. Avoided pattern in new prose.
- Applied Global Patterns: Dialog breaks introspection (Rule 32); SoL scenes do work — Wei's routine = character development, channel questions = worldbuilding (Rule 38); physical detail anchors every beat (Rule 39).
- Action upgrades: Camp setup sequence (wood gathering, wards, kindling) shows Wei's learned competence. Waterskin filling gives Yun physical action during reflection beat.
- Continuity fixes: "Failed suppression" reference maintained (ch36 bridge). Abandoned farmland terrain consistent with ch38's river/child encounter. Wei's channel development tracks qi-flood consequence.
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The fireside callback ("The hands thing — it's not bad, is it?" / "Just different." / "Just different.") gives the chapter an emotional landing that the original's closing reflection tried to provide through analysis — now delivered through dialog and echo instead.
