*He wants to touch the sky.*

The words were gone. But the echo wasn't. Echoes don't carry content — they carry shape, and the shape of those words hung in my chest the way a bruise hangs in muscle: invisible, persistent, aching when you move the wrong way.

I sat by the fire that night. Wei was in the village, helping repair a wall that had cracked in the latest tremor — the third this week, each one slightly stronger than the last, each one met with slightly less surprise and slightly more resignation. The fire was low. I hadn't bothered building it up. The warmth wasn't the point. The light was the point, and the light was barely enough to see my own hands, which was exactly the right amount.

A pot clanged somewhere below. A voice snapped a name. Then the village noise settled back into its careful, measured rhythm — the kind people adopt when fear is too expensive to indulge.

*He wants to touch the sky.*

I knew someone like that. Once.

The wind tonight carried dust and a faint metallic tang that sat on the back of the tongue. The same register of wrongness. A different hilltop. A different valley. A different millennium.

But the same hunger.

Not a boy. A man — barely. Twenty-two, maybe twenty-three. His name was — I had to reach for it. Sift through layers of faces and places and names that had accumulated like sediment, each one pressing the ones beneath it deeper into the inaccessible geology of memory. His name was irrelevant. What mattered was what he was: brilliant, young, consuming, certain. A cultivator at the edge of something vast, pulling everything around him into the gravity of his ambition.

I'd watched him for three years. Not intervening. Not participating. Observing. He'd been interesting the way natural disasters are interesting — beautiful and terrible and utterly indifferent to their own consequences.

The civilization.

Not a village. Not a city. A civilization. A culture that had taken a thousand years to build — layer upon layer of art and architecture and philosophy and music, assembled by generations of people who believed that what they made would outlast them.

I'd walked those streets. The sandstone glowed golden in late afternoon light — a quality of gold that I've never seen anywhere else, warm and alive, as though the stone itself was breathing. The libraries smelled of cedar and old ink; it clung to the inside of the nose long after you left. There were gardens on the rooftops. Fruit trees in ceramic pots. Flowering vines climbing trellises that the wind played like instruments.

Children chased each other between the planters. Old women drank tea and watched the sun go down behind the mountains. Ordinary life, built on the assumption that the walls would stay where walls belonged.

The cultivator — the prodigy — he built his cultivation in a cave fourteen li from the city walls. Away from people, which was responsible. Not far enough away, which was mathematics.

His breakthrough came at dawn. I felt it first as a humming in my bones — a frequency that started low and climbed, rapidly, past the range of hearing and into the range of feeling, the kind of vibration that turns solid objects into liquid and liquid into air. The qi-wave expanded from his cave in a perfect sphere, invisible and absolute, the boundary between before and after moving outward at the speed of something that didn't care what it crossed.

Ninety li. The wave extended ninety li.

The sandstone walls cracked first. Clean, precise fractures running through the golden stone like sentences through a page. The walls didn't fall — not immediately. They cracked, held, trembled, and then settled into their new geometry: broken but standing.

The libraries burned. Not from fire — from saturation. The scrolls, dense with centuries of ink and thought, absorbed the wave's energy until their structure couldn't hold the charge and converted it to heat. Spontaneous combustion. Scrolls that had survived floods and wars turned to ash in seconds, the words on them briefly visible as the paper darkened — a moment of absolute clarity, every character sharp and legible, and then gone.

The gardens died in the time it takes to blink. The fruit trees curled inward, their leaves browning and falling as the qi pulled every particle of moisture from their cells. The flowering vines turned black. The trellises, suddenly unburdened, swayed in the shockwave's wind and then stood still.

The wave didn't stop at one impact. It rolled outward, flattened, reflected off the mountains, returned weaker but persistent, oscillating through the city until the structures that had only cracked began to fail.

The children ran. Most of them. Some didn't. I won't describe those. Restraint isn't mercy; it's triage.

The survivors crawled from the wreckage. They rebuilt. They always rebuild — that's the terrible, resilient, infuriating thing about people. They stacked broken sandstone into lower, uglier walls. They cleared the library ruins and didn't replace them because the knowledge was gone and you can't replace what you can't remember. Nobody planted new rooftop gardens.

The cultivator — radiant, transcendent — rose from his cave and flew. He lifted above the valley, above the mountains, above the smoke.

He didn't look down.

They never look down. You'd think that would stop being surprising. It doesn't.

A tremor ran through the ground beneath me. Present tense. Firelight jumped. For a moment I could smell baked earth instead of memory.

I was on a hilltop. Like this one. The wind was the same — warm, dry, carrying dust. Below me, the ruins smoked. A child — five, maybe six — stood in what had been a library, holding a burned scroll. She wasn't crying because she could read it. She was crying because something enormous had been taken from the world and her body knew it even if her mind didn't.

I could have stopped it. The breakthrough, the wave, the burning, all of it. I could have contained the expansion with a thought. Less than a thought — a reflex, the way you catch a glass before it hits the floor.

But then I would have been part of it.

Observing was easier. It was always easier.

So I stayed on the hill until the smoke thinned.

And then I walked away.

Wei came back late. I heard his steps before I saw him. He paused by the fire as if he meant to speak, saw my face, and decided not to. He set a cracked tile down beside the stones like an offering to a god he didn't believe in, and went to sleep.

I fed the fire once. Not for warmth — for light.
