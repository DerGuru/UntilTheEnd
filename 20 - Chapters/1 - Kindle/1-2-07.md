The river was slow that morning. Fog lay over its surface like a second skin, moving in currents that had nothing to do with the water underneath. The banks were soft with mud and the brand of moss that grew where freshwater met shade, producing a green so dark it looked like it was holding its breath.

Wei was sitting on a stone.

His posture was a child's attempt at patience — straight-backed, legs crossed, hands on his knees, every muscle holding still while the rest of him screamed against it. His left foot twitched. His right hand made small, involuntary adjustments to the fabric of his trousers. A muscle in his jaw pulsed with the effort of not speaking.

He had been waiting when I arrived. I didn't know how early he'd come. The dew on his shoulders suggested before dawn. The fact that he'd said nothing when he saw me suggested something closer to desperation.

I stood at the river's edge. The water moved over stones that had been here longer than the village, longer than the forest, longer than anything in this valley except me. The fog drifted against my ankles and didn't care.

I could walk away. I had walked away from better reasons than this — from burnt cities, from broken covenants, from students who had shown more promise than this boy could dream of. Walking away was what I did. It was, in some ways, the only thing I did with genuine competence.

"Sit still."

The words came out before the decision arrived. My voice — low, flat, uninflected — speaking to a boy who hadn't asked a question, issuing an instruction I hadn't planned to give.

Wei blinked.

"Don't speak. Don't move. Sit still."

He froze mid-blink. Then adjusted: unclenched his jaw, settled his shoulders, aligned his spine — not quite right, too rigid, holding the posture with effort rather than finding it — and closed his eyes.

"Listen."

"To what?"

"I said don't speak."

He closed his mouth.

The fog drifted. The river murmured its permanent, unhurried monologue. Somewhere in the canopy, a bird measured the silence and decided not to break it. I listened to his heartbeat — fast at first, the rhythm of anticipation, then gradually slowing as the stillness took hold and his body accepted that nothing dramatic was about to happen.

Fourteen seconds passed.

"How long do I—"

"Longer."

He swallowed the rest of the question. His foot twitched once, twice, then stilled. His breathing deepened — not through technique, but through the natural mechanics of a body finding its resting state when the mind stops interfering. The fog moved around him without touching him, which was ordinary physics and not qi, but the effect was pleasing.

Minutes passed. Five. Ten. The morning light strengthened, burning through the fog in slow, spectral columns that shifted as the sun moved. His face relaxed. The furrow between his eyebrows — the one I hadn't noticed forming over the past weeks, the crease of a child carrying responsibilities that belonged to adults three times his age — softened. His hands unclenched. His breathing found a rhythm that matched the river.

"What do you hear?" I asked.

"The water. Birds. Wind in the leaves." His voice was slower than usual. Quieter. As if the stillness had entered through his ears and settled in his throat.

"What else?"

He listened. The concentration was visible — not in tension, but in the quality of attention that animals show when they sense something they can't name. His head tilted, the way a dog's tilts, following a frequency below the threshold of conscious recognition.

"Something..." He hesitated. "In the ground. Not a sound exactly. More like... humming? Very low. Very far away."

He hadn't opened his eyes. His face was turned slightly downward, toward the stone beneath him, as if he could hear through his knees.

I said nothing.

He was right. The qi currents that ran through the valley's bedrock — residual flows, old as the mountains, too faint for most cultivators below Foundation Establishment to detect — hummed at a frequency that was felt more than heard. For a boy with no training, no meridian cultivation, no qi sensitivity beyond what nature provided, to perceive even a shadow of that current was — 

I stopped the thought. Stopped it clean — hand out before the reason arrives. *Remarkable* was a word I had stopped using. Remarkable led to investment, investment led to attachment, and attachment—

He sat on the stone. Cross-legged. Head tilted. Hands on his knees. The posture was wrong — back not straight enough, weight distributed unevenly, chin too far forward. But the shape of it. The silhouette against the morning fog, backlit by a sun that hadn't fully committed to the day.

Someone else had sat like that.

The memory came without permission, the way memories do when they've been buried improperly — not deep enough, not in the right soil, with roots still connected to the surface.

A different river. Wider. Colder. The water had been grey, carrying snowmelt from mountains that no longer existed. Herbs laid out on the bank — the right ones, because I had taught him which were which, and he had listened the way Wei listened: with his whole body, leaning in, absorbing each word through skin and breath and the form of attention that isn't learned but born.

His hands had been larger than Wei's. Calloused differently — not from farm work, but from years of grinding herbs with a stone mortar that he'd carried everywhere. He had learned quickly. Not talented — diligent. There is a difference, and the difference matters.

He had asked questions that made me stop. Not often — but when he did, the questions went deeper than they had any right to, past the surface of botany into the architecture of the world itself. *Why does this root heal and that one kill, when they grow in the same soil?* I had started to take his questions seriously. That was the mistake. Not because the questions were wrong, but because taking someone seriously meant turning toward them, and turning toward someone meant that when they were gone—

A bird cut across the fog. Blue and fast. It vanished into the reeds, leaving the air trembling.

In the memory, the herbs were still on the bank. Brown and brittle, curling at the edges, left exactly where he'd placed them.

*And one day the herbs had withered and he was gone.*

I blinked. The river in front of me was brown, not grey. The boy on the stone was small, not tall. The fog was lifting, not falling, and the mountains were still here.

"You okay?"

The question was soft. He'd opened his eyes. He was looking at me with an expression that had no business being on the face of a twelve-year-old — not concern exactly, but something adjacent. Awareness. The quiet recognition that the woman in front of him had gone somewhere else for a moment, and that wherever she'd gone, it had not been a pleasant visit.

I brushed my knees. Stood up. A human gesture — unnecessary for me. Every human gesture was unnecessary for me. I kept making them anyway.

"Enough for today."

He looked at the sky. "That was half an hour."

"And?"

He opened his mouth. Closed it. Considered. Then nodded, with the restraint of someone who understood that pushing right now would break something.

He stood. Picked up his basket. Turned toward the path that led back to the village, and then stopped, and said:

"Same time tomorrow?"

I did not answer. He left.

The river moved over its stones. The fog finished lifting. The morning arrived in full, bringing light and warmth and the ordinary business of a world that did not know, and would not care, that something old had just remembered something older.

I stayed by the river for a long time.
