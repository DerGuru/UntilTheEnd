I arrived at the camp to find it empty.

Not abandoned — organized. The bundles were stacked. The fire pits were covered. The blankets were folded and tied with the specific knot that Mrs. Liu used for everything from grain sacks to goat tethers. The camp hadn't been evacuated — it had been *concluded.*

They were already heading home.

I found them on the path — the southern route, my southern route, the one I'd cleared and reinforced and marked with turned stones and shifted branches. Twenty-three people walking north in a line that was orderly without being regimented, the spacing natural, the pace calibrated to the slowest member (Mrs. Zhao, whose shoulder was in a sling and whose pace was the pace of a woman who wanted everyone to know that the sling was optional and her compliance was a temporary concession to physics).

Wei was at the front.

He'd woken them at dawn — before the shockwave, I realized. Before the tremor, before the pressure wave, before the single tile that fell from a building none of them were inside. He'd felt it coming. The qi-sensitivity I'd built into his training — the third-step pattern, the foot-reading, the awareness of ambient pressure — had alerted him the way a barometer alerts a sailor. He'd felt the change, identified the direction, estimated the timeline, and made the call.

"Pack up. We're going home."

He'd said it with the authority of someone who'd already done the calculation and reached the conclusion and wasn't interested in discussing alternatives. Elder Li had looked at him — the old man's face doing the recalculation it had been doing since the village square — and nodded. Chen stood up. Gao stood up. Mrs. Liu folded blankets. The machinery of the community engaged, and the boy at its center wasn't pushing it or pulling it — he was simply facing the right direction and walking.

I fell in at the back of the line.

A child glanced over his shoulder, saw me, then looked away as if looking cost something he couldn't afford. Mrs. Liu's gaze flicked once — to my hands, to my face — and moved on. Elder Li did not turn fully. He didn't need to. The angle of his head changed by a degree, acknowledgment without ceremony.

No one said anything. They made space anyway.

The village was damaged. Not destroyed — the distinction I'd been maintaining since the barriers went up, the distinction between repair and restoration, between surviving and living. Two more tiles had fallen. The fence — rebuilt twice, reinforced once, source of ongoing philosophical debate about the structural integrity of recycled lumber — was down again. A window in Elder Li's house had cracked. Dust everywhere. The ever-present, drought-amplified dust that converted every event into a cloud and every cloud into a coating.

But the walls stood. The houses stood. The grain shed held. The water containers were intact, and the stream — fed by the spring that Wei had found and the channel I'd widened — was running clearer than it had in weeks.

Clearer.

I paused. Tested the water. The qi-contamination had dropped. Sharply. Xu Ran's breakthrough had released the accumulated pressure — the siphon effect that had been draining the valley's qi for weeks was gone. He'd broken through. He didn't need the valley's energy anymore. The drain had stopped.

The well would recover. Not immediately — the mineral contamination would take weeks to flush. Maybe longer, depending on what the shock had stirred up.

But it would recover. The fields would rehydrate. The trees on the eastern ridge would stop dropping leaves. The ecosystem would heal, the way ecosystems do when the parasite departs and the host remembers how to function.

I watched the village recognize this. Not all at once — recognition in a community is a slow, distributed process that moves through the population like weather. Mrs. Liu tasted the stream water first. Her face changed — not dramatically, not a smile, but an easing of the tension around her eyes that had been there for so long it had become architectural. She said nothing. She didn't need to. Chen tasted it next. Then Elder Li. Then the children, who didn't understand water quality but understood that the adults had relaxed, and the relaxation of adults is the most reliable signal of safety that children know.

Wei stood in the village center. The same spot where he'd stood up and said "we do this." He looked around. At the fallen tiles and the broken fence and the dust and the cracked window. At the standing walls and the intact roof and the grain shed and the stream.

He nodded.

Not at anyone. Not for approval. The nod of someone who'd done the best he could with what he had and was cataloging the results without judgment — noting what held, what fell, what needed repair, what could wait. The nod of a leader who'd finished his first campaign and was older for it.

I stood at the edge of the village. My usual position. The periphery, the margin, the space between belonging and observing. My hands were in my pockets — a gesture I hadn't made in centuries, the kind of unconscious self-containment that bodies perform when they don't know what else to do with themselves.

"He's learned it," I said quietly.

The words hung in the air. Simple. True. Insufficient.

He'd learned it. Not just the water routes and the rationing and the evacuation logistics. He'd learned to stand up when others sat down and make decisions when others argued and carry weight that was too heavy and then put it down and then pick it back up.

He'd learned it.

Good.

A pause.

He'd need it.
