The shrine sat in a fold of the mountain like something the land had tried to swallow and given up on. Half the roof was gone. Vines choked whatever was left, thick as rope, cracking through stone that had once been carved with care. The path leading up to it had no path anymore — just a suggestion where mud was thinner between the trees.

Xu Ran stopped at the base and looked at his shoes.

"These were new," he said.

I didn't answer. I was already climbing.

The air changed the moment I crossed the threshold. Not the temperature — something else. A pressure behind the ears that had nothing to do with altitude. The qi here moved wrong. Not stagnant, not absent — skewed. Like water running uphill in a stream that looked perfectly still.

I knelt by the entrance wall and pressed my palm flat against the stone. The surface was cold. Not mountain-cold, which makes sense in autumn. Cold the way metal is cold — the kind that drinks warmth out of your skin and gives nothing back. Old fittings lined the doorframe, brackets for a gate long gone, and every one of them felt like midwinter.

Chalk dust. I tasted it before I saw it — a grit between my teeth, fine and persistent, the residue of walls that had been grinding themselves to powder for centuries. I spat. It didn't help.

And underneath it all, faint as a thought you can't quite hold: incense. Musty. Sweet in the way rot can be sweet if you're far enough from it. No source. No burner, no ash, no stain on the stone. Ghost-smell. The kind that makes you turn your head and find nothing.

I wiped dust from the nearest relief panel with the heel of my hand. Slow, methodical strokes. Moos came away in clumps, revealing carved lines beneath — geometric, precise, the work of someone who had understood symmetry not as decoration but as language.

"You could use a brush," Xu Ran said from behind me. He'd made it up. His breathing was slightly uneven, which he covered by adjusting his collar.

"Could." I kept scraping. Fingernails into grooves. The stone spoke through texture — edges worn smooth here, still sharp there. Whoever had carved this had believed in what they were doing. You can always tell. Conviction leaves deeper marks than skill.

He wandered the perimeter while I worked. I heard him — boots on broken tile, the careful placement of someone testing each step before committing weight. He found a beam that had fallen at an angle and rested against the far wall, and he must have leaned on it, because the wood groaned.

"Careful."

"I'm being careful."

"The ceiling over you is held up by optimism."

He moved.

I worked the wall for the better part of an hour. Layer by layer. Dust, lichen, moss, more dust. The carvings underneath told me nothing I could read yet — not because the symbols were foreign, but because too many were missing. Time had eaten them the way time eats everything: patiently, starting at the edges.

But the qi. The qi was interesting.

It flowed toward me. Not along the natural channels in the stone — those ran east, following the mountain's spine, the way water follows gravity. This undercurrent pulled south. Toward me. When I moved to the next panel, it adjusted. When I stepped outside to check the foundation, it followed.

That wasn't normal. Qi doesn't track people. Qi settles, pools, flows — it does what geography and spiritual density tell it to do. It doesn't decide.

And old. Not shrine-old — older. The qi predated the stone it moved through, by centuries at least. Whatever had settled here had done so long before anyone thought to build walls around it.

I said nothing.

By noon, Xu Ran had managed to cut his hand on a splintered beam. Not badly — a shallow slice across the back of his left hand, the kind that bleeds more than it should because the skin there is thin. He held it out to me without asking, which was either trust or habit. Both irritated me equally.

I wrapped it. Clean cloth from my pack, wound tight, three loops and a tuck. I didn't look at his face while I did it. My hands knew what to do — they'd been doing it for longer than this shrine had existed, longer than the mountain it sat on had been called by its current name. The wrapping was precise, mechanical, the kind of care that has nothing personal in it.

He studied his bandaged hand the way you study a sentence that almost makes sense.

"Thank you," he said.

I was already back at the wall.

The afternoon brought wind. It came from the wrong direction — northwest instead of the usual east — and carried a smell of wet pine that didn't match the dry season. I noted it. Filed it away. Added it to the list that had started forming three days ago, when a riverbed we'd crossed had been six feet wider than my memory insisted it should be.

I wasn't keeping the list on paper. Not yet. Lists on paper can be found.

By evening, I'd cleared four panels. The carvings showed cultivation forms — body positions, qi flow indicators, the visual shorthand that sects used before written manuals became standard. Old work. Pre-Consolidated Era, probably. The stone was the right age.

Xu Ran built a fire in what might have been the shrine's inner courtyard. He was getting better at it — fewer attempts, less swearing. He set a pot over the flames and started cutting something that might have been a root vegetable into shapes that might have been intentional.

"Anything?" he asked.

"Nothing conclusive."

That was a lie. Or rather, it was the kind of truth that carries a lie inside it, the way a shell carries the sea. There was plenty. The qi flow was anomalous. The wind was wrong. The carvings felt — not familiar, exactly. But not unfamiliar either. Like a room you've never visited that has furniture arranged the way you would arrange it.

I sat across the fire from him and watched the flames find their rhythm. The chalk dust had settled into the lines of my palms. The cold metal taste lingered at the back of my throat.

He slid a bowl toward me. I ignored it for a while. Then I ate.

Mechanical. Tasteless. My jaw moved because that's what jaws do when food is placed between teeth. Xu Ran watched me eat the way a scholar watches an experiment — noting, not commenting. His notebook sat by his knee, closed.

"You're different," he said.

"How."

"In the Echoes — in the crater months. You were closed. Sealed. Like a door someone had nailed shut." He paused. Chose his words with the care of someone defusing something fragile. "Now you're open. But it's worse."

I looked at him.

"You're not grieving anymore," he said. "You're hunting."

I set down the bowl.

The fire popped. A spark rose and died. Somewhere in the dark beyond the broken walls, an owl called — the two-note cry of a species that shouldn't have been this far south.

I added it to the list.
