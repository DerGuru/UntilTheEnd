Morning. The cliff behind us. Eight hundred meters of vertical stone receding as we walked — or as I walked and he followed, the dynamic unchanged, the ten paces maintained, the gradient from brown to yellow to green holding its ecological commentary.

But the walking was different.

Not faster — the body walked at the same velocity it always walked. Not more purposeful — purpose was still emerging, still forming in the space the question had opened. The difference was: direction.

I chose left.

At a fork in the path — a natural fork, a real fork, not the product of frustration or impulse or the reality-editing the substrate performed — I chose left. Left because left led downhill and downhill led to the lowlands and the lowlands led to the regions where the investigation would begin.

I chose. The weighing of options, the assessment of outcomes, the selection of one over the other. Will. The old path to will — not repaired. Rewired, roughly. Something that was not quite will but close enough performed the function, and the performance was adequate if not elegant.

Xu Ran noticed the choice. The noticing was visible in his notebook — he wrote as he walked, the pen moving in the rhythm that said: *she chose. She chose left.*

He did not comment. He followed left.

The path descended. Through terrain that was terrain — trees, slope, the lowland transition that mountains produced when they stopped being mountains. A real path. Worn by other feet. Not mine. Not the substrate's. The world's.

The dust was on my robes. The fine grey particles from the cliff's base, the landing zone, the place where eight hundred meters of falling had concluded in floating and settling and standing. The dust was evidence. I had not cleaned it. The not-cleaning was: deliberate. The dust was the only physical evidence that the fall had happened and the fall was the thing that had changed everything and the everything-changed needed evidence.

I would investigate.

The thought was formed — not the impulse-before-thought, not the pre-verbal substrate-level event that preceded cognition. An actual thought. I would investigate what I was. I would find the places where I had survived things before — the old sites, the old falls, the old wounds, the old deaths-that-weren't-deaths. I would look for patterns. I would think.

The humming accompanied. Beneath the ribs. Low. The second breathing. Present the way my own breathing was present — constant, unremarkable, the background condition of being alive in the manner that I was alive.

The question accompanied. *What am I.* Not as weight — as compass. In the chest where the hand had pressed, in the space where the substrate had said *no*.

Xu Ran walked behind me. Ten paces. His notebook in his hand, the pen moving. His breathing accompanied — the slight elevation of rate that walking at elevation produced in a cultivator with a broken core.

We were two people walking away from a cliff. We looked like pilgrims. We were not pilgrims.

Behind us: eight hundred meters of the thing I had survived and the way I had survived it and the knowledge that survival was not mine.

Ahead: the lowlands. The investigation. The search for what I was.

The path descended. We descended with it. The distance from the cliff increased and the increasing was not away-from but toward — toward the next thing, the first step of the investigation.

The shift was done.

Not visible. The shift was internal — the difference between a compass that spun and a compass that pointed. The compass pointed in.

I walked. He followed. The humming continued. The gradient held. Two figures descending through mountain terrain toward the lowlands below.

Not healed. Not recovered. Not the narrative satisfaction of someone who emerged from darkness into light.

Moving. Toward a question. And from the question: the possibility of an answer.

The dust on my robes. The humming in my chest. The ten paces between me and the person who documented everything.

The cliff behind us. The answer ahead.

We walked.
