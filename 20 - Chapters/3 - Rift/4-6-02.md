The clearing was adequate.

Morning light arrived through the canopy gap — the kind of light that found open ground wherever trees had fallen. The clearing was forty paces across. Flat. Compacted earth, sparse grass. Good visibility. Good footing.

I stood in the center. Xu Ran stood at ten paces.

The phial was in my hand. Ceramic. Warm. The wax seal intact. The weight of two mouthfuls. Ninety seconds to dissolve immortality.

I looked at Xu Ran. He was holding his notebook — the first one, the personal one. The brush was wet. Weight forward, eyes moving — the posture of someone recording, not participating.

"Ready?" I asked.

He did not answer with a word. He raised the brush slightly.

I broke the seal. The wax crumbled. The phial was open.

"Absorption at fifteen seconds," Xu Ran said, eyes on the scroll spread across his knee. "Onset at thirty. Death at ninety."

I drank.

One motion. The phial to the lips. The tilt. The liquid — thin, the consistency of water, the temperature of ambient — entered my mouth and I swallowed and the ceramic was empty.

The clearing held its features. The light. The trees at thirty paces. Xu Ran at ten. The phial in my hand, empty.

I waited.

The cliff had been instantaneous — the fall was the threat, the response was the stop. But the poison was different. Internal, not external. Through the blood, not through gravity.

I waited.

Five seconds. I felt: nothing. The liquid was in my stomach. Efficient. Someone had put real craftsmanship into this.

Ten seconds.

Xu Ran's brush moved. He was writing. Fast. The shorthand of someone writing against a clock.

Fifteen seconds. The absorption should be complete.

Twenty seconds.

I felt it.

The onset was not what I expected. The scroll had described burning — the meridians responding to the compound's approach the way nerve endings responded to acid. Burning. Progressive. Peripheral to central.

What I felt was: cold.

Not the cold of temperature. The cold of absence. Something was being eaten. The Shadow-Eater was eating.

The peripheral channels.

I felt them go. The minor meridians in my fingers, my toes. One by one. Not pain — absence.

Twenty-five seconds.

"Fingers," I said. "The peripheral channels are dissolving."

Xu Ran wrote.

Thirty seconds. The secondary channels. The compound was progressing inward. On schedule.

I watched myself die. From the edges. Layer by layer. Channel by channel.

Cold. So cold.

The primary channels.

Thirty-five seconds. The large meridians. The load-bearing structure.

I felt it. The sensation of becoming: less.

Forty seconds.

The dantian.

The compound reached my core.

"Forty-five," Xu Ran said. His voice was wrong.

The Shadow-Eater began to eat.

And then —

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Cut 8 post-show analytical cascades — "gesture meant: proceed" reader-hand-holding, experiment-as-question 7-sentence analysis after "I waited," cold-as-absence 4-sentence metaphysical cascade, capillary-network definition, "flat/clinical" self-tone analysis, scroll-accuracy confirmation cascade, qi-structure removal analysis + "indistinguishable from self," dantian 3-line definition cascade, structural-failure analysis paragraph
- Added dialog: Xu Ran reads poison specs aloud (replaces narrator exposition); "Forty-five" countdown (shows his fear through voice, not narration)
- Applied Global Patterns: Compressed "the kind of X that Y" on morning light; removed em-dash over-definitions
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The countdown now accelerates instead of stalling — each timestamp hits harder without the 3-sentence analytical buffer between beats.
