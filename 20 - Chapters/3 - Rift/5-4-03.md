He said it again. Slower. Shorter. Each sentence weighted with the patience of a man who is trying very hard not to be angry at someone who doesn't deserve anger.

The anomalies are you. The qi signature is yours. Reality adjusts to your presence. The researchers who discovered this were erased. Something in you doesn't want you to know.

I listened. I understood. Again. The logic was flawless. The evidence was arranged in the sand — redrawn, simpler this time, his lines heavier, as if pressing harder might make the knowledge stick.

I nodded.

"Okay," I said.

"Okay?"

"Okay. I hear you. I understand."

His breath released. Not fully — he was watching me now the way you watch a candle in a draft, waiting for the flicker.

Two minutes.

That's how long it lasted. Two minutes of understanding, two minutes of clarity, two minutes during which I held the shape of the truth in my mind like water held in cupped hands — present, visible, undeniable, and slowly, inevitably, seeping through the cracks between my fingers.

The first thing to go was the connection between the anomalies and me. One moment it was clear — A causes B, as certain as gravity — and the next it was a proposition, a maybe, a thing someone had suggested that sounded plausible but wasn't quite...

Then the researchers. Six of them. Or had it been five? The scrolls said — what did the scrolls say? I could see them, there, in the firelight. They said something about qi obeying will. A phrase. Someone else's phrase. Important, but —

Then the spiral. The map. The tightening path. Xu Ran had shown me, and I'd seen the pattern, and now the pattern was — was it a pattern? Or was it coincidence? We'd walked south because south was where the ruins were, and ruins cluster in certain geological formations, and —

Gone.

Like a dream four minutes after waking. The contours remained — something important, something large, something that had filled the space behind my eyes with a pressure that meant truth — but the content had dissolved. Not all at once, this time. Piece by piece. A dismantling. Methodical.

I looked at Xu Ran.

His eyes were different. Angry. Not the irritation from before — something harder, held tight.

"How long?" I asked.

"Two minutes."

"Was it the same? What you said?"

"Word for word."

"And I —"

"Understood. Perfectly. Said 'okay.' Looked like you meant it." His voice was flat. Forcibly flat — the kind of control that costs something. "And then your eyes changed."

"Changed how?"

"Like someone lowering a wick. From behind your eyes. I watched the understanding leave your face, Yun. I watched it get TAKEN."

Silence.

The fire had burned lower. The scrolls lay in their rows. The sand drawings — his third set now, redrawn with less precision and more force — glowed in the dying light like a language being forgotten in real time.

"One more time," he said.

"Why?"

"Because." He stood. Found the stick — a new one, thinner, sharper. His movements had a quality of controlled urgency, the body language of someone who knows they're fighting something and has decided to fight harder rather than surrender. "Because this time I'm going to watch for it. I'm going to see the exact MOMENT it happens."

He said it a third time.

Not slower. Not gentler. Harder. Each word a nail driven with precision into the same spot, the same board, the same argument. He didn't draw in the sand now. He spoke directly, facing me, his eyes locked on mine, watching — I could feel it — for the exact expression, the precise moment, the flicker that would tell him when the erasure began.

You change reality. Your qi is autonomous. Something in you erases understanding. Six others had this. All six were stopped.

I listened.

I understood.

I watched him watching me.

And then —

It was like a hand closing over a flame. Not violent. Not painful. Gentle, even — the way you'd close a book, the way you'd draw a curtain, the way you'd fold a page. A shutting. A covering. A shadow that fell across the interior of my mind and extinguished the thing that had been burning there, the comprehension, the pattern, the truth.

For a fraction of a second — less than a heartbeat — I felt both states simultaneously. Knowing and not-knowing, layered on top of each other like layers of ice over deep water, and I could see through both, and one of them was clear and lit and true and the other was dark and empty and safe, and the dark one was WINNING, was expanding, was covering the light with the gentle, irresistible certainty of an ocean tide covering a beach —

Then it was gone.

The fire. The scrolls. Xu Ran.

"What?" I said.

His face.

I will remember his face. Even through whatever was being done to my mind, even through the erasure and the forgetting and the gentle, persistent theft of understanding, I will remember his face in that moment. Not because the memory of his expression served the investigation or advanced the pattern.

Because it was the face of a man who had just watched something terrible happen to someone, and could do nothing to stop it.

Not angry. Not frustrated.

Horrified.

"She can't hear herself," he said. To himself. To the fire. To the dark that surrounded our small circle of light like a patient audience. "She says it. She means it. And then it's taken. She can't hear her own truth."

"Xu Ran." My voice. Small. Wrong. I didn't know why. "What's happening?"

He didn't answer. He sat down. Picked up his notebook. His hands — his steady, archivist's hands — were trembling. He opened to a blank page. Wrote.

Date. Time.

*Episode 1: explained pattern. She understood. 10 seconds later, forgotten. She asked "what were you saying."*

*Episode 2: repeated explanation. She understood. 2 minutes later, forgotten. Piece by piece. Not sudden — systematic. Like someone disassembling a structure from inside.*

*Episode 3: repeated explanation. She understood. During erasure — her eyes. Not dimming. Being dimmed. Active process. Something reaching in. Not forgetting. DELETION.*

His pen stopped. He set it down. He looked at me.

The leaves above us moved. No wind. The stones around the fire hummed — a low vibration I felt in my teeth rather than heard.

Memory fragments surfaced. Not answers — debris. An image: a tree that had been on the left and was now on the right. A face: someone, somewhere, mouth open, mid-word. A feeling: warmth in stone. A sound: silence where there should have been an echo.

Shards. Splinters. Pieces of a mirror that had been shattered and scattered, and each piece reflected something different, and none of them fit together, and the act of trying to fit them together produced a headache so sharp that it crowded out thought.

I pressed my hands against my temples. Squeezed.

"Something is wrong," I said.

"Yes."

"I don't know what."

"I know."

"Something is — there's a — I can feel — " The words dissolved. Language failing, the way language fails when the thing you're trying to describe is actively preventing its own description. "There's a gap. In me. Something that should be there and isn't."

"I know what it is," he said. Quiet. Steady. The steadiness of someone standing on a ledge and refusing to look down. "But you won't remember me telling you."

"Try."

"I've tried. Three times."

"Try again."

"No." He closed the notebook. Held it against his chest. "Not tonight. Not like this. Whatever is doing this — your own protection, the thing that keeps you alive, whatever it is — it's stronger when you push. It fights harder. And I can't fight it FOR you."

The leaves settled. The stones stopped humming. The clearing returned to normal, or what passed for normal.

I sat in the quiet and felt the gap. The empty space where something had been, three times, and three times been removed. I couldn't see into it. I couldn't name it. But I could feel its edges — sharp, clean, precise. Whatever had made this cut knew exactly what it was doing.

"Something in me," I said. Not a question. Not quite a statement. Something in between — the verbal equivalent of reaching for a door handle in the dark.

"Yes," Xu Ran said. "Something in you."

I looked at my hands. They were clean. The fire reflected off my palms in warm light, and there was nothing wrong with my hands, nothing visible, nothing that would tell a stranger what lived behind my eyes and what it was willing to do to keep me safe.

To keep me ignorant.

Same thing, I suspected.

Same thing.
