The second scroll was from a different era. Fifteen hundred years old. A woman — the language markers were clear, gendered pronouns embedded in a grammatical structure that predated the gender-neutral reforms of the Middle Period.

*I tried to die,* she wrote. *My body refused. As if it knew something I did not.*

Different words. One meaning. The coincidence was too precise to be coincidence.

The third was older still — perhaps four thousand years, the script so archaic that I had to read each character three times, sounding it out internally, translating through layers of linguistic sediment. The cultivator — I couldn't determine gender from the script — had documented the very phenomena: qi that obeyed will rather than technique, anomalies in the surrounding world, a body that continued against the mind's explicit wishes.

*The world around me obeys,* this one wrote. *I have never learned this. I have never asked for it. It obeys as if I am the law and the world merely follows, and I do not know what I have done to deserve subjection so total that even the earth bends.*

Three cultivators. Three epochs. Three thousand years of distance between the first and the last.

I laid the scrolls side by side on the cleared floor of the library. The morning light fell on them in parallel beams, pinning each one to the stone like pressed leaves between pages. Xu Ran sat across from me, notebook open, watching me compare them with the focused attention of someone who understood that what was happening was important even if he didn't fully understand what it was.

"Parallels?" he asked.

"Identical experience. Different language. Three people across three millennia who had each arrived at this truth about themselves — their qi responds to will, not training. Their bodies sustain themselves against their wishes. And the world around them..." I paused. The word I wanted was *obeys,* but that word carried weight I wasn't ready to apply to myself. "Changes."

"Reality warping."

"Adjustment. The word warping implies violence. This is... softer. Retroactive. As if reality is being edited, not broken."

He wrote that down. I saw him underline *edited.*

"And all three are dead."

"All three stopped documenting. The scrolls end. Just like the inscriptions at the ruins — mid-sentence, mid-thought. No conclusion, no farewell, no sign of violence. They simply stop."

"Forgetting."

I looked at him.

"That's your theory," he said. Not accusatory — observational. "From the cave inscriptions. You said they forgot."

"Yes."

"Something made them forget what they were investigating. Erased the thought. The question. The connection."

"Yes."

"And you think whatever did that protects you too. Keeps you alive. And erases anyone who gets too close to understanding it."

I said nothing.

"Because if they understood it," he continued, his voice quiet and level, "they might try to stop it. And whatever it is doesn't want to be stopped. So it removes the threat. Not by killing — by forgetting. The cleanest erasure there is."

He was right. He was exactly right. And the fact that he had reached that conclusion from the evidence meant the evidence was clear enough for a non-cultivator scholar to read it, which meant it was not subtle at all, which meant either the truth was becoming harder to hide or I was becoming less capable of hiding it.

Or both.

"Eat something," Xu Ran said.

There was fish. He'd caught it somewhere — the nearby stream, probably, during the hours I'd spent buried in scrolls, unreachable, insensible to anything that wasn't ink on ancient paper. He'd cleaned it, gutted it, cooked it over a fire I hadn't seen. The smell was good. The fact that it was good irritated me faintly, the way competence in others irritates people who have no competence of their own in that domain.

I hadn't fished in four thousand years. I might never have fished. The memory was ambiguous — there was water, and patience, and something about a line, but the details had the quality of dreams rather than experience. I might have been remembering someone else.

I took the fish. Ate. The flesh was firm, properly cooked, seasoned with something peppery he'd found at the stream bank. I ate without pleasure, without displeasure, with the steady blankness of someone filling a vessel. But I ate.

"So I'm not the only one," I said between bites.

Xu Ran looked up from his notebook. "No."

"Others had this. The... whatever it is that keeps me alive. This qi obedience. This reality... adjustment."

"And they're all dead."

"Yes."

"Which means whatever keeps you alive didn't keep them alive."

"Or it did. For a while. And then stopped."

"Why would it stop?"

I set down the fish. The question was the right question — the one that mattered, the one that had been circling me since the first scroll like a hawk waiting for the right moment to dive. Why would protection stop? Why would a force that overrides the cultivator's own will to die suddenly allow death?

"I don't know," I said.

He picked up his chopsticks. Set them down. Picked them up again. A cycle I'd seen before — his version of thinking, the physical fidgeting of a mind working through a problem too large for stillness.

"Your body does it," he said. "Not your technique. Not your training. Your body sustains itself. Against your will."

"Yes."

"Then it's not external. It's you."

"It's something in me. That's not the same as being me."

"Isn't it?"

I looked at him across the fish bones and the scrolls and the dust and the centuries of evidence laid out between us like a bridge neither of us was sure could hold weight.

"No," I said. "Whatever this is — whatever refuses to let me die, whatever adjusts reality, whatever erased those researchers — it's not a choice I make. It's not something I do. It's something that is done to me. Through me. As if I'm the instrument, not the musician."

"And the others were instruments too."

"Apparently."

"Instruments that broke."

Silence. The fire outside crackled. A bird sang — a real bird, the right species for this region, the right season, the right time of day. I noted the rightness. It didn't comfort me.

"Maybe," Xu Ran said, and his voice was careful, the way your voice is careful when you're placing something fragile on a surface you don't trust, "you're not different from them. Maybe you're just... newer. Maybe whatever wears out instruments hasn't worn you out yet."

I finished the fish. Set the plate down. Wiped my hands on my robe.

"Or maybe," I said, "I'm the one who broke all the others."

He stopped writing.

I stood. Went to the shelf. Pulled down the next cylinder.

The afternoon passed in scrolls and silence and the slow accumulation of evidence that pointed, with the relentless precision of a compass needle, at a truth I wasn't ready to face. More cultivators. More epochs. More identical experiences — qi obedience, reality adjustment, bodies that refused death. And more identical endings.

Six total. Six cultivators across five thousand years. Six beginnings. Six erasures.

And me. Still here. Reading their words. Tasting chalk and smelling incense and feeling the cold in the metal — a cold they must have known, in places they had walked.

A shelf settled deeper into its collapse. Wood groaned. Dust sifted down.

Still alive. That word carried more weight than it should have. Alive while six others had stopped. Protected by a force I didn't understand, that didn't consult me, that operated with the cheerful indifference of something that knew better.

The hand that held me up had pushed them down. The protection and the erasure, I was beginning to suspect, were one — separated only by whether the instrument was still useful.

I didn't say any of this. I rolled up the scrolls. Stacked them in a neat pile. My hands moved with the precision of someone who has handled ancient documents for longer than most libraries have existed.

Xu Ran wrote in his notebook. The fire died to embers.

The light in the ruin shifted from gold to grey and finally to the blue that precedes total dark.
