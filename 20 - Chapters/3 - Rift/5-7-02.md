He told me while we walked.

Not at camp, not sitting down, not with the formality of a prepared disclosure. Walking. Because walking gave the words somewhere to go — forward, into the space ahead, dispersed by motion and wind and the mechanical rhythm of footsteps that provided a baseline of normalcy against which even the most abnormal information could be measured.

He'd been carrying it all morning. I could see the weight — in his posture, in the way his pack sat on his shoulders, in the tightness of his jaw that I'd learned to associate with the effort of holding something back.

"You said something," he started. "During the — during what happened."

I looked at him. "I don't remember anything happening."

"I know."

The trail was narrow here, winding between old pines, the kind of trail that forces single file and makes conversation a thing shouted over shoulders. He was behind me. I slowed to walk beside him where the path widened, because whatever he was about to say deserved eye contact, even if he seemed to be avoiding it.

"What did I say?"

He reached into his pack. The notebook — the waterproof case, the worn pages, the careful handwriting that documented everything because documentation was survival. He opened it to a page near the back, where the writing was different. Not his usual precise, organized script. This was hurried. Uneven. Written with the shaking hand of someone who knew he had to record what he'd heard before it was gone, before his own memory softened the edges.

"These aren't your words," he said. "Not your syntax. Not how you speak. It was—" He searched. "Formal. Old. Like someone reading from a text that was written before the language finished becoming itself."

He read.

Not aloud — not projected, not performed. He read in the quiet, careful voice of someone reading a translation that might not survive the journey between languages.

The words were mine and not mine.

I heard them. Recognized them the way you recognize a room you've been in once, years ago — the shape is right, the proportions are right, the feeling of the space is right, but the details are wrong, or missing, or belonged to a version of the room that no longer exists.

Old words. Words that used formal constructions I didn't use, that arranged meaning in patterns that my everyday speech didn't follow, that carried the weight of language used by someone who had been speaking for much longer than a human lifetime.

I can't reproduce them here. Not because of the wall — the wall would take them if I tried, yes, but also because they weren't meant to be reproduced. They were meant to be heard once, in the voice of a man reading them from a shaking page, on a mountain trail, with a fox-spirit three meters behind and pines overhead and the morning light doing its precise, detailed work on every surface.

They were about existence. About being. About the experience of being something that had always been and would always be and knew this about itself without needing to be told.

They were about loneliness.

Not the social loneliness of a person without company. The structural loneliness of something singular — the loneliness of the only thing of its kind, the loneliness of something that couldn't be companioned because there was nothing else like it to be a companion.

They were about choosing. About choosing to be small. About choosing to forget. About choosing to live in a body and a time and a place that were limited because limitation was the only way to experience what unlimited things cannot experience.

Finitude. The words — my words, the words of whatever part of me had spoken through the crack — were about the beauty of finitude. Of endings. Of things that mattered because they stopped.

Xu Ran's voice trailed off. He closed the notebook. Looked at me.

I had stopped walking.

"That sounds—" I started. The sentence stalled. Not because the wall took it — the wall was quiet, the wall was apparently uninterested in emotional responses to information that had already been deleted. The sentence stalled because I was looking for a word and the word was hiding.

"Right," I said. "It sounds right. I don't know why."

The feeling in my chest responded. Not with identification — not with the sudden click of recognition, not with the dramatic revelation of meaning that stories promise when characters encounter truth. With resonance. The deep, structural vibration of a tuning fork meeting its frequency. The words were true. I didn't know them, couldn't claim them, couldn't reconstruct the mind that had produced them or the moment in which they'd been spoken. But they were true in the way that mathematics is true — independent of the person perceiving them, valid regardless of context.

"Who said that?" I asked.

"You did."

"Not me. Not—" I gestured at myself. At the body, the face, the person standing on a mountain trail wearing a stolen jacket and carrying a headache and feeling cold for the first time in her life. "Not this."

"No," Xu Ran agreed. "Not this."

The crack pulsed. I pressed against it — the mental equivalent of pushing a loose tooth, the habitual gesture of someone exploring a change. The crack gave. Not much. Not enough to see through. But enough to feel the draft, and the draft carried a temperature, and the temperature was old.

Ancient. Lonely. Certain.

The same qualities as the feeling. The same resonance. The same bass note vibration that lived below thought and above silence and hummed with the confidence of something that knew what it was even if I didn't.

"Something behind the crack said those words," I said.

"Yes."

"And it's me."

"Yes."

"But I don't know it."

"Also yes."

Three yeses. Three confirmations that should have been answers and were instead doorways, each one leading to a room that contained another door, the recursive architecture of truth that retreated from approach. I was me. I had spoken. The thing behind the crack was mine. And I couldn't reach it, couldn't access it, couldn't do anything but stand on the threshold and feel the draft and know that what it carried was true and old and lonely and certain.

"That's enough for now," Xu Ran said.

He closed the notebook. Folded it into the case. Secured the case in his pack with the deliberate movements of someone who had just shared the most dangerous thing he possessed and was now putting it away.

No pressing. No follow-up. No *what do you think it means* or *how does it make you feel* or any of the thousand questions a less careful man would have asked. He'd given me the words. He'd watched me receive them. He'd confirmed what was true and stepped back, leaving the work to me, leaving the crack to me, leaving the space between the words and their meaning for me to fill in my own time.

He'd learned something in that clearing. About her — about me. About the difference between pushing someone toward truth and leaving the truth where they can find it.

"The fox is still following us," he said.

I looked back. The fox-spirit was there — three meters behind, amber eyes, the patient accompaniment of a creature that had decided we were going somewhere worth going.

"Yes," I said.

We walked. The words settled. The crack pulsed. The feeling hummed.

And somewhere deep — deeper than the wall, deeper than the guardian, deeper than the architecture of self-protection that had been building and breaking and rebuilding since the beginning — something old and lonely and certain heard its own words echoed back and recognized them.

And the recognition felt like warmth.
