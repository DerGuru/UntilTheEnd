Night. Camp. The arrangement that repetition had refined into ritual: his fire, his pot, his notebook, his meditation, his sleep. My distance, my stillness, my open eyes, my humming.

His meditation tonight was audible from ten paces. The breathing exercises he performed cross-legged by the fire — inhale through the left nostril, hold, exhale through the right — produced sounds that a charitable person might describe as disciplined. A less charitable person might describe them as a man impersonating a bellows while sitting on a rock.

I did not comment. I had stopped commenting three camps ago. The commenting had produced the notebook-scribbling and the notebook-scribbling had produced observations I did not want recorded.

The meditation ended. Sleep replaced it.

Except tonight the humming was louder.

Not louder in the audible sense — I could not hear it. The humming existed below hearing, in the range the body perceived as vibration rather than sound. But the vibration was more intense. The qi's autonomous cycling had accelerated. Whatever drove it was outputting more.

Xu Ran slept. His breathing: even. Deep-sleep breathing. His notebook: beside him. His hand: on the notebook. Even in sleep, the contact with the record was maintained.

The humming intensified.

I stood. Not decided. Not chosen. The humming intensified and the body stood the way the body stood for nausea — not because you told it to, but because it knew before you did.

I need to be upright for this.

I walked three paces from camp. Into the dark. Into the space beyond the fire's embers, beyond the area that Xu Ran's proximity had defined as camp.

The humming followed.

Not followed — continued. The humming was not external. The humming was the chest and the core and the qi and me.

I was the humming. The distinction between the body and the vibration had dissolved gradually, over the weeks from the oak root to the clearing to the hut to here. The humming had started as a phenomenon observed by a body. Now it was the body's baseline state.

I walked further. Five paces from camp. The dark was complete — no moon, cloud cover. Somewhere a night-bird called and received no answer. I walked into the dark and the humming walked with me.

The qi pulsed.

Not the involuntary jolt that emotion had produced before — those were reactions, collisions between feeling and qi that discharged on impact. This was different. This was the qi operating on its own schedule. The pulse was autonomous.

Like a heartbeat.

The qi pulsed the way the heart beat — not because I told it to, not because an event demanded it, but because whatever drove it had reached the point in its cycle where the pulse was next. Regular. Rhythmic. Running itself regardless of my participation.

The pulse radiated outward. Three paces — the standard radius. But it extended beyond. Five paces. Seven. The way a sleeping animal stretched its limbs — not purposefully, but because the body's cycle included stretching whether the mind participated or not.

The grass at seven paces: trembled. Not died — trembled. Below the lethal threshold but above the perceptible one. The grass felt the pulse.

I watched it tremble and understood that the thing being observed was not external. The grass was trembling because of me. The pulse was from me. Whatever this was, it was mine.

And it was running on a schedule I had not written.

The pulse returned. Contracted. Seven paces back to three. The standard radius reasserted itself. The expansion: over. The testing: complete.

I stood in the dark. Three paces of dead grass around me, unchanging. Beyond three: trembling grass, recovering. Beyond seven: untouched, unaffected, the world that had not yet been reached.

The humming continued. The qi cycling in its autonomous pattern — the pattern I did not control, that controlled itself, that was expanding its repertoire from passive cycling to active pulsing.

Something in me was running. Something with its own schedule, its own objectives, its own momentum. Something that was not waiting for my participation.

I walked back to camp. Three paces from where Xu Ran slept. His hand on the notebook. His breathing: uninterrupted. He had not felt the pulse. Or he had felt it and slept through it.

I sat. On the brown grass. In my radius. In my humming.

The sensation of being occupied by a process that was not mine but that used my body as its medium and its instrument and the thing through which it expressed itself into the world.

Everything was echoing. The humming. The pulsing. The retroactive paths. Everything that was happening was the reverberation of something that had happened before, or that was happening elsewhere, or that was happening inside me in a register I could not access.

Echoes of what, I did not know. The question was larger than the ones I had carried so far — larger than why-not-him, larger than what-protects-me. This question was:

What am I?

The question did not produce an answer. The question produced the humming. The humming produced the question. The loop was closed and the loop was running and the running was the condition and the condition was: me. Standing in the dark. Three paces of dead grass. Something breathing through me that was not my breath.

I would think about this night later. Much later. When the pulse had become something else entirely and the three-pace radius was a memory of smallness. I would think: that was the night it stopped being something that happened to me and became something I was.

But that was later. That night, I sat in the dark and hummed.

Dawn came. Light changed. Xu Ran woke.

I was sitting where I had been. His hand left the notebook. His eyes opened.

"The grass," he said. Looking at the seven-pace circle. The circle that had been three paces when he fell asleep and was now seven — the kind of data-point that made his hand reach for the notebook before his eyes fully focused.

"It pulsed," I said.

"Pulsed." He repeated the word flat, stripped of affect, testing whether the syllables bore the weight of what they described. "The radius expanded from three to seven meters during the night. That is not a pulse. That is a categorical change."

"It contracted back."

He looked at the dead grass. At the trembling grass beyond it. At the boundary where trembling faded into stillness.

"It contracted back," he said, "but the seven-meter circle is still visible. The grass remembers." He wrote. The brush paused. "Do you remember?"

The question was not about the grass.

"I remember standing up," I said. "I remember the dark."

He waited. The waiting was the thing he did when the data was incomplete and he believed more was coming. More was not coming. That was all I had — standing, dark, the humming that was louder than it should have been.

He wrote what I gave him. He did not write what I withheld.

The humming continued. Under everything. Between everything. Through everything.

The echo that was becoming the voice.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Expanded 2 dialog markers into 5 exchanges (kept "The grass" / "It pulsed"; added "categorical change" analysis, "It contracted back" / "The grass remembers. Do you remember?", "I remember standing up. I remember the dark.")
- Applied Global Patterns: Sparse tags, undertext ("Do you remember?" is not about grass — it probes Yun's agency), distinct voices (Xu Ran's clinical "categorical change" vs Yun's sensory fragments), silence as withholding
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The ending is sharpened — "The echo that was becoming the voice" now lands as its own sentence-paragraph, and Xu Ran's "The grass remembers" mirrors the chapter's theme of autonomous processes that persist beyond their trigger.
