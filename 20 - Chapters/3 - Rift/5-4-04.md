I couldn't sleep. The headache had settled into something permanent — not sharp enough to incapacitate, not dull enough to ignore. The steady ache of a body arguing with itself.

I lay on my back and stared at the sky. The stars were right. The constellation patterns matched my memory. The moon was in the correct position for this date, this latitude, this season. I checked each one with the attention of someone counting coins, wanting to be sure.

Xu Ran slept. His notebook was under his hand — not beside him, not in his pack, under his hand. As if he'd fallen asleep guarding it. As if the information inside was something that needed protection now in a way it hadn't before.

Memories came.

Not the kind I expected. Debris. Fragments of things that had no business being together, connected by nothing except the fact that they all belonged to me.

A village. Rooftops. Smoke. Not the smoke of cooking — the smoke of endings. I didn't know which village. I didn't know which ending.

A hand — my hand — pressing against a wall. Stone. Cool. Lines carved into the surface. I'd done this before. I was always doing this. The same motion, the same search, the same fingers tracing grooves that someone had cut into the world and left for me to find. Or that I had cut and left for myself.

A face. Young. Male. Brown eyes. Open mouth. He was saying something. I couldn't hear the words. The face meant something — I could feel the meaning pressing against the inside of my chest like a fist — but the meaning was sealed behind something opaque and thick and absolutely, unwaveringly committed to staying closed.

My head pulsed.

They didn't assemble. They sat in my mind like shards of broken glass — dangerous, sharp, refusing to reconstruct.

The tree was on the left. I was certain of that. The tree — I could see it clearly, though the place and time wouldn't come — had been on the left side of a path I couldn't name. It was the kind of certainty that lives in the body rather than the mind, the certainty of muscle memory and spatial instinct.

But if I went to that path — wherever it was — the tree would be on the right. I knew that too. Both things true. Both things impossible. The tree on the left and the tree on the right, the same tree, the same path, separated by a shift so quiet that nobody else would even notice the discrepancy.

Nobody except me.

The headache sharpened. I pressed my fist against my forehead and held it there.

*Not now.*

The gate again. The interior voice — the one that sounded like me but acted independently. Stop. Don't look. Let it go.

The fragments dissolved. Like sugar in water — present, dissolved, detectable only by the fact that everything tasted different now.

I opened my eyes. The stars were still right.

I got up. Walked to the stream.

The water was cold. Clear. I knelt and put my hands in it. Washed them. Not because they were dirty — because the motion felt necessary.

But it was there. On my hands. The residue of something I'd almost held and had been made to drop.

I washed for five minutes. Maybe ten. The water ran over my skin and carried away nothing.

Xu Ran found me there.

He stood behind me. Said nothing. Waited.

I stopped washing. Looked at my hands. They were red from the cold water, the skin tight, the blood retreating from the surface. Clean. Empty.

"Something happened," I said.

"Yes."

"Something important."

"Yes."

"I don't remember what."

He was quiet for a long time. The stream filled the silence with its own conversation — meaningless, persistent, the sound of water talking to stone about nothing especially.

"I wrote it down," he said.

I turned. He held out his notebook. Open. The page filled with his handwriting — precise, measured, the script of a man who understands that written records are the only defense against a world that keeps rewriting itself.

I read.

*Episode 1: explained pattern. She understood. 10 seconds later, forgotten. She asked "what were you saying."*

*Episode 2: repeated explanation. She understood. 2 minutes later, forgotten. Piece by piece. Like someone disassembling a structure from inside.*

*Episode 3: repeated explanation. She understood. During erasure — her eyes. Being dimmed. Active process. Not forgetting. DELETION.*

My own words were there. Things I'd apparently said. *"Yes." "Okay." "I hear you. I understand."*

"That doesn't sound like me," I said.

"It does." Quiet. Certain. "Exactly like you."

I read the entries again. Three times. The words were there. They meant things. They described an event — a night, words, silences — that I had apparently lived through.

I didn't remember any of it.

I could feel the outlines. Three of them. Three deletions.

I couldn't see what had been inside them.

I handed the notebook back. He took it. Closed it. Held it against his chest.

"The gap," I said. "In me. It's bigger now."

"I know."

"Whatever is in there — whatever is being protected — it's important."

"I know."

"And I can't reach it."

"Not yet."

"Maybe not ever."

He looked at me. The morning was arriving — a thin grey line along the eastern ridge. In the growing dawn, his face was tired. Older than it should have been.

"You'll reach it," he said. "Not through thinking. Not through me explaining. Thinking is what it blocks. Explaining is what it erases. Whatever lives in you — it sits between knowing and remembering, and it decides what passes."

"Then how?"

He looked at the stream.

"I don't know yet," he said.

I stood. Wiped my hands on my robe. Walked back to the fire.

The embers were dying. The scrolls were still there. The sand drawings — faded now, softened by night wind, barely legible — traced their patterns in the dirt.

The bowl of rice from last night sat where Xu Ran had left it. Cold now. The grains stuck together in a single congealed mass.

I picked it up. Ate. Cold rice past the knot in my throat, each bite deliberate.

Xu Ran watched. Said nothing.

The gap pulsed.

I ignored it and kept eating.

## Edit Notes (What Changed)
- Fixed [HIGH]: Cut 10 post-show analytical cascades — memory-type taxonomy after "Memories came," three-fragments analysis paragraph after "My head pulsed," pressure-equalization metaphor after headache, gate-voice explanation after "*Not now*," cultivator-cleanliness digression + sealed-room filing analysis during hand-washing, light-sleeper-instinct explanation after Xu Ran arrives, absence-as-presence analytical paragraph after "I didn't remember," notebook-clutch symbolism analysis, "battle he can neither fight" face-reading, gravity-philosophy stream meditation after "Then how?"
- Applied Global Patterns: Compressed "the kind of X that Y" constructions; removed redundant em-dash over-definitions; cut "whose X was Y" chain in light-sleeper passage
- Biggest clarity/pacing win: The notebook scene now moves from reading → not remembering → "The gap is bigger" without the four-sentence metaphysical essay on the texture of absence slowing the emotional throughline.
