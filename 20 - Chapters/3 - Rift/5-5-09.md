We walked for two days without incident.

I say *without incident* the way you might say *without major earthquake* — an accurate statement that excludes a catalogue of smaller events. The stone-shifting continued. Small things — a root that caught my foot where no root should have been, a branch that gave way under Xu Ran's hand when he reached for balance, a ledge that crumbled at the exact point where we'd planned to rest. Nothing dangerous. Nothing dramatic. Just the persistent, nagging wrongness of a world that had decided to be slightly less cooperative.

The flask kept leaking. I emptied it, dried it, refilled it. It leaked again. Same seam. Same thin film of moisture. I checked the stitching — intact, tight, no visible flaw. The leak had no mechanical cause. The leak existed because things were going wrong, one small thing at a time, in the steady rhythm of something being repaid.

On the second evening, Xu Ran built the fire.

He was good at fires. Had been good since the early weeks, since he'd learned — through repetition and the quiet pride of a man who values competence — to select the right wood, to arrange the kindling, to create the initial spark with the small fire-steel he carried. I'd watched him build a hundred fires. He'd never failed.

He struck the steel. Sparks landed on tinder. The tinder didn't catch.

He adjusted. Blew gently. Reconfigured the kindling — drier pieces, smaller pieces, positioned to catch the spark from a better angle. Struck again.

Nothing.

His jaw tightened. The familiar tightening of frustration that he managed with discipline, the way he managed everything — by acknowledging the emotion, categorizing it, and proceeding through it with the methodical patience of someone who did not permit obstacles to become excuses.

Third try. New tinder. Fresh sparks. Careful breath.

The fire caught.

But it took three tries. And Xu Ran had never needed three tries.

I watched the flames grow from the initial hesitant flicker to the steady, self-sustaining burn that meant the fire would last. The wood crackled. The warmth expanded. Normal. Ordinary. The most basic human technology — controlled combustion, heat, light, the domestication of a force that predated every other tool.

Three tries.

"It's happening to you too," I said.

He looked up from the fire. The flames reflected in his eyes — orange, shifting, alive in the way that fire is alive, which is not the way that people are alive but close enough to be mistaken.

"The stone yesterday. The branch today. The fire."

"I noticed."

"I'm sorry."

He considered this. The apology. The weight of it. The implication — that I was the cause, that whatever was going wrong with the small workings of daily life was radiating from me like warmth from a fire, reaching the things and people near me and making them slightly, persistently, cumulatively less fortunate.

"Don't apologize for things you can't control," he said. "Save the apologies for things you choose."

It should have been comforting. It wasn't. Because the distinction between what I chose and what I couldn't control was eroding with every chapter of whatever story I was living, and the day might come — soon, maybe already — when choice wasn't mine to claim.

He cooked. I watched the fire and thought about the mountain.

Not the missing piece — I'd spent enough time looking at that absence, enough time sitting with the knowledge that I'd removed three hundred meters of geography from the world's inventory. I thought about the mountain that remained. The part that was still there. Still standing. Still being a mountain in the way that mountains are mountains — through persistence, through the simple commitment to existing in the same place regardless of what happened around them.

The mountain hadn't moved. Hadn't crumbled. Hadn't collapsed into the gap I'd left. It had simply continued, accommodating the absence the way old things accommodate damage — by being.

There was a lesson there. Probably. I wasn't in the mood for lessons.

Xu Ran handed me a bowl. Rice with dried mushrooms — a variation, a small one, the kind of minor adjustment to routine that he introduced periodically because he understood that monotony was its own form of erosion. The mushrooms were chewy and tasted of earth and smoke and the deep umami that comes from things that have been dried properly.

I ate mechanically. Chewing because chewing was what mouths did with food, swallowing because swallowing was what throats did with chewed food, the whole process a sequence of biological imperatives that didn't require conscious participation or emotional investment. Fuel. Maintenance. The body insisting on its needs regardless of what the mind was doing.

Xu Ran ate too. His injured finger — the self-test, the deliberate cut — had scabbed over. The scab was dark and small and completely ordinary, the kind of minor wound that every body accumulates and heals and forgets. He hadn't forgotten it. His eyes went to it periodically, checking, confirming, reassuring himself that the damage was still there, that the scab was real, that the world was playing by its normal rules.

After dinner, we sat. The fire burned. The night settled around us with the patient darkness of altitude, where the sky is close and the stars are sharp and the sense of being exposed — small, visible, unprotected — is acute.

I should have thought about what I was. That was the question that had been driving everything — the investigations, the ruins, the scrolls, the cultivation techniques that defied categorization. *What am I.* A question that assumed an answer existed, that assumed the answer was knowable, that assumed knowing would help.

But sitting there, watching the fire and eating rice and feeling the headache pulse and knowing that a section of mountain was missing because of me, the question changed.

It wasn't *what am I* anymore.

It was *how much can I destroy.*

Not melodramatically. Not the anguished rhetorical question of someone performing distress. Practically. In the cold, grounded way that a person with a weapon assesses its range. I had split trees. Had made weather. Had locked reality. Had erased a mountain flank from existence so completely that the world didn't remember it had been there.

The scale was increasing. Each event was larger than the last. The trajectory was clear and the trajectory was upward and the question of where the trajectory ended was not philosophical. It was geographical.

How many mountains. How many valleys. How many villages with three red circles on a sect map.

And beneath that question, quieter, more personal, more terrifying in its simplicity:

*Can I stop?*

Not *will I stop* — that was about choice, and choice was becoming academic. Can. The bare physical question. Did whatever I was becoming have an off switch, a limit, a point where the escalation reached its ceiling and the power stabilized and the world stopped being a thing I accidentally edited?

I didn't know.

*Not now,* the thought came, and I let it come, and it settled into the place where the other thoughts lived — the growing archive of things I wasn't ready to examine, the shelf where I put the questions that didn't have answers and might not ever have answers. Their not-having-answers was itself a kind of answer.

"I'm eating," I said, to nobody. To Xu Ran, who was there. To the mountain, which was partially there. To the world, which was entirely there and slightly less cooperative than it had been.

The statement was declarative and defiant and exactly as pointless as it sounded. I was eating. The world was taking things from me — memories, control, mountains — and I was sitting here eating rice with dried mushrooms and letting the fire be warm and letting the night be dark and letting my body perform its biological functions with the stubborn insistence of a thing that refused to stop.

Xu Ran's mouth did the thin thing. Not humor. Not quite. The acknowledgment of humor's possibility, seen from a distance, through fog.

"You're eating," he confirmed.

"Yes."

"Good."

Good. The word he'd used when his test-cut had stayed cut. Good. The mortal's word for *the worst hasn't happened yet.* Good. The traveler's word for *we're still moving.*

I finished the rice. Set down the bowl. The fire crackled and spat a spark that landed on the ground and died.

Tomorrow we would walk. East, probably, because east was where the world wanted me to go and I'd stopped arguing with geography. We would walk and the stones would shift beneath our feet and the flask would leak and the fire would resist, and these small wrongnesses would accumulate like rain in a basin, filling slowly, rising, approaching a level that I couldn't yet see.

But for now — right now — I was eating. I was warm. The fire was lit, even if it had taken three tries. The stars were out, and they didn't care what I'd done to a mountain or what a mountain had done to me.

Stars are good at not caring. It's their primary function.

My head hurt. My bowl was empty. The night continued.
