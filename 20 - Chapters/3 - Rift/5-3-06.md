We moved faster after that.

Not running. Running implies being chased, and we weren't — not yet, not exactly. But the pace changed. We covered ground with the restless efficiency of people who know that stillness has become more dangerous than motion, that every day spent in one place gives the world another day to adjust around them, and that eventually the adjustments would bring someone to the door.

Three days of hard walking. South and west, into hill country that folded in on itself like crumpled paper, the kind of terrain where sight lines are short and trails dead-end against cliff faces and the geography itself seems designed for people who don't want to be found.

Good country for hiding. Bad country for research.

I hadn't touched a ruin in six days. Six days without a new site, without new findings, without the familiar tension that came from pressing my hands against old stone and feeling the foundation qi respond with the warmth of recognition. The list sat frozen at fourteen. Fifteen, if you counted the chalk marks.

I counted the chalk marks.

The world didn't stop adjusting. That was the worst part. Even without my probing, without my investigation, reality continued its subtle, patient editorial work. Small things — always small things. A tree species at the wrong altitude. A stream flowing a few degrees off the expected heading. A star that I was increasingly uncertain about, its position differing from my memory by an amount that might have been precession and might have been something else.

The ache continued. They came in patterns now — not random, not in response to certain thoughts, but rhythmic, like a tide. Pain in the mornings. Pain before sleep. The kind of persistent low-grade pressure that becomes part of your landscape, so constant that you stop noticing it and start building around it instead.

I rubbed my temples. Xu Ran noticed. He always noticed.

"How long?" he asked.

"Since the library."

"Every day?"

"Most days."

"Have they changed?"

I considered. The episodes had, in fact, changed — not in intensity but in character. The early ones had been sharp, reactive, the kind that came when my thinking approached dangerous territory and served as a clear, functional warning: *stop.* The current ones were different. Duller. Less targeted. More like a generalized weight behind the eyes, as if something inside my skull was taking up more space than it used to and the container was protesting.

"They're broader," I said. "Less exact."

"That means they're either getting worse or you're getting used to them."

"Or both."

He didn't push. He was doing that more — holding back at moments when the old Xu Ran would have pressed forward. Not out of respect. Out of something more calculated: the understanding that information given voluntarily is more reliable than information extracted.

We reached a small town at the edge of the hill country. The kind of place that exists for a single purpose — a river crossing, a mining depot, a market hub — and has no ambition beyond fulfilling that purpose. This one was a crossroads: north-south and east-west routes intersecting at a bridge over a narrow but forceful river. The buildings were practical, the people were practical, and the tea house was two rooms with a sagging roof and tea that wasn't terrible.

I sat by the window. Xu Ran ordered. Outside, the town moved through its late-afternoon routine — merchants packing up stalls, children running in the diminishing light, a sect courier passing through at speed with dispatches that probably contained the same frightened reports we'd been hearing for weeks.

Normal life. The kind that continues regardless of what's happening to the qi currents or the spiritual balance or the academic machinations of a man called the Pencil. Normal life doesn't care about anomalies. Normal life cares about dinner.

I envied that.

"You're staring at the children," Xu Ran said.

"Am I."

"Three minutes. The same three. The ones with the ball."

I hadn't been aware of the duration. The children were playing a game that involved kicking something round between them with more enthusiasm than skill. They shouted. They laughed. They fell down and got up with the elastic resilience of bodies that haven't yet learned they're supposed to be careful.

"They're loud," I said.

"They're children."

"Same thing."

He set tea in front of me. The cup was cracked — a hairline fracture running from the rim to about halfway down, barely visible, the kind of imperfection that a good ceramicist would have discarded and this tea house had decided was fine.

I traced the crack with my finger. Hairline. Barely there. But once you saw it, you couldn't unsee it. The whole cup — its shape, its weight, its capacity to hold liquid — was defined by this fracture. Not broken. Not whole. Cracked.

The metaphor was too obvious. I drank the tea instead of thinking about it.

"The delegation knew your route," Xu Ran said. "They have resources. Intelligence. Informants. The Pencil has been building for two years."

"Yes."

"If he knows where we've been, he knows where we're going."

"Probably."

"Which means moving faster doesn't help. It just means they catch up out of breath."

I looked at him over the rim of the cracked cup.

"What do you suggest?"

"Stop running. Start planning." He opened his notebook. I recognized the page — his anomaly map, a hand-drawn chart of our route with numbered markers at each documented anomaly site. Lines connected the markers. The pattern was visible even at arm's length: a rough spiral, tightening as we moved south, each site closer to the one before it, the intervals shrinking as if whatever was drawing us forward was losing patience.

"We're spiraling," he said. "Look."

I looked. He was right. The route I'd been following — the instinct that said *south, go south, the next site is south* — wasn't random. It was a spiral. Tightening. Converging on a center.

I hadn't noticed. I, who noticed everything — wrong paths, wrong winds, wrong stars — hadn't noticed that my own trajectory was a pattern. That I was being drawn. That the spiral had a destination.

The headache pulsed. Once. Warning.

"Where does it converge?" I asked.

Xu Ran traced the lines with his finger, extending the spiral's arc, projecting its path beyond the last marked point. His finger moved south and west, curving, tightening, until it came to rest on a spot he'd marked with a small x.

"Here," he said. "About four days from now, at the current pace."

"What's there?"

"According to the maps? Nothing. Mountain range. Uninhabited. No sects, no villages, no recorded structures."

"According to my memory?"

He looked up.

I stared at the x on his map. The spot meant nothing visually — a coordinate, a guess, a projection based on guesswork and gaps. But something in my chest tightened when I looked at it. Not the pain. Something deeper. Something that felt like recognition dressed in a coat it hadn't worn before.

"I've been there," I said.

"When?"

"I don't remember."

He waited.

"I've been there, and I don't remember what's there, and the fact that I don't remember is — " The pressure surged. Not a pulse. A wall. Solid, sudden, the worst it had been — a crushing weight that turned the light painful and the sound of children playing into a razor against the inside of my skull.

I pressed my hands against my temples. Closed my eyes. The world turned red behind my eyelids.

*Enough.*

The thought wasn't mine. Or — it was mine, but from somewhere below me, below thinking, below deciding. A reflex. A ward. The same voice that said *Not now* and *Keep going,* the part of me that decided what I was allowed to think and what was sealed behind doors I couldn't find the handles to.

*Enough.*

The pressure eased. The red faded. The children's voices returned to normal.

I opened my eyes. Xu Ran was watching me with the expression of someone who has seen confirmation of something he already suspected and isn't sure whether to be relieved or afraid.

"The headaches are connected," he said. Not a question.

"They're a symptom."

"Of what?"

Of whatever closes the doors. Of whatever keeps the pages folded. Of whatever stopped seven researchers mid-sentence and erased their thoughts and left their work unfinished and their lives — their curiosities, their brilliance, their stubborn human need to understand — ground to nothing by a force that lived inside them and loved them too much to let them see what it was.

"Of me," I said.

He closed the notebook. Finished his tea. Stood.

"Four days," he said. "We have four days to decide whether we walk into that spiral's center or turn around."

I looked out the window. The children had stopped playing. The ball sat in the dust, abandoned, perfectly still. Beyond the town, the hills rose in layers of green and grey and the darkening blue of approaching dusk.

"We don't turn around," I said.

He nodded. As if he'd known. As if the question had been a formality, a courtesy extended to the possibility of caution before caution was rejected.

We left the tea house. The cracked cup sat on the table, empty, its fracture catching the last light.
