He told me about Wei on an evening when the fire was low and the smoke drifted east and the smoke smelled like damp wood.

The smell was the trigger. Not his words — the smoke. Damp wood. Green wood. The smell reached something below the disconnection —

"I was there," Xu Ran said. "Not close. Half a li. But I saw it."

The words were background. The smell was foreground.

"The boy fought at the front." His voice: level. Factual. A report, not a eulogy. "I'd heard about the settlement — rumors, mostly. A cultivator protecting civilians. Unusual enough to track. I arrived the morning it happened."

He paused. Wrote something. Continued.

"He was good. Better than he should have been, with that core. He moved like someone who had been trained by someone who understood movement at a level that most cultivators never reach. His footwork was — " He stopped. "Efficient. I'll say efficient."

Efficient. Wei's barefoot efficiency. The martial grace that I had taught him without teaching him, that he had absorbed the way he absorbed everything — stubbornly, incompletely, with the imperfection that made it his rather than mine.

"He killed one of them. Not cleanly — he never would have. His cultivation wasn't at that level. But he killed one, and the other two adjusted, and the adjustment was the beginning of the end."

The smoke drifted. The smell continued. Damp wood. Green wood. The combination that existed also in the memory of a different fire, a different season, a hut with a low ceiling where —

"The light came from the west. Something — I didn't understand it then. Something enormous. A presence. It distracted them. Two, maybe three breaths."

The Immortal+ on the western hill. The two-finger salute. The distraction I had manufactured to buy time that wasn't enough.

"Then the attack with three fronts. Fire first. Civilians second. Then a third — a scout, through where the boy had been holding the line. He'd moved to help with the fire. The gap was there."

The syntax of military failure. The gap. The sequence. The exploitable absence that existed because Wei was the kind of person who moved toward fire rather than held the line and the moving-toward was the compassion and the compassion was the gap.

"I saw. Half a li. Nothing I could do at that distance."

Nothing anyone could do. The sentence was a kindness he didn't intend and that I didn't need. Nothing anyone could do was the category that described most of my history and the most-of was the thing and the thing was Wei standing in a gap because a child was running and a child running was the kind of thing Wei could not not respond to.

Something broke.

Not loudly. Not visibly. Inside. Below. In the layer where the disconnection operated — where wanting had been cut and eating had stopped and sleep had become optional. Below that. In the layer where facts lived.

The fact: Wei died while I was twenty seconds away. The fact: Wei died because he moved toward fire. The fact: Wei's core was already cracked and the crack was old and the old was years and the years were years near me.

The fact: I knew all of this already and hearing it from someone else's mouth did not change what I knew. It changed where the knowing lived. It moved the knowing from behind glass to in front of glass. The removal of the barrier between knowing and feeling — that was the break.

My qi jolted.

Involuntary. The discharge that occurred when something emotional collided with something immovable. The leaves on the nearest tree — five paces away — curled. Not dramatically. Like paper near heat.

Xu Ran felt it. His arm hair lifted. He looked at me — the look of someone who understood that the atmospheric shift came from the person standing four body-lengths away. He opened his notebook.

He wrote. While I stood there with the break inside me and the leaves curling and the smoke smelling like the hut where I had sat with Wei and the hut was gone and Wei was gone and the smoke was just smoke —

He wrote.

No comfort. No condolence. He had told what he had seen. That was the offering. The offering was information and information was the currency and the currency was complete. He did not say he was sorry. He did not touch me. He did not perform any of the elaborate rituals that human beings performed when they wanted to indicate that another human being's pain was visible to them.

He wrote.

The break was not healing. Not grief. The break was a crack in the glass that the disconnection had installed. Small. A line. Not enough to shatter. Enough to let sound through.

Wei fighting at the front. Wei moving toward fire. Wei's core cracking in a gap that existed because he moved toward a child. Sound, through the crack. Not words. Not memory. Frequency. The vibration of a truth that had been sealed behind glass and was now audible through the fissure:

He deserved to live. More than I did. And whatever I am — the thing that survives, the thing that regenerates, the thing that produces death in a three-pace radius and cannot produce death in itself — that thing should have been his.

The smoke shifted. The fire dimmed. Xu Ran closed his notebook.

The memory came.

Not Wei. Not this time — the connection fired sideways, the way memory dodged when the direct path hurt too much. The trigger: the smoke. The destination: different.

A woman. Eight hundred years ago. Or close to that — the timeline was approximation, the way all timelines became approximation after the first millennium. Her name was Mei. She lived in a house near a river in a province that no longer existed under that name. She had taken me in the way people sometimes took in travelers — with practical hospitality that required nothing in return except the traveler's eventual departure.

She cooked for me. Rice. Vegetables from a garden. The meals of seasonal availability and limited resources and the skill of someone who had cooked for decades — who understood what heat did to starch and what salt did to greens and what patience did to both. Her left index finger was crooked, bent at the second joint, and she held the knife around it like it was part of the handle.

I stayed three months. The longest I had stayed anywhere in that century. Something beyond convenience — something approaching what other people called home, what I called the temporary cessation of movement.

She developed a cough. Week three. Deep, productive, the kind that worsened at night. Treatable. Easily. A qi-manipulation that directed warmth to the inflamed tissue, one I had performed hundreds of times.

I noticed it. I did not treat it. The memory provided no reason. Only fact: she coughed. I noticed. I did nothing. The nothing stretched — week three to week five to week seven — and the coughing worsened and the worsening was predictable and the predictability was the thing I knew and did not act on.

She died at the end of the third month. In her house. Near her river. Her lungs had given out slowly, and she had been conscious for it, and she had been hosted by an immortal who could have prevented it and who hadn't.

Mei. With the crooked finger and the patient cooking and the cough I did not treat.

You never asked about her. About any of them. You had the sense not to ask — or the fear.

I did not know why. Then or now. The memory did not include the explanatory framework that justified the inaction. Only the inaction itself, burned into the sequence like a step in a process that I had followed without understanding the process.

The pattern. The recurring pattern: proximity, attachment, failure, loss. Mei eight hundred years ago. Wei, months ago. Others. The same architecture. The same result.

The smoke had died to embers. Xu Ran slept. His breathing: even, the rhythm of someone who slept the way he did everything else — efficiently, without waste.

I stood. The break inside: still cracked. The sound through the fissure: still audible. The memory present, in the space it occupied when suppression had a crack in it.

Morning would come. He would write. I would stand.

The pattern would continue.
