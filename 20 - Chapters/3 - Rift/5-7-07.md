Xu Ran was cooking when I came back from the river.

He looked up. The assessment — quick, thorough, the automatic scan of a man who had learned to read the difference between her-after-something-happened and her-after-nothing-happened. He looked at my face. My eyes. The set of my jaw. The way I moved — which was different, though I didn't realize it yet, something in my posture having shifted during the minutes at the water, something in the way I carried weight having redistributed.

"Everything okay?" he asked.

"Yes."

It was a lie. Not a malicious one — the kind of lie that exists between people who trust each other enough to not require complete disclosure, the kind that means *something happened and I'm working through it and I'll tell you when I can* without needing to say any of those words.

He knew it was a lie. I saw the recognition — the brief flicker of analysis, the categorization of my response as incomplete, the decision to accept it anyway. He turned back to the cooking. Rice and something green — a plant he'd found near the river, edible, the kind of foraging discovery that pleased him because it represented competence applied to the practical.

I sat by the fire. The warmth was good — real warmth, fire warmth, the kind that came from outside and had to be received. The cold in my bones eased. The morning chill retreated from my extremities in the slow, gradual yielding of temperature to temperature.

The feeling was still there. Changed now — or rather, my relationship to it had changed. The nameless frequency, the bass note vibration that the deletion couldn't reach, was the same. But I heard it differently. Before the river, the feeling had been mysterious. Alien. Something present in me that I couldn't identify, couldn't categorize, couldn't file under any heading that my experience provided.

Now it was familiar.

Not understood — I still couldn't name it, still couldn't define it, still couldn't describe it in terms that would survive the wall's scrutiny. But familiar the way a voice is familiar when you hear it in a crowd — you don't know who's speaking, can't see their face, can't place them in your history, but you know you've heard them before. You know they belong to your life.

The feeling belonged to my life. The feeling was my life — or a part of it, or the foundation of it, or the thing that my life was built on the way buildings are built on bedrock, supported by something that the structure itself can't see.

Xu Ran handed me a bowl. Rice with the green plant, which he'd wilted with steam and seasoned with the salt from the market. Simple. Good. The flavors were distinct — individual compounds registering on my tongue, the bitterness of the green offset by the starch of the rice offset by the mineral sharpness of the salt. Every bite was an event. Every bite was too much information, taken in by a palate that was still adjusting to its new sensitivity.

I ate anyway. I was getting better at the too-much. Learning to let the input arrive without resisting it, the way a river learns the shape of new stones — not by fighting them but by flowing around them until the flow itself adjusts.

"I saw something at the river," I said.

He looked up. Careful. The new carefulness, the post-clearing carefulness that weighed every interaction against the cost of the last one.

"What?"

I considered. The wall was quiet. The guardian was quiet. Whatever watchfulness governed my access to truth was apparently uninterested in what I'd seen at the river — either because the content was below its threshold or because the content was too foreign for its classifications or because whatever I'd seen was sanctioned, permitted, allowed.

Or because the thing that did the monitoring was the thing I'd seen.

"My reflection," I said. "It — did something."

He waited. Notebook closed. Hands still.

"It smiled before I did."

He weighed this. The silence was the silence of deep thought — the quiet of a mind turning over implications, sifting through what he knew, tracing the consequences that any new revelation produces when added to a picture already heavy with unknowns.

"Before," he repeated.

"Half a second. Maybe less. It was smiling before I started to smile."

"And you weren't scared."

Not a question. An observation. He'd read it in my face — the absence of fear, the absence of the defensive tension that had accompanied every previous anomaly, every previous encounter with the thing inside me that operated without consent.

"No. It felt—" I searched. The word was there, somewhere, hiding behind inadequacy and imprecision and the fundamental insufficiency of language when applied to experiences that language wasn't designed for. "Warm."

"Warm."

"Like someone was glad to see me."

He was quiet for a long time. The fire crackled. The green plant wilted further in the residual steam. The fox-spirit slept in its bush, amber eyes closed, dreaming whatever minor spirit beasts dream about.

"You're not going to write that down," I said.

He looked at me. Looked at his pack, where the notebook lived. Looked back.

"No," he said.

"Why not?"

"Because some things aren't documentation. Some things are—" He paused. Xu Ran pausing mid-sentence was rare enough to constitute an event. "Yours."

He went back to eating. I went back to eating. The fire burned. The river ran nearby, invisible from camp but audible, the constant murmur of water over stone that had been the background of this place since before we'd arrived and would continue being the background after we left.

I didn't tell him the rest. Didn't tell him about the understanding — the wordless, imageless, purely-felt comprehension that the thing behind the wall was me. Not an invader. Not a warden. Not an external force imposed upon an unwilling subject. Me. A part of me that was older and deeper and lonelier than anything I could access and that wanted, with a ferocity I couldn't fathom, for me to live.

Some things belonged only to me.

The evening came. The stars appeared. The cold settled in, and I pulled the jacket tighter — torn seam and all, the imperfect garment that kept imperfect warmth against imperfect skin — and felt the feeling pulse, and let it pulse, and didn't press against the crack, and didn't push the loose tooth, and didn't try to think about what had happened or what it meant or what would come next.

I sat by the fire and was warm and was cold and was both and was alive and was me.

And somewhere deep — behind the crack, behind the wall, in the place where the reflection lived and the ancient thing breathed and the truth waited with the patience of something that had waited since before the concept of patience had been invented — something smiled.

Not because it was happy. Because I was.
