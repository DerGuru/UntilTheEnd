Night.

The fire held. I fed it the broken wood — the irony of using the wreckage of my own force to keep the victim warm. The fire held and the night arrived and Xu Ran did not wake.

He breathed. The wet sound had diminished to the occasional catch — the breathing of someone whose airways were clearing but whose ribs were broken. Shallow. Careful. His body knew the ribs were broken even though his consciousness did not know anything because his consciousness was absent.

I sat beside him. Two paces. The closest I had been since the shockwave. Two paces, not ten. The observational distance was: suspended. The arrangement was: suspended. Everything was suspended except the fire and his breathing and my waiting.

The fire cast the light that firelight cast — warm in colour, unsteady, the shadows moving with the flame. His face in the firelight: pale. Blood dried on his temple where the pressure bandage had controlled the laceration. His eyes closed. His notebook was in the wreckage somewhere — blown away by the wave, the pages possibly scattered, the documentation possibly lost.

I did not look for the notebook.

I watched him breathe.

The watching was the thing. Not the experiment. Not the poison. Not the shockwave or the revelation or the *Rein* that had arrived from the place where the direction lived. The watching. This. A woman sitting beside a fire, watching a man breathe, waiting to know if the breathing would continue or stop.

I was not sleeping. But this time the not-sleeping was different from before. Before was: forgetting. I forgot to sleep because sleeping required will and the will was absent. This was: choosing. I chose not to sleep because sleeping meant leaving and the man beside the fire needed the fire tended and the breathing listened to and the sustained presence that said: someone is here.

The first time in months that I had done something for someone else.

The thought arrived and I dismissed it. But the fact remained: I was doing something for someone else. Mechanical, practical, actionless — but directed outward. Toward him. Toward his continued existence.

Hours passed. The fire consumed wood. I added more. The cycle — fire burns, fire diminishes, hand adds wood, fire grows — the cycle was care. Each addition was: I am keeping you warm. Each addition was: I am here.

He stirred once. Around midnight. A shift in his breathing — a deeper intake, immediately punished by the broken ribs, immediately abandoned. He shifted his weight and stopped and the stopping was the pain and the pain was: mine. I had caused it. Each breath he took was a breath through ribs that I had broken.

I checked the bandage. The bleeding had stopped. The laceration was clotting adequately. The arm — the reset joint — was swelling, the expected swelling after the reset. Normal. Functional.

I sat back.

The destroyed forest surrounded us. In the firelight, the downed trees cast long shadows. The stumps. The fissured ground. The circle of devastation with the fire at its center and the two people at the fire and the devastation: mine.

I did not think. That was the remarkable thing. No analysis. No pattern-recognition. No attempt to understand what the poison experiment had revealed. No headache, because no thought directed inward. Just: present. Here. The fire. His breathing.

No memory.

Nothing came. No recall triggered by sensation or environment. No past event overlaid on the present. The memory was: absent. Intentionally absent. Because the present was too full. The present was: watching him breathe.

The fire. The breathing. The night.

I did something I had not done in a long time: I listened to the silence. Not the absence-of-sound that accompanies solitude. The silence of being present with another person who is also silent. The shared silence. The breathing and the fire and the night sounds — insects, wind, the settling of fallen wood — and beneath all of it: the quiet.

Toward dawn, his breathing changed. Deeper. More regular. The transition from unconsciousness to natural sleep. The breathing of a body that was healing, that had turned the corner, that was: recovering.

He would live.

I knew it the way you know a patient has turned — the certainty that experience produced. He would live. The ribs would heal. The arm would recover. The laceration would scar. He would live and the living would be: in spite of me.

The fire burned low. I added the last of the pre-broken wood. Dawn arrived — the shift from firelight-warm to daylight-cool, the shadows shortening, the world returning to the visible.

I sat beside him. Two paces. Waiting for him to wake. Waiting for the moment when his eyes would open and he would see me and the destroyed forest and his own blood on my hands and the question would form:

What was that.

And I would have the answer. One word. True. Complete. The smallest and most devastating sentence I had ever spoken.

But not yet. He was sleeping. And I was watching. And the fire burned.

You were awake for most of it. You told me later. Every piece of wood. Every hour.
