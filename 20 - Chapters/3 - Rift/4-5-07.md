They came from two directions.

Eight. Not three. The count that indicated institutional commitment.

I registered them as cultivation signatures resolving from abstraction into presence. Southeast and northwest. Pincer formation. Professional. Planned.

Xu Ran felt them first.

"Eight," he said. Tightly. "Formation."

I turned toward them.

I wanted this.

The southeast group — four, emerging from the tree line in coordinated formation. They were equipped: spiritual weapons, qi-armor, practitioners who had been assigned a target and told the target was dangerous.

I moved.

The first cultivator's halberd came at me from the right. I went under it — millimeters. His halberd passed above me. My hand passed through his guard. The meridian junction was there. I touched it. His qi failed. He fell.

The second: simultaneously. Her sword — faster than the halberd. It came and I redirected it — not blocked, redirected. The sword moved and the person holding the sword moved with it and the woman fell.

Third. Fourth. The southeast group: disabled in what Xu Ran would later describe as "breathing twice."

The northwest group arrived as the southeast group went down. Four more. They had watched the first four fall. They adjusted: wider formation, greater distance.

It didn't matter.

I moved through them.

This was where the smile appeared.

I smiled. Not the careful kind. The real one — the one that used everything.

The fifth cultivator went down — meridian strike, clean, his body's qi-framework collapsing like a structure whose supports had been removed. The sixth: wrist-lock, rotational separation. The seventh: a touch. One finger on the chest. *I could destroy you and I am choosing not to.*

The smile widened.

The warmth came back. The old warmth, the one I remembered from battlefields.

The eighth cultivator — the last, the youngest, the one whose face showed what it looked like to watch seven colleagues incapacitated in the time it took to draw breath — looked at me. At the smile.

He ran. The correct decision.

I let him go.

My hand went to my mouth. Wiping.

The disgust that followed was not at them. At the warmth. At the pleasure. At the fact that the pleasure was genuine.

From the leader of the northwest group — disabled, on the ground, but conscious — I took something. A pendant that fell from his robe when he collapsed. Small. Metal. The metal was warm — warmer than it should have been, as if it held its own heat.

The pendant had marks. Insignia. The same marks I had seen on the first group's equipment. The same organization.

And a scratch. Recent. Added after the original inscription.

*The new one.*

I put the talisman in my robe.

Xu Ran stood at the clearing's edge. He had seen the smile.

"You enjoyed that," he said.

I didn't answer. There was nothing to say that he hadn't already written in his head.

He opened his notebook. He closed it. He opened it again.

He did not write.

This was the loudest thing Xu Ran had ever done.
