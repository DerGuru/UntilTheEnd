"You think you're like them," Xu Ran said.

We were camped by a river two days south of the library. Evening. The fire was small, adequate, built by someone who had stopped overthinking the arrangement of kindling. He sat with the scrolls spread around him like a scholar's nest: copies he'd made of the key passages, his own translations beside the originals, the whole thing organized by chronology because Xu Ran organized everything by chronology and I had stopped trying to convince him that time wasn't always the most useful axis.

"I know I'm like them," I said.

He set down his brush. He'd been reproducing a passage from the third scroll, the one about the world obeying, in cleaner characters, as archivists preserve texts by rewriting them.

"You know." Not a question. A confirmation.

"My qi obeys my will, not my technique. My body refuses to die. The world around me adjusts. Everything they documented — I experience. The difference is time."

"And the fact that you're still here."

"And that."

A log shifted in the fire. Sparks rose. The river made the sound that rivers make at night — darker somehow, more insistent, as if the water knows it's unwatched and relaxes into something less polished.

"You said the others were erased," he said. "Their memories. Their thoughts. The connections they were building."

"Their documentation ends. Mid-sentence. Mid-thought."

"And you think something, the same force that keeps you alive, something reached in and —"

"Folded the page. Yes."

He picked up his brush again. Set it down again. The cycle was familiar.

"I heard something else at the river," he said. "A trader mentioned Resonance Talismans. Old technique. Someone's been buying materials for them — rare components, the kind that haven't been in demand for centuries." He paused. "He said the buyer was meticulous. Took notes on everything."

I filed it. Didn't respond. Talismans were tools. Someone collecting tools didn't necessarily know what they were building.

"Then why hasn't it happened to you?"

This was the question. The one that had been following me since the first scroll, padding along behind my thoughts like an animal that had learned my route and could predict where I'd turn next. I'd been avoiding it with the dedication of someone avoiding a cliff edge in fog. Not by looking at it, but by feeling where the ground stopped being solid.

"I don't know," I said.

"Guess."

"I don't guess."

"Then hypothesize. You're a better scholar than you pretend to be."

That almost made me smile. Almost. The muscles twitched, the intention formed, and then the moment passed the way most of my moments passed — incomplete, halfway between feeling and expression, like a bird that lifts off the branch and settles back down.

"Hypothesis one," I said. "I'm stronger. The protection is identical in all of us, but mine is more robust. The erasure that stopped the others can't stop me."

"Problems?"

"The erasure appears to be part of the protection. One source. One signature. You don't outrun your own shadow."

"Hypothesis two."

"I'm different. Fundamentally. Whatever was in them is something else in me. Similar symptoms, different condition."

"Problems?"

"The qi signature is identical. Not similar. Identical."

"Hypothesis three."

I watched the fire. The flames were doing what flames do: consuming, transforming, converting one form of energy to another with beautiful, uncaring efficiency. There's a comfort in fire. In watching something that is entirely honest about what it does.

"The erasure hasn't happened to me yet," I said. "The others had years. Decades. Then they stopped. I've had millennia. But maybe that's not immunity. Maybe it's a longer wick."

He didn't write that down. He just looked at me. The firelight made his eyes darker than they were, or maybe that was the thought behind them, the calculation I could almost hear, the silent weighing of my words against the evidence.

"You're afraid," he said. Not unkindly.

"I'm aware."

"Of what? The erasure?"

"Of the possibility that I'm the one who causes it."

Silence.

The fire cracked. The river continued its dark, insistent monologue. A moth circled the flames — once, twice, three times — and then veered away into the dark with a wisdom that moths are not supposed to have.

"The qi under the ruins," Xu Ran said carefully. "Your signature."

"Yes."

"Laid down centuries before the buildings existed."

"Millennia, in most cases."

"And the researchers who studied those sites, the ones who documented the anomalies and then forgot, they were studying YOUR qi. Without knowing it."

"Yes."

"And you think something in that qi, in YOUR qi, detected that they were getting close to understanding it. And erased the thread."

"I think," I said, "that whatever keeps me alive is very good at ensuring it isn't understood. And the method it uses is forgetting. Other people's forgetting."

He was quiet for a long time. The fire shrank. I didn't add wood. Neither did he. The conversation had a weight that made practical tasks feel irrelevant.

"Your body does it," he said. "Not you. You said that. The instrument, not the musician."

"Yes."

"Maybe your body is wrong."

I looked at him.

"Maybe it's not your body," he said. "Maybe it IS you. And you don't remember because the same force that makes others forget is making YOU forget too. Not what you're investigating. What you're DOING."

The headache hit. A wave this time, not a spike. Slow, deep, the kind that starts at the base of the skull and rolls forward like a tide, pressing against the backs of my eyes, filling the space between thought and thought with a dull, insistent ache that wanted me to stop. To think about something else. To let this thread go the way thread is let go. By opening the hand.

I pressed my palms against my temples. Held.

The headache persisted, present enough to interfere but never quite enough to incapacitate. Like a hand on the shoulder that isn't pushing you away but is making sure you don't move forward.

"Yun?"

"I'm fine."

"You're pressing your head."

"I have a headache."

"Same kind as before?"

I lowered my hands. Opened my eyes. The fire had shrunk further. Xu Ran's face was half in shadow, half in dying light.

"Same kind as always," I said.

He looked at me for a long moment. Then he added wood to the fire. The flames caught. Light returned. The moth came back, or a different moth, indistinguishable from the first, circling with undiminished dedication.

"I'm going to write something in my notebook," he said. "And tomorrow you're going to let me keep the page."

I almost told him about the missing page. The one I'd torn out days ago, the folded summary pressed against my skin. Almost. The confession formed in my mouth like a shape trying to exist — syllables arranging themselves, the truth organizing itself into something speakable.

I swallowed it.

"Write what you want," I said.

He wrote. I watched the fire. The moth circled.

Tomorrow we would leave. There were more ruins, more sites, more threads to follow. But the library had given us what the library had to give — not answers, but the shape of the question. The outline of something vast and old and deeply, fundamentally wrong, drawn in the handwriting of six dead cultivators who had each, in their own way, gotten close enough to see the edge of the truth.

Six dead. One alive.

"Maybe," Xu Ran said, not looking up from his writing, "you're not different from them at all. Maybe all of them thought they were the exception. All of them kept searching. All of them were still asking questions right up until the moment they stopped."

I said nothing.

"And maybe," he said, "the difference between you and them is just time. You haven't stopped yet. But you will."

"Is that supposed to be comforting?"

"No." His pen scratched. "It's supposed to be a warning."

The fire burned. The river talked. The stars wheeled in their correct positions overhead, and I lay back on the ground and watched them turn, and thought about the six cultivators who had looked at these stars, from these hills, with those questions in their minds and that invisible hand on their shoulders.

And I thought about the fact that I could think about them at all. That the invisible hand hadn't yet closed around the thread of my investigation the way it had closed around theirs.

That word again — *still*. Heavy and provisional. Implying continuation without promising it.

I closed my eyes.
