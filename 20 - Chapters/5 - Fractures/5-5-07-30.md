I woke to the sound of Xu Ran breathing.

Not sleeping-breathing, the deep, even rhythm that I'd learned to identify over weeks of proximity. This was waking-breathing. Controlled. Deliberate. The breathing of a man who was lying in his bedroll with his eyes open, waiting for dawn to formalize what his body had already decided.

He'd been awake for a while. Hours, possibly. Lying in the dark, breathing carefully, thinking whatever thoughts a mortal thinks when he's spent the night three meters from something that can rewrite reality.

I didn't announce my waking. I lay still and watched the sky turn from black to the deep blue that precedes dawn, the blue that painters call impossible and mathematicians call transitional and I called the only honest color, the one that existed between definitions, between categories, neither night nor day, admitting to being neither.

The world looked wrong.

Not dramatically wrong. Not the obvious distortion of things broken or moved or missing. A subtler wrongness, the kind you notice in dreams, when the furniture is in the right place but the light falls from the wrong side and you know, without being able to explain, that you're not where you should be.

Colors were too much. The pre-dawn blue was too blue. The grey of the ashes in the fire pit was too precisely grey. The green of the pine needles, visible as shapes against the brightening sky, was the deliberate green of green things being green on purpose, as if the world had been told to be colorful and was trying too hard.

Shadows were wrong too. Correct in position. I checked, I tracked the angle of the emerging light against the objects that cast shadows, and the geometry was correct. But the shadows moved strangely. When I shifted my gaze, there was a delay, the shadow adjusting a fraction of a second after the light changed, as if it was referencing the light rather than responding to it. Checking notes. Making sure it was doing the shadow correctly before committing.

The world was self-correcting. Still absorbing what I'd done to it. Still fitting itself back into the shape of normal reality after eight minutes of being held in the shape of mine.

I sat up. The headache was there. Had been there, had been continuous since the field, a hot wire behind my eyes that pulsed with my heartbeat. I pressed my temples. Breathed. Stood.

Xu Ran was already up. Already packed. Already standing at the edge of our campsite with something in his hand that caught the early light with a thin metallic gleam.

A knife. The small utility blade he carried for cutting food, for trimming rope, for the mundane tasks that a mortal performs with tools because he doesn't have qi to do them without.

He was looking at his left hand. Specifically at his left index finger. His right hand held the knife against the pad of the finger, the blade's edge pressing just hard enough to dimple the skin without breaking it.

I watched. I didn't speak.

He cut. A small cut, precise, controlled, the deliberate incision of someone conducting an experiment. Blood appeared immediately, a thin red line, bright against the pale skin of his finger.

He stared at the blood.

Waited.

The blood didn't move. Didn't reverse. Didn't flow back into the wound through skin that rebuilt itself. It simply bled — the normal, expected, unremarkable bleeding that occurs when a blade breaks skin and capillaries release their contents according to the ordinary laws of biology.

Xu Ran exhaled. The exhalation was long and shaking and contained something I couldn't name. Not relief, not exactly, though relief was part of it. Something more complicated. The response of a person who has been afraid of something and has tested it and has found that the thing he was afraid of is not happening, and the confirmation of this is somehow worse than the fear, because the fear at least contained certainty.

He was relieved that the field was gone. And the relief was worse than the fear.

Because the fear had meant he was inside something terrible but functional. The relief meant he was back to fragile.

He put the knife away. Found a cloth in his pack, the same cloth he used for cleaning utensils, and wrapped his finger. The blood soaked through the fabric in a small, spreading stain that darkened and dried and looked exactly like what it was.

"It stays," he said.

"Yes."

"The field is gone."

"Yes."

He nodded. Tucked the wrapped finger against his palm. "Good."

The word was wrong. *Good* was a word for good things, and nothing about cutting your own finger to test whether reality was still broken qualified as good. But he'd said it, and I understood what he meant by it, which was: the wound is real. The blood is real. The damage is permanent. The world is back to being a place where things break and stay broken.

This was, somehow, preferable to the alternative.

We ate in the colors-too-bright morning. Rice, cold from last night, eaten with fingers because neither of us had bothered to heat water or clean bowls or perform any of the small rituals of preparation that made meals feel like meals instead of fuel. Xu Ran ate with his right hand. His left hand, the injured finger, rested on his knee.

The cut would scar. Barely. It was small, shallow, the kind of wound that heals in a week and leaves a thin white line that fades over months and years and eventually becomes invisible to everyone who isn't looking for it. But Xu Ran would look for it. I knew this. He would look at that scar the way soldiers look at their scars: not with pride, not with pain, but with the recognition of someone who survived something and needs the proof.

"The shadows are wrong," I said.

He looked at the ground. Looked at a tree. Looked at the angular shadow it cast against the brightening earth.

"Delayed," he said. He'd noticed. Of course he'd noticed. "By about a third of a second. As if they're being generated rather than cast."

Assessment. Precise. The scholar's reflex, converting observation into analysis, filing the impossible under *documented* and moving on.

"Will it stop?"

"I don't know."

He nodded. Ate more rice.

The world adjusted around us. I could feel it — small corrections, tiny shifts, the reality equivalent of a body settling after exertion. The colors were still too vivid, but less so than an hour ago. The shadows were still delayed, but the delay was shortening. By afternoon, perhaps, the world would look normal. By tomorrow, maybe it would be normal. The self-correction was happening, the way a lake returns to stillness after a stone, ripple by ripple, circle by circle, the disturbance propagating outward until it reaches the edges and dissipates.

Except I was still in the lake. And I was still a stone.

We packed. We walked.

The trail was there — still going east, still pulled by whatever internal compass had decided that isolation was the appropriate direction. I'd stopped fighting it. Not because I agreed, but because the alternatives — forcing south, wrestling with terrain that rearranged itself to prevent my passage, burning energy on a war with geography — were exhausting in a way that simple walking wasn't.

East. Into the mountains. Away from people who might be standing next to trees when I got angry.

We walked in silence. Not the usual silence, the comfortable absence of noise that traveling companions develop when they've been together long enough that conversation is optional. This was the other kind. The silence of people who have too much to say and no words adequate to say it.

I tried, once, to describe what the field had felt like from the inside. Tried to explain the sensation of locking reality — the weight of it, the pressure, the feeling of holding the entire world in a fixed shape through force of will and discovering that willpower was the wrong word because will implies choice and this had been automatic, reflexive, as unconscious as blinking.

The words died in my mouth. Not taken — not forgotten, not erased. Just insufficient. Language had been designed for human experiences, and what I'd done inside the field wasn't human. Not inhuman, either. Something else. Something that existed in a category that language hadn't been invented to describe.

Xu Ran listened to the silence. Then:

"You don't need to explain it."

"I want to."

"I know. But wanting to explain and being able to explain are different things. And forcing the explanation might —" He glanced at the nearest tree. The glance was involuntary, instinctive, the new reflex of a man who had learned to check whether the trees near him were intact.

Might break something. Might cost something. Might translate the frustration of inadequate language into the force of splitting wood.

I shut my mouth. We walked.

By midday, the colors had settled. The shadows were tracking correctly. The world had finished its adjustments, had accepted the eight-minute interruption, had filed it away the way the earth files away earthquakes: damage noted, stability restored, history continuing.

But underneath the surface, something had shifted. I could feel it. The bedrock. The deep structure. The relationship between what I was and what the world was, the negotiation between my interior and the external, the contract that governed which of my emotions became force and which stayed private.

The contract had been rewritten. The terms were worse.

And somewhere behind me — twenty kilometers, fifty, a hundred — the Pencil was writing a report. About me. About the field. About mercy.

His brush moved. The ink dried. The report would outlast us both.
