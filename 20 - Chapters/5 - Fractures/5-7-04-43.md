The village appeared on the third day of walking.

Small. A crossroads settlement — the kind of place that exists because two trails meet and people who travel need to eat and sleep and buy things they forgot to bring. A market square that was more of a market rectangle. Thirty buildings, maybe forty, clustered around the intersection with the pragmatic density of structures built for function rather than aesthetics.

People.

The first people who weren't cultivators or companions in weeks. The first people who didn't know what I was, who didn't carry talismans or instruments or the professional wariness of those who monitored reality anomalies for a living. These were farmers. Traders. The woman who sold vegetables from a stall she'd set up since before dawn. The old man who sharpened tools at the corner of the intersection. The children who moved between adults with the purposeful aimlessness of small humans performing the important work of being young.

I walked among them and felt everything.

The new sensitivity made the village overwhelming. Not dangerously — not the way cultivation energy or combat or the field had been overwhelming. The mundane, detailed, sensory overwhelm of a person experiencing normal life at full volume for the first time. The smell of cooking fires — distinct, individual, each one carrying the flavor of whatever was being cooked in whatever pot with whatever fuel. The sound of voices — conversations overlapping, laughter, argument, the bass murmur of commerce and the treble clarity of children. The texture of the market square underfoot — packed earth, worn smooth by generations of feet, each step transmitting the information of density and moisture and the history of a surface that had been walked on ten thousand times.

Too much. But manageable. The way a new language is too much — the brain objecting to the volume of input while simultaneously learning to process it.

Xu Ran was in his element. Markets were his natural ground, the place where he moved best. He moved through the stalls with the efficient purposefulness of a man who had been making lists in his head for days and was now ready to act. Rice. Dried vegetables. A spool of heavy thread for mending. Salt.

I bought fruit. A basket of small, hard pears from a woman whose stall was organized with the military precision of someone who took produce seriously. She counted my coins — copper, the small denominations that moved in rural marketplaces — and frowned.

"You're three short," she said.

I counted again. She was right. The sum was wrong — three coins fewer than it should have been, the math failing in the way that math shouldn't fail when you've counted twice and the amount in your hand is the amount you took from your pouch.

"Sorry." I found the additional coins. Paid.

The pears were beautiful. Smooth-skinned, green-gold, the variety that grows in mountain valleys and carries the altitude in its flesh — dense, firm, sweet in the way that things are sweet when sweetness has to be earned from thin soil and cold nights.

I bit into one. The flesh inside was brown. Mealy. Rotted from the center outward, the exterior perfect and the interior past salvage.

I looked at it. The brown flesh, the untouched skin. Perfect outside. Ruined inside.

There was a metaphor there that I was not in the mood for.

I threw it away. Tried another. Also brown. A third. Brown.

Three pears. Three perfect exteriors. Three rotten interiors. The probability of this — randomness selecting three bad fruits from a basket of thirty — was low enough to be suspicious and high enough to be deniable. The debt operated in exactly this range. Never impossible. Never dramatic. Just persistent, nagging, the steady erosion of probability in my disfavor.

Xu Ran found me by the fabric stall. He was holding his outer robe — my outer robe, technically, the one I'd been wearing since the clearing — and discussing repairs with the vendor. A tear in the shoulder seam. Simple work for someone with the right tools.

The vendor took the outer robe. Threaded a needle. Made three precise stitches.

The thread snapped.

New thread. New stitches. Snap.

Third attempt. Heavier thread. Slower stitches. The needle went in, the thread pulled through, the seam began to close.

The fabric tore. Along a different seam. A new tear, two centimeters from the repair, opening with the quiet sound of material giving up.

The vendor stared at the outer robe. At Xu Ran. At the outer robe again. The expression of a professional encountering a failure that couldn't be explained by skill or materials or any of the variables that professionals control.

"I'll try—"

"Don't," Xu Ran said. He took the outer robe back. Folded it. The tear was visible — a thin line of separation in the grey fabric, another entry in the growing catalogue of small things going wrong.

He looked at me. I looked at the rotten pears in the waste pile. The connection was clear — the same debt, the same slow extraction, the same precise and impersonal ledger that took what it was owed in installments small enough to be individually trivial and collectively significant.

We ate lunch at a stall. Rice and braised greens, the kind of simple food that exists in small markets because complexity requires time and ingredients and a settled kitchen. The food was adequate. Warm. Real in the way that market food is real — made by a person, for a person, in the transaction of nourishment for currency that has been the foundation of civilization since civilization decided to have a foundation.

The greens were slightly bitter. Not wrong — just the slightly-too-much edge of vegetables that had been stored a day too long. The rice was fine. The rice was always fine. Rice was apparently beneath the debt's notice, or the debt had a sense of proportion that I didn't fully credit it for.

I ate. Xu Ran ate. The fox-spirit waited at the market's edge, unwilling to enter the human space, watching with amber eyes from the shadow of a storage building.

After lunch, we walked through the market again. Xu Ran bought salt. I bought nothing — the rotten pears had exhausted my interest in retail. We moved between stalls and between people and between conversations that meant nothing to us and everything to the people having them, the privacy of public spaces where nobody looks at you because nobody has reason to.

The child appeared at the market's edge.

Small — six, maybe seven, the age where children are fully mobile but not fully socialized, old enough to navigate a crowd independently and young enough to not understand why adults don't say the things that are obviously true.

She was looking at me. The unblinking, uncomfortably direct look of a child who has noticed something and hasn't yet learned that noticing things is supposed to be discreet.

I noticed her noticing me. Looked away. Looked back. She was still looking.

She walked over. Not hesitantly — directly, with the efficient trajectory of someone who has identified a destination and is going there. She stopped two meters from me. Looked up.

"Why are you so sad?" she asked.

The question was simple. Clear. Delivered with the tonal certainty of children, who ask real questions and expect real answers because they haven't yet learned that most questions are rhetorical and most answers are evasive.

"I'm not sad," I said.

"Yes you are."

Three words. No argument. No qualification. The flat, irrefutable assertion of someone who sees what they see and has no reason to doubt it. Children are mirrors — they reflect what's in front of them without distortion, without interpretation, without the layers of social courtesy that adults apply to perception.

This child saw sadness.

I wasn't sad. At least — I didn't think I was sad. I felt the crack. I felt the cold. I felt the nameless frequency in my chest and the heightened sensitivity of a world with its volume turned up. But sadness — the identifiable emotion of sadness — wasn't on my list. Wasn't in my inventory. Wasn't part of the conditions as I understood them.

But the child saw it. And children don't see things that aren't there. They see things that adults have learned to not see, things that exist below the threshold of acknowledged experience, things that the thick armor of adult awareness keeps out because keeping out is easier than feeling.

Was I sad?

The crack pulsed. The feeling hummed. Somewhere deep, beneath the wall, beneath the guardian, beneath the new gentle warning that had replaced the old brutal deletion — somewhere, something ached with the quality of loss.

I didn't know what I'd lost. The content was gone. The memory was gone. The wall had seen to that.

But the sadness remained.

"I don't know why," I said to the child. The honesty surprised me. Not the habit of honesty — the targeted honesty of admitting to a six-year-old that her observation was correct and my denial was wrong.

She tilted her head. The gesture of a child turning over an answer that doesn't fit the expected format.

Xu Ran's hand on my shoulder. Gentle. "Come on," he said.

I let him guide me away. Away from the child, away from the mirror, away from the simple question that had cut deeper than any cultivation technique because cultivation techniques aimed at the surface and this question had aimed at the truth.

The child waved. The small, casual wave of someone who has said what they wanted to say and is done.

I didn't wave back. I should have. But my hands were at my sides and my chest was full of something that might have been sadness and might have been the feeling and might have been both, layered on top of each other, indistinguishable.

You never mentioned the child. But you walked closer after that. Not inside the three meters. Closer to them.

We left the market. The fox-spirit rejoined us at the village edge, emerging from shadow like a thought returning after a distraction. The trail was there — east, still, always east.

The child's question followed me for hours. Not in my thoughts — the wall didn't take it, didn't classify it as dangerous, let it circulate freely in my consciousness like a leaf on water. In my body. In the chest. In the place where the feeling lived and the sadness that I hadn't known about lived and all the accumulated weight of unnamed loss pressed against the inside of my ribs like hands against glass.

Why are you so sad.

I didn't have an answer.

The crack pulsed. The feeling hummed. The world was sharp and loud and cold and detailed and full of children who saw things that adults couldn't see.

We walked east. The village disappeared behind us. The mountains received us. And the sadness — unacknowledged, unnamed, undeniable — came with us.
