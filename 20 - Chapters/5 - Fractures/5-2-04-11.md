The paper of the fourth scroll triggered it — the texture under my fingertips. Thinner than the rest. Almost soft, the fibers separating after millennia into something like cloth. My thumb traced a line of faded characters, and the sensation sent something through my skin before the meaning registered.

*Return.* Or more precisely, the archaic form of *return* — a character that combined the symbols for *circle* and *self*, implying not physical return but a coming-back-to-what-one-was. The word sat in a sentence I'd been parsing for context when the world tilted.

Not physically. Not the ruin, not the ground, not the shelves. The world inside my skull. A lurch — the same sensation as missing a step on a staircase, when your body braces for impact that doesn't come and the wrongness rings through your bones.

A flash. Not light. Image.

Me. Somewhere else. Somewhere old — older than this library, older than the scrolls, older than the language they were written in. Stone under my hands, warm. Not cold — warm, the way stone is warm when someone has been sitting against it. My fingers tracing lines in the surface. The same motion I'd been making here, in this ruin, for the past two days. Tracing grooves. Reading with my hands instead of my eyes.

The image lasted three heartbeats. Maybe four. Long enough to smell something that wasn't chalk or incense but earth — rich, wet, recently turned, the smell of a place where things grow.

Then it was gone.

The scroll fell from my hands. I watched it land — the paper folding in on itself, the roll settling into the dust like a body settling into sleep. Slow. Gentle. The kind of falling that doesn't want to cause damage.

My hands were shaking.

Not from the scrolls. Not from what they said or what they meant. From the image. From the stone under my hands. From the knowledge — not intellectual, not deduced, but body-knowledge, bone-knowledge — that the image was real. That I had been in that place, doing that thing, touching that stone. That something in me remembered an act I had no memory of performing.

Xu Ran appeared. He picked up the scroll. Wiped the dust off with the careful attention of someone who understands that old things deserve gentleness regardless of their content. He looked at my face.

He didn't ask.

That was new. The Xu Ran of six months ago would have asked. Would have pressed. Would have followed the question until it either yielded an answer or yielded frustration, because that was what scholars did — they pushed at the borders of not-knowing until not-knowing gave up and let them in.

This Xu Ran looked at my face and saw something there — I don't know what; I don't know what my face does when the world inside my skull tilts — and chose silence. He set the scroll back in its place. He left the room. A minute later, I heard the sound of water being poured and a fire being stoked.

I stared at my hands. The warmth was gone. The stone under my palms was cold — ruin-cold, dead-cold, the temperature of abandonment. But for three heartbeats, it had been real.

Somewhere, millennia ago, I had sat against that stone and traced lines with my fingers and known what I was doing.

I pushed myself up. My knees cracked — which was ridiculous, because my body didn't crack, didn't creak, didn't age in the ways that bodies are supposed to age. The sound was real though. The body remembering what it was supposed to be, the way a river remembers its old course even when the banks have shifted.

Outside, the evening was cool and smelled of pine. Xu Ran had tea going. Not cooking — just tea, the kind of gesture that means *I know you need something and food isn't it.* The water steamed. He poured without asking. I took the cup without commenting.

You learned when not to ask faster than I learned when to answer.

We sat on the slope below the library entrance, looking out across the valley. The view was wide — folded hills, strips of forest, a river in the distance catching the last light. Normal landscape. Normal composition of stone and water and wood. I checked each element against my memory and found no discrepancies.

The tea was bitter. Properly bitter. Not over-steeped — just a leaf variety that had no interest in being pleasant. I drank it.

"The fourth scroll," Xu Ran said.

"Yes."

"Something in it."

"A word."

"What word?"

"Return." I held the cup in both hands. The warmth was comfort I wasn't willing to acknowledge. "The old form. Circle-self. The kind of return that means coming back to what you were."

"And?"

"And something — happened. A flash. An image. Me, somewhere else, a very long time ago. Doing what I'm doing here. Reading stone."

He was quiet for a long time. The tea cooled. The valley darkened. Stars appeared — correct stars, in the right positions, which I confirmed with the patient attention of someone who no longer takes the sky for granted.

"A memory?" he said.

"Not one I have. One my body has."

He processed that. I could see the pieces settling — not metaphorically; Xu Ran's thinking had a quality of physical motion, a shifting behind the eyes that tracked through disbelief and analysis and arrived, eventually, at the kind of acceptance that scholars reach when the evidence is clear enough to overcome preference.

"Your body remembers things your mind doesn't," he said.

"Yes."

"From when?"

"I don't know. The image had no context. Just sensation. Stone. My hands moving."

"Moving how?"

"The way they move here. The same motion. Tracing lines."

He set down his cup. Picked up his notebook. Set the notebook down. He was trying not to ask the question I could see forming — the question that was too big and too dangerous and would, once asked, create an obligation to answer that neither of us was ready for.

He asked it anyway.

"How old are you?"

I drank the last of the tea. Bitter. Sharp. Real.

"Older than I thought."

He waited for more. I didn't give more. That was enough truth for one evening — maybe too much. The age question was a door I'd been walking past for centuries, and opening it meant seeing a hallway so long the other end was just darkness.

The stars turned. The valley fell into complete shadow. Somewhere in the library, a shelf settled, and the sound of wood and stone adjusting themselves to the absence of human activity was so familiar that I almost smiled.

Almost.

"We leave tomorrow," I said. "There's nothing more here that the scrolls can tell us."

"What can they tell us?"

"That six others had what I have. That all six were erased. That whatever is doing this has been doing it for at least five thousand years." I set the empty cup on the stone. "And that it keeps doing it."

"To everyone except you."

"So far."

He picked up his notebook. This time he wrote. The pen moved with the measured certainty of someone recording a fact he wishes weren't one.

I went inside. Found the most intact corner. Lay down on the stone floor with my robe bunched under my head and my eyes on the ceiling, where a crack in the rock let in a single star.

The star was in the right place.

Everything was in the right place.

Except me.
