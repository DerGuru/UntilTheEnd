Xu Ran fell asleep first. He always did — the disciplined sleep of someone who believes that rest is a tactical decision, not a biological weakness. His breathing evened. His hand, which had been resting on his notebook, relaxed. The pen rolled free and settled against a root.

I stayed awake.

The last scroll was the oldest. I'd been saving it — not consciously, not deliberately, but with the instinct of someone who knows that the final piece of evidence will either confirm or collapse the structure they've been building, and neither outcome is comfortable.

I unrolled it by firelight. The paper was impossibly thin — translucent almost, the characters visible from both sides like shadows trapped between layers of glass. The ink had aged to a deep bronze that caught the light with an almost metallic sheen.

Old. Older than old. This was pre-written-history old, the kind of document that shouldn't exist because the civilization that produced it had left no other records, no buildings, no evidence of having existed at all beyond this single scroll sealed in a stone cylinder in a library that had been forgotten before most current nations had been founded.

The first lines were observational. Precise, almost austere:

*Forty-three deviations in fourteen lunar cycles. The qi responds before I act. The world adjusts to accommodate my presence. I have documented each instance. They are consistent.*

Forty-three deviations. Fourteen cycles. A pace that made my fourteen anomalies in three weeks look leisurely.

I read on. The cultivator — the oldest voice in the collection, the first to notice what I was noticing — had been thorough. More thorough than the others. The documentation was dense, systematic, the work of someone who had approached mystery with the tools of science rather than the reflexes of superstition.

*I have concluded that the source is internal. The deviations correlate with my emotional state, my physical position, and most critically, my intentions. When I intend to go somewhere, the path adjusts. When I wish for rain, the clouds shift. When I expect safety, threats diminish. The causality is reversed: the world does not shape my experience — my experience shapes the world.*

My hands tightened on the scroll.

*I have further concluded that this effect is not voluntary. I have attempted to control it. I cannot. The adjustments occur below consciousness, below intention, in a stratum of will so deep that the concept of "choice" does not apply. It is as automatic as breathing. As involuntary as a heartbeat. And as impossible to stop.*

I set the scroll on my knee. The fire was dying. Xu Ran breathed.

The cultivator's words were my words. Not in the metaphorical sense — not in the sense that we shared experiences or perspectives or philosophies. In the literal sense. These were things I could have written, in this order, with this logic, arriving at these conclusions through these steps. The thinking was mine. The structure was mine. The way the mind moved from observation to hypothesis to conclusion — that architecture of reasoning — was so familiar that reading it felt less like discovery and more like remembering.

I read the final section.

*The question is not what I am. The question is what happens when I understand what I am. I have observed a pattern: the closer I come to comprehension, the more the world resists. Not externally — internally. My thoughts scatter. My focus breaks. I reach for the conclusion and find my hand empty, my mind blank, my notes unreadable.*

*Something does not want me to know.*

*I am not certain it is something external. I am increasingly certain it is me.*

The scroll ended. Same as all the others. No final character. No conclusion. Just the last word, *me,* hanging in the silence like a note held past the end of a song.

*Me.*

I rolled the scroll. Slowly. The paper was so old that haste would destroy it, and this scroll — this voice from the deepest past — deserved care. It deserved to be held gently, the way you hold something that has traveled farther than you thought objects could travel and arrived intact.

I placed it back in the cylinder. Sealed it. Set it beside the others in the pile that Xu Ran had organized by chronology, and it sat at the bottom, the foundation, the oldest voice in a chorus of voices that all said the same thing:

*I am the source. And something in me does not want me to know.*

Outside, the rain began.

Not gently — all at once, the way mountain weather decides: not a transition but a declaration. One moment dry. The next, a curtain of water so dense the fire hissed and failed in seconds.

Xu Ran woke. Rolled over. Pulled his blanket over his head. Went back to sleep with the unperturbed efficiency of someone who has categorized rain under *problems that are not mine.*

I stood.

The rain hit my face and I let it. The water was cold — not unpleasant cold, not the dead cold of metal fittings, but alive cold, the temperature of clouds and altitude and the indifference of weather to human affairs. It ran down my skin under my robe, soaked through fabric that should have repelled it — cultivators at my level don't get wet, not involuntarily, the qi forms a barrier as natural and unconscious as blinking.

I let the barrier drop.

Deliberately. The way you open a window when the room is stale — not because you want the cold but because you need the air. The qi shield dissolved and the rain arrived, full and heavy and real, soaking through cloth to skin, through skin to muscle, through muscle to bone.

I stood in it.

The water ran down my face like something being washed away. My hair plastered to my skull. My robe became a second skin, dark and heavy, clinging to shoulders and arms and the architecture of a body that had existed for longer than it had any right to.

I wanted to feel this.

Not the numbness. Not the efficiency. Not the cold distance that had carried me through three weeks of ruins and scrolls and evidence that pointed at a truth so large that looking at it was like looking at the sun — possible, briefly, before the body's own defenses shut it down.

I wanted to feel the rain. The cold. The heaviness. The way water insists on going down, on finding the lowest point, on obeying a gravity that has nothing to do with will or intention or the deep, unconscious workings of whatever I was.

The rain didn't care about me. That was the point. Everything else — the qi, the world, the paths that bent, the forests that grew where clearings had been — everything else responded to me, adjusted for me, obeyed without being asked. The rain didn't. The rain was just water. It fell because falling is what water does, not because something in my bones wished it so.

I tilted my face up. Opened my eyes. The sky was black and close and featureless, and the rain fell from it like a curtain between the world and whatever lay above the world, and for a moment — one moment — I wasn't a cultivator or a mystery or a source.

I was just wet.

A puddle formed at my feet. The water collected in a depression in the rock, shallow and clear, and my face appeared in it — not because I looked for it, but because water does what water does. Forms surfaces. Reflects.

I saw myself. Distorted by raindrops. Each drop that hit the surface broke my face apart — fragmented it, scattered me into circles of ripple and reformation, and each time I came back together I was slightly different, slightly reassembled, a mosaic version of myself that the rain kept breaking and remaking.

A raindrop hit the center of my reflection. My face dissolved.

I looked away.

The rain continued. I stood in it until the cold reached my bones — actually reached them, not metaphorically, not the way cultivators use the word bones to mean something spiritual, but actually cold, actually deep, actually affecting tissue that hadn't been affected by anything external in centuries.

Then I went back inside. Water pooling at my feet. Dripping from my sleeves. The scroll cylinders sat in their neat row, untouched by rain, protected by the overhang and by whatever small mercy the ruins still offered.

Xu Ran was still asleep. His blanket had slipped. I pulled it back over his shoulder without thinking about it.

You were awake. You told me later. You felt the blanket and stayed still, and you thought: *she doesn't know she does that.* You were right.

The rain fell.

I sat in the dark, wet and cold and alive, and thought about five thousand years of cultivators who had stood where I stood, asked what I asked, and then forgotten.

The question crystallized. Not new — it had been forming since the first scroll. But now it had edges. Now it had weight.

*If others had what I have, and they all died — why am I still here?*

Not stronger. The qi was the same. Not different. The experience was identical. Not luckier. I didn't believe in luck.

Then why?

I sat with the question. The rain answered nothing. The dark answered nothing. Xu Ran's breathing answered nothing.

But the question was mine now. Solid. Heavy. Real.

And whatever it was that kept stopping questions — whatever invisible hand had folded those pages shut, mid-sentence, mid-thought, mid-character — it hadn't stopped this one.

Not yet.
