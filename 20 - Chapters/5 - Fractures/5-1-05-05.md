"You're searching for something," Xu Ran said. "Concrete. What?"

We were resting by a stream four days past the library. He'd built a fire with the efficient, unsentimental competence of someone who'd done it enough times that it no longer felt like a skill and had started feeling like breathing. The pot was already on, water slowly coming to a boil. He cut something — root vegetable, the kind that looks like a mistake until you cook it — into pieces that were almost uniform.

He was better at this than me. Always had been. I could unmake a mountain but I'd overcook rice. The irony didn't escape me. It rarely did.

"Me," I said.

He stopped cutting. Looked up. The knife hovered over the root, a bead of moisture running down the flat of the blade.

"You."

"Me."

"That's not — " He caught himself. Set the knife down. Picked up a different question. "What does that mean, specifically?"

"Specifically." I watched the stream. It moved the way streams should — downhill, clear, cold from the mountain. Normal. The most normal thing I'd seen in weeks, and I was grateful for it in a way I couldn't have explained. "I'm looking for the places where I show up. In the world. The marks I've left. The impressions."

"Everyone leaves marks."

"Not like this."

He waited. Patient. His patience had improved — or rather, his ability to disguise his impatience had improved, which served just as well if you didn't look closely. I looked closely. I saw the micro-tension in his jaw, the slight forward lean, the way his fingers found his notebook without his eyes guiding them.

"The shrine had qi older than the building," I said. "The library too. Matching signature. The path we walked should have gone through a valley. There's a plateau instead."

"People's memories of terrain can be — "

"Mine can't."

He opened his mouth. Closed it. He'd been traveling with me long enough to know: when I stated something about my memory with that flatness, arguing was like pushing against a mountain with your palms. The mountain didn't care about your palms.

"All right," he said. "Your memory is accurate. The terrain changed. What does that have to do with searching for you?"

I picked up a pebble from the stream bank. Smooth. Grey. Cold in the way that water-touched stone is cold — clean cold, not the dead cold of the shrine's fittings. I turned it in my fingers.

"Everything I've found so far has one thing in common. The qi that doesn't belong — the qi that's too old, too deep, too embedded in the stone to have gotten there naturally — it matches mine."

He stopped breathing for about three seconds. Then resumed. To his credit, that was the only visible reaction.

"Similar how?"

"In every way that counts. Same shape. Same pattern. Same source."

"You're saying you left those qi traces."

"I'm saying something with my signature left them. Centuries before the buildings existed. In stone that was bare ground at the time."

He thought about that. The water boiled. He added the root vegetables mechanically, his body performing the task while his mind was elsewhere.

"And the terrain changes? The path, the valley?"

I threw the pebble back. It hit the water and sank without a sound worth noting.

"I don't know yet."

That was true. I didn't know. I suspected, and suspicion is not knowledge, and I was not yet ready to cross the space between them. The space was dark and the crossing would cost something I wasn't sure I could afford.

He pushed a bowl toward me. I looked at it. He waited.

I ate.

Not because I was hungry. Not because the food deserved to be eaten, though it did — he'd seasoned it with something green and peppery he'd found by the stream, and it was better than it had any right to be. I ate because he'd prepared it, and refusing it had started to feel like a different kind of cruelty than the kinds I was used to.

The stream talked to itself. Wind moved through the trees — from the east, correct direction, correct force, and I noted the correctness the way you note a friend's face in a crowd of strangers.

"How many anomalies so far?" he asked.

"Seven."

"Seven in — "

"Twelve days."

He wrote it down. I watched his hand move, the pen precise, the characters aligned. He dated the entry. Location. Conditions. A brief description in shorthand I couldn't read from this distance and didn't need to.

"What does 'similar to yours' mean in terms of — " He hesitated. Xu Ran didn't often hesitate. "In terms of scale? Is it a trace? A mark? Or — "

"A foundation."

"A foundation."

"The qi under these sites isn't residual. It's structural. It's load-bearing. As if someone — something — laid down a layer of energy and everything else was built on top of it. The buildings, the roads, the geography." I paused. "The geography, Xu Ran."

He understood. I could see the moment it landed — a micro-flinch, quickly suppressed, the kind of involuntary reaction that happens when you realize the problem is larger than you'd estimated. Not a little larger. Categorically larger. The difference between a crack in a wall and a crack in a foundation.

"You're saying the landscape itself — "

"I'm saying I need to see more."

He heard the deflection. Accepted it. This was the dance we'd developed — I would approach a truth, get close enough to feel its heat, then step back. He would note the temperature and the distance and the direction, and file it, and wait. Neither of us called it what it was. Calling it something would have required discussing why I kept stepping back, and discussing that would have required facing the fact that stepping back wasn't caution.

It was fear.

Not of what I'd find. Of what it would mean about what I'd already done.

I stood. Stretched. The headache was there again — not sharp this time, but present, a dull weight behind my eyes that came and went with no pattern I could detect. It had started at the shrine and had been coming more frequently since. I rubbed my temple. The motion was becoming a habit, which worried me. Habits are the body's way of telling you that a temporary problem has become a permanent one.

"Next site?" he asked.

"South. Two days. A meditation cave complex."

"You've been there?"

"Once. A long time ago."

"Will it be where you remember?"

I looked at him. He looked back. The question was more than geographic, and we both knew it.

"We'll see," I said.

I didn't sleep well that night. The ground was comfortable enough — I've slept on worse, I've slept on everything — but my mind wouldn't settle. It kept returning to the inscriptions in the library. The researcher who'd been cataloguing those anomalies. The abrupt end of their work.

What had stopped them?

I turned onto my back. The stars through the canopy were distant and indifferent.

Death was the obvious answer. Death stopped most things. But the inscriptions hadn't ended with violence — no scorch marks, no structural damage, no signs of combat. They'd ended with silence. A character half-formed. A thought half-finished. As if the person had simply — stopped. Walked away. Forgotten what they were doing.

Forgotten.

The headache spiked. I pressed my fist against my forehead.

*Not yet.*

The thought came from somewhere deep — deeper than thinking, deeper than deciding. A reflex. A gate slamming shut before I'd had time to see what was behind it.

I lay in the dark and listened to Xu Ran breathe. Slow. Even. The sound of someone who trusted the world enough to sleep in it.

I envied that.

I didn't envy much.
