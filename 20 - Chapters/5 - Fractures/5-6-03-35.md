He took me to the clearing.

It was the one he'd found — open, wide, treeless in the center, the kind of space that exists in mountains when a flat shelf of rock lies close enough to the surface that soil never accumulated deeply enough for large growth. Grass, short and wind-flattened. Small stones. The horizon in all directions, the sky pressing down with the leaden weight of high altitude.

I noticed the absence of trees. Noticed the openness. Didn't think about why he'd chosen this place, or why the first thing my eyes did was measure the distance to the nearest significant structure — a boulder field, forty meters north — and find it adequate.

Adequate for what, I didn't ask myself.

We stopped in the center. The grass was dry beneath our feet. Morning light, low and angular, casting shadows too long for the objects that made them.

Xu Ran put his pack down. Removed the things he normally carried close — the water flask, the small knife, the fire steel. Set them on the ground, five meters away, with the deliberate placement of someone clearing a workspace.

Then he stood facing me. Five meters between us.

The distance was new. Not the traveling distance, not the companionable three meters. Five. The extra two meters were intentional, calculated, the space between a man and something that might react.

"I need to ask you a question," he said.

His voice was steady. His hands were not. They hung at his sides, and the tremor was visible — not the gross shaking of fear but the fine vibration of controlled tension, the body's protest against a mind that had decided to override its survival instincts.

"Then ask."

I said it simply. Openly. The way you say things to someone you trust, someone who has walked beside you through rain you created and earthquakes you caused and the absence of mountains you erased. Someone who had stood in your grief, literally, and hadn't moved.

I trusted him entirely.

He knew this. It was written on his face — not the knowledge itself but the weight of it, the quiet agony of a man who was about to use someone's trust as a weapon against them because the weapon was necessary and the target was behind walls that nothing else could breach.

"It's going to hurt," he said.

Not a warning. An apology, offered in advance, for a wound he was about to inflict deliberately.

"It's always hurting," I said.

He closed his eyes. Opened them. His jaw worked, the motion of someone biting down on the last chance to stop, chewing it, swallowing it.

"Yun."

"Yes."

He looked at me. The look was the look of a man standing at the edge of something irreversible, the moment before the stone is dropped and the ripples begin and everything downstream changes.

"Have you killed Wei?"

The clearing was silent.

Not quiet — silent. The absolute, crystalline silence of a space from which all sound had been removed, as if the air itself had stopped carrying vibrations, as if the molecules between us had agreed to hold still, as if the world had decided that this moment deserved the absence of everything except the words that had been spoken.

Have you killed Wei.

Not *did she die* or *was it your fault* or *do you feel responsible*. Questions that would have engaged the mind, that would have been processed intellectually, that would have been intercepted by the wall and erased before they could reach the place where they needed to land.

Have YOU killed Wei.

Second person. Active voice. Direct accusation. A blade. Clean. Sharp. Aimed at the one point where the armor didn't cover.

Nothing landed.

For one second, one actual, measurable second, the kind that clocks count and hearts beat through, my body registered nothing. A blank. As if the question had hit a surface so fundamental that the impact hadn't registered yet, the way there's a delay between a deep cut and the pain, between the blade and the bleeding.

Then the defense activated.

It rose: the wall, the guardian, whatever lived below consciousness and above consent. It came up like a tide, like a wave, like a structure being built at impossible speed. NO. The word — not spoken, not thought, existing in a space between language and reflex — was absolute. NO. The wall was going to take this. Was going to erase this. Was going to remove the question and the answer and the entire experience of standing in this clearing facing this man who had just asked the worst possible thing.

The wall was going to protect me from the truth.

But Xu Ran hadn't asked me to think.

He'd asked me to feel.

And the feeling, the thing that lived below the wall, below the defense, in the deep architecture where emotion existed without content and affect existed without cause: the feeling had already arrived. Before the wall could close. Before the guardian could intervene. Before the deepest defense could identify the threat and silence it.

The feeling had arrived, and it had a shape. The shape was the answer to the question, and the answer was—

A crack.

Not in the ground. Not in the air. Not in any external surface. Inside. In the wall. In the defense. A single, thin, hair-fine crack, running from wherever the feeling had landed to wherever the surface was, propagating through the structure of my self-protection with the quiet inexorability of ice in stone.

The crack was small. It was enough.

Through the crack, for one second, I saw everything.
