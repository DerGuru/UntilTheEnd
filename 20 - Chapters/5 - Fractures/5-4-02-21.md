He drew in the sand beside the fire.

Lines. Circles. Arrows. The visual language of someone who thinks in structure and needs structure to be seen before it can be believed. He started with our route — the spiral, the tightening path — and then he added the anomaly markers, each one numbered, each one dated.

"Here," he said, tapping the first marker. "The shrine. Qi flowing toward you. Foundation layer with your signature." He moved to the second. "The library. Same foundation. Same signature. Researcher documented the same phenomena — three thousand years ago." Third. "The caves. Same. Fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh — same. Every site, same qi signature. Same age pattern. Same ending for the researchers."

He drew a line connecting them. Then another. Then a circle around the center of the spiral.

"The anomalies correlate with your presence. Not perfectly — the timing has a delay, the radius varies. But the correlation is there. You've documented it yourself. Fourteen anomalies in three weeks, all centered on your route."

I watched his hands. They moved with clarity. Each line deliberate, each symbol chosen.

"The historical fragments confirm it. Six cultivators, five thousand years, identical description: qi that obeys will, not technique. Bodies that refuse to die. Reality that adjusts to accommodate their existence." He paused. "And all six erased. Mid-thought. Mid-sentence."

He looked at me.

"You change reality," he said. "The anomalies aren't random — they're consequences. Every time you move through the world, you edit it. Retroactively. The paths that shift, the forests that grow, the terrain that rearranges itself — it's not happening TO you. It's happening BECAUSE of you. The chalk test proved it. Your handwriting on a mark I made. Your qi signature under ruins that predate you by centuries."

He drew a final line. From the spiral's center outward, radiating like spokes of a wheel.

"And whatever is doing this — whatever adjusts reality, whatever protects you, whatever erased those six researchers — it's not external. It's in you. It IS you. A part of you that operates below consciousness, below choice, below everything you think of as yourself."

His voice was calm. Scholarly. The voice of someone presenting a thesis they've stress-tested against every objection they could think of and found intact.

I listened.

I understood.

Every word. Every connection. Every line in the sand. The pattern was there — I could see it, could trace the logic, could feel the truth of it sitting in my chest like a stone dropped in water, settling, finding the bottom.

I nodded.

"Yes," I said.

His shoulders dropped. Relief — visible, physical, the accumulated tension of someone who has been building toward this moment for weeks and wasn't certain it would arrive.

"So what do we —"

I blinked.

Not the blink of dry eyes. The blink of transition — the moment when one state becomes another, the way a reflection in water dissolves when the surface shifts, so quickly you aren't sure anything changed.

The sand drawings were there. Xu Ran was there. The fire was there. The scrolls and maps and evidence were there.

But the meaning was gone.

Not the facts. I could still see the lines. I could still count the anomaly markers. I could still read his notation. The content was present. The comprehension was absent. As if someone had taken a perfectly legible page and removed the ability to read, leaving the marks intact but stripping them of significance.

I looked at Xu Ran.

"What were you saying?" I asked.

His face changed. Not dramatically — Xu Ran's face didn't do dramatic changes. But something behind his eyes shifted, the way tectonic plates shift: invisibly, slowly, with consequences that arrive later.

"What?" he said.

"You were saying something. Something important. I can tell — your hands were moving, you were drawing." I looked at the sand. Lines. Circles. Arrows. They looked like... "What do these mean?"

He stared at me.

"You just — " He stopped. Closed his eyes. Opened them. "You JUST said 'yes.' Ten seconds ago. You said 'yes, I understand.'"

"I said yes to what?"

Silence.

The fire cracked. A spark rose. The scrolls fluttered.

"Yun." His voice was controlled. Too controlled — the control of someone gripping reins when the horse has already bolted. "I spent twenty minutes explaining the pattern. The evidence. The connections. You listened. You nodded. You said you understood. And now — ten seconds later — you don't remember what I said?"

I searched. Internally. Carefully. The way you feel along a shelf in the dark for something you know is there.

Nothing.

He had said something important. I was certain of that — the certainty was physical, a pressure in my chest, the residue of a reaction I could feel without remembering what caused it. Something had landed. Something had settled. And then something had lifted it out, clean, complete, leaving the impression but removing the object, like a footprint in sand with no foot.

"I remember you talking," I said. "I remember thinking it was important."

"But not what it was."

"No."

He picked up his drawing stick. Threw it. Not at anything — into the dark, where it hit grass and disappeared. The gesture was sharp, frustrated, the controlled violence of someone who cannot do what they want to do (which was probably scream) and substitutes something less satisfying.

He sat down. Hard. His jaw worked.

"Again," he said.

"What?"

"I'll say it again."
