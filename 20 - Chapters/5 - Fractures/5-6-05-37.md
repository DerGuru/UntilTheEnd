Xu Ran had made tea.

He'd made it, he told me later, during the blackout — during the three or four seconds when I'd stood with my eyes open and nobody behind them, when the deletion had been running and the gap had been forming and the truth had been taken with the totality of something that meant it. He'd stood for those seconds. Watched. Waited. And when it became clear that I wasn't going to fall down or break reality or erase another mountain, he'd done the only thing he could think of.

He'd made tea.

Routines. The refuge of people who can't manage the extraordinary — reach for the ordinary, perform the familiar, let the muscles and the habits and the deeply ingrained automatisms of daily life fill the space that comprehension can't.

He handed me the cup. Ceramic — the small travel cup he carried, chipped at the rim, stained dark from years of use. The tea inside was cold. He'd made it during the blackout, which meant it had been sitting for however long we'd been in the clearing — minutes, hours, I couldn't tell, the gap made time uncertain.

I held the cup. The ceramic was cool against my palms.

I drank. The tea was cold and bitter and tasted of mountain herbs — whatever blend he'd been using since we'd entered these highlands, something astringent and slightly floral that lived in the middle range between pleasant and medicinal.

"I'm cold," I said.

The words came out before I'd processed them. Automatic. The verbal reflex of a body reporting a sensation to the consciousness that inhabited it.

Xu Ran turned.

He turned slowly. The slowness of someone who has heard something impossible and needs the rotation to take long enough to arrange a response. He looked at me. The look was — I don't have a word. Not surprise, although surprise was in it. Not alarm, although alarm was in it. Something deeper. The expression of a man who was recalculating everything he knew about a person based on two words.

"You're cold," he repeated.

"Yes." I held the cup tighter. The cold of the ceramic was sharp — not painful, but present, tangibly present, in a way that cold had never been before. "The tea is cold."

"It's been sitting for twenty minutes."

"I'm cold."

He stared at me.

I had never been cold.

In all the time we'd traveled together — and before that, in all the time I'd traveled alone, through snow and rain and the altitude cold that strips heat from bodies like wind peeling bark from dead wood — I had never been cold. Qi regulated temperature. The cultivation base that I carried — whatever it was, whatever level defied classification — maintained my body in a state of constant warmth that no external condition had ever disrupted.

Snow: not cold. Rain: not cold. Mountain winds that made lesser cultivators shiver: not cold.

I had registered temperature as information, not sensation. Cold existed as awareness — a reading, a notation, a fact about the environment that my body acknowledged and corrected without requiring my awareness or producing any subjective experience.

Now I was cold. The tea was cold in my hands and the air was cold on my skin and the morning was cold in the way that mornings are cold when you feel them, really feel them, without the insulation of a body that does your feeling for you.

Something had changed.

The breakthrough — the second of seeing, the crack in the wall, the deletion that followed — had broken something. Not the wall itself — the wall was still there, still functioning, still erasing content with the precise, systematic efficiency of something that knew its job. But the wall's coverage had shifted. The wall protected thoughts. The wall erased content. The wall maintained the gap between me and whatever truth lived behind it.

The wall did not, apparently, protect sensation.

The feeling in my chest — the nameless frequency, the bass note vibration that the deletion hadn't taken — was accompanied by a new state of sensory awareness that I hadn't asked for and didn't know how to adjust to. The world was louder. Sharper. More present.

The grass beneath my feet was individually distinct — not a uniform surface but a thousand separate blades, each one pressing against the sole of my foot with its own distinct pressure. The wind touched my face and I felt it — really felt it, the way mortals feel wind, as a physical contact, a collision of moving air against exposed skin. The light was too bright. Not blindingly — specifically. As if someone had taken the sensitivity of my eyes and turned it one notch higher, past the range where brightness was information and into the range where brightness was sensation.

Everything was more.

And every *more* was uncomfortable, because I had been shaped for less, because my entire experience of physical existence had been mediated by something that turned the world into abstraction before it reached me, and now the barrier was failing.

"The tea," I said. I drank more. The bitterness was vivid — individual flavors registering on my tongue with the vivid detail of things being tasted for the first time. "It tastes—"

"Cold?"

"Everything." I looked at him. "It tastes like everything."

He didn't understand. How could he? He'd spent his entire life tasting things fully, feeling things fully, experiencing the world at full sensory volume without the insulating layer that cultivation provided. For him, tea tasted like tea. For me — for the me who had existed until five minutes ago — tea had tasted like a category. Now it tasted like one event in one moment at one temperature, and the intimacy of it was overwhelming.

I sat down. The ground was cold and hard and detailed, every stone and root and depression in the terrain registering against my body with the piercing awareness of someone stripped of every barrier.

"I was—" I started.

The thought slipped. Not dramatically — softly, like a word on the tip of the tongue sliding backward, retreating into the place where thoughts went when the wall decided they weren't allowed. The thought-echo. The residual vibration of whatever I'd been about to think, lingering in the space between intention and articulation.

"I was—"

Again. The same beginning. The same retreat. The wall doing its work, quietly, efficiently, in the background of my awareness, cleaning up the loose thoughts that the breakthrough had scattered.

"I—"

Three echoes. Quieter than before. Aftershocks, fading.

I stopped trying to think. I held the cup. I felt the cold.

The cold was real. The cold was mine. The cold had gotten through the wall's coverage because the wall protected thoughts and cold was not a thought. Cold was a sensation, and sensations were a different category, and the breakthrough had — deliberately or accidentally, by design or by damage — opened the channel between me and the physical world.

"Give me your outer robe," I said.

Xu Ran blinked. Then removed his outer layer — the worn, practical, grey garment that served as both insulation and identity — and handed it to me without question.

I put it on. It was warm. Not warm the way qi-regulation was warm — distant, maintained from within, a state rather than a sensation. Warm the way fabric is warm when it's been against a body. Human warm. Real warm. The kind of warm that comes from outside and has to be received rather than generated.

It smelled like him. Travel dirt and ink and the scent of a person who walked too far and slept too little and documented everything.

I wore your outer robe for three days. You didn't ask for it back. We never discussed why.

I pulled the outer robe tighter.

The feeling in my chest pulsed. The nameless frequency. The thing that survived. It pulsed with the steady rhythm of something alive, something present, something that existed below the wall's jurisdiction and above the body's silent rhythms.

"Something changed," I said.

"Yes."

"I don't know what."

"I know."

I looked at him. He looked guilty. Not the obvious guilt of a person caught doing something wrong — the deeper guilt, the structural guilt of a person who had done something right for wrong reasons, or something wrong for right reasons, or something that was both and neither and would take years to categorize.

He'd hurt me on purpose. I didn't know this yet — the content of what he'd done was gone, erased, taken. But the guilt on his face was evidence of something, and the feeling in my chest was evidence of something, and the cold on my skin was evidence of something.

Evidence that I was closer to whatever truth the wall was hiding than I had ever been before.

I finished the tea. Set down the cup. The ceramic was cold.

"Can we go back to camp?" I asked. The question was simple and real and contained no subtext. I was cold. I wanted warmth. The fire at camp was warmth. The logic was mortal, basic, stripped of cultivation's elaborate relationship with comfort and reduced to the fundamental: I am cold, fire is warm, take me to the fire.

"Yes," Xu Ran said. He picked up his things. Picked up mine.

We walked back. I shuffled, the outer robe too large, the morning too bright, the grass too sharp, the world too detailed, everything too much and not enough and present in a way that presence had never been before.

Something had changed. Something fundamental. Something irreversible.

And the feeling in my chest — nameless, formless, ancient as stone — hummed quietly, like a frequency finally tuned to its proper station.
