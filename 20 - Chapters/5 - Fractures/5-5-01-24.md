The morning after the forgetting was quiet in the way that mornings after disasters are quiet — not peaceful, just emptied.

I woke irritated. The irritation had no name, no target, no cause I could identify. It sat in my chest like a fist, clenched around something I couldn't see. Residue. The dregs of whatever had happened to me last night, whatever Xu Ran had tried three times to explain, whatever my own mind had erased with the surgical precision of something that knew exactly what it was doing.

The gap was still there. Pulsing. A hole in the shape of a truth I couldn't remember.

I stood. Stretched. The morning air was cool and smelled of pine resin and dew and the clean stillness that comes before the world fills up with heat and noise and the business of existing.

Ten meters away, a branch snapped.

Not fell — snapped. The sound was sharp, loud, the crack of wood being broken by force. But there was no force. No wind. No animal. Just a branch on a pine tree that had been intact a moment ago and was now hanging at an angle, the fresh wood inside pale and wet, the break as clean as if someone had gripped it and pulled.

Xu Ran looked at the branch. Looked at me. His hand moved to his notebook.

I hadn't noticed the branch. Or — I had heard it. Had registered the sound. Had filed it away under *things that happen in forests* and moved on to the next thought.

Except forests don't snap branches in still air. And the timing — the moment I'd clenched my jaw against the nameless irritation — was a coincidence I didn't believe in.

Something in the undergrowth stirred. A small creature — fox-like, but not, the kind of minor spirit beast that occupies the space between wildlife and cultivation, too simple for intelligence but sensitive enough to read qi the way a dog reads scent. It had been sleeping in the brush. Now it was awake, head tilted, ears forward, staring at me with the focused attention of something that heard a sound it couldn't identify.

Not the branch. Something else. Something beneath the audible range, beneath the physical range, in the qi-spectrum where only spirit beasts and very old cultivators could listen.

It heard me. Whatever I was leaking — whatever emotion was translating into force and breaking branches and catching the attention of creatures that shouldn't have noticed me — it heard that.

Xu Ran wrote. I packed.

We walked.

The day should have been unremarkable. The trail was well-maintained, cutting through mixed forest toward a river crossing we'd been aiming for since the mountain pass. Weather was clear. Terrain was manageable. The normal business of putting one foot in front of another and letting the distance accumulate like a debt being paid in installments.

But the world was listening.

I felt it — had been feeling it since the shrine, since the first wrong wind, since the first anomaly. But now it was different. Now the world wasn't just adjusting retroactively, quietly, behind my back. Now it was responding in real time. To me. To what I felt.

The sect scouts appeared around mid-morning.

Two of them, on the ridge above the trail, positioned with the calculated casualness of people who want you to know they're there. Grey robes. Talismans at their belts. Not approaching. Just watching. The same patient observation that the Pencil's delegation had promised and the Pencil's organization had clearly delivered on.

My hands clenched.

Three trees — pine, old, sixty years of patient growth at least — split along their trunks. Not at the base. Not at a weak point. Along the vertical center, as if invisible hands had gripped each side and pulled. The wood screamed — a sound that trees make when they come apart that is nothing like the sound of cutting and everything like the sound of tearing, of separation, of something unified being forced into halves.

The scouts disappeared. Not killed, not targeted, not consciously dismissed. They simply chose to be elsewhere, very quickly, with the refined survival instinct of people who have been trained to recognize when a situation has moved beyond their authority to handle.

"Yun," Xu Ran said. Quiet. The quiet of someone standing next to a loaded weapon.

I looked at the trees. Three of them. Split. The fresh wood inside was pale and wet and glistening, the way exposed wounds glisten. Sap ran down the torn surfaces like something bleeding.

"That was not —" I started.

It was. I knew it was. The lie died before it formed.

I unclenched my hands. The forest settled. The sound of tearing stopped. Birds, which had gone silent, began again — tentatively, the way birds begin after a predator has passed.

"Anger," Xu Ran said. Not a question.

"The scouts."

"I saw them. They're gone now." He looked at the trees. "Along with about a hundred and eighty years of combined growth."

I said nothing. We walked.

The rain started an hour later.

Not weather-rain. Not the rain that comes from clouds and follows pressure systems and obeys the atmospheric rules that normal rain obeys. This rain came from a clear sky. This rain fell in a circle — I paced it later — of exactly twelve meters in diameter, centered on me. Beyond the circle, dry ground. Inside the circle, a downpour heavy enough to flatten the grass and soak through Xu Ran's clothes in seconds.

He was standing beside me when it started. He didn't move.

I hadn't been thinking about Wei. Not consciously. The thought had arrived — the way Wei-thoughts always arrived now, uninvited, unannounced, triggered by something I couldn't identify — and had been pushed away, suppressed, filed under *not now,* and the grief had gone somewhere, had found an outlet, and the outlet was the sky.

Twelve meters of private rain.

Xu Ran stood in it. Water ran down his face, plastered his hair to his skull, darkened his robes from grey to black. He made no move to step out of the circle. He made no move to raise qi-protection.

He just stood there. Getting wet. Getting wetter. Not saying a word.

That was his answer. To whatever I was — to whatever I was doing to the world, to the trees, to the weather, to the ground beneath our feet — his answer was to stand in it.

The rain lasted seven minutes. Grief is not a long emotion, not the acute kind. It burns hot and brief and leaves behind something slower, something cooler, something that settles rather than erupts.

When it stopped, the sun was still shining. The ground inside the circle was dark and wet. The ground outside was dry.

"That was—"

"You," he said.

I nodded.

We walked. He dripped. I did too, but I dried faster — qi doing its involuntary work, evaporating the moisture from my skin and clothes with the unasked-for diligence of a force that maintained its vessel whether the vessel wanted maintenance or not.

The frustration hit that afternoon.

I'd tried to read the scroll copies again. Not the originals — Xu Ran's transcriptions, his careful hand reproducing ancient texts in modern characters. I'd unrolled them, and my eyes had tracked the lines, and the characters had been there, legible, clear.

And my mind had refused.

Not the slow, gentle erasure of the night before. A wall. Solid. Instant. As if I tried to read a language I'd never learned — except I HAD read these. Had understood them. Had discussed them with Xu Ran. Had drawn conclusions from them.

None of that remained.

The ground trembled. Not hard — the kind of tremor you feel in your feet before you hear it, the low bass vibration of stone adjusting under stress. Dust rose from the trail in thin curtains. A rock the size of a man's head rolled three meters downhill without being touched.

I set the scrolls down.

The trembling stopped.

Branch. Trees. Rain. Tremor.

Each one bigger. Each one less controllable. Each one more directly tied to whatever was happening inside me — the emotions I couldn't manage, the grief I couldn't process, the frustration I couldn't resolve, the gap that kept pulsing behind my eyes where understanding used to live and now lived only absence.

I was a string wound too tight. And the world was the instrument.

"We need to keep moving," I said.

Xu Ran didn't argue. He was dripping, quiet, writing in a notebook that had been protected from the rain by the simple expedient of being inside a waterproof case that he'd apparently started carrying since the first time I'd made weather happen.

Adaptive. He was always adaptive.

We moved.
