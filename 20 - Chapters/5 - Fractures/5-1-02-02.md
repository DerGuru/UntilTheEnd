I found the technique on the third day.

Not through meditation or qi-sensing or any of the methods a proper cultivator would use. I found it the way you find a coin in dirt — by scraping long enough with nothing but stubbornness and fingernails.

The panel was on the inner wall, east-facing, partially hidden behind a column that had shifted over the centuries. The column had cracked at the base and leaned three degrees from vertical — I could see where it had scored a line in the floor tile during its slow, centuries-long topple. Behind it, protected from weather and time by that unintentional shield, the carving was crisp.

A figure. Standing. Arms raised in a position I knew.

Not because I'd studied it. Not because I'd seen someone else do it. I knew it the way you know the path from your bed to the door in the dark — body memory, bone memory, the kind of knowledge that lives below thought.

My hands went to it before I'd decided to touch it. Fingers tracing grooves. Here — the left hand higher, angled inward. There — the right foot turned, weight shifted to the outer edge. The qi indicators ran along the figure's spine like a river drawn in stone, bifurcating at the shoulders, pooling at the palms.

I knew where the pools were before my fingers reached them.

I stood back. Looked at it.

The figure was me.

Not literally. The proportions were wrong, the face was a stylized mask — shrines of this era didn't do portraiture. But the stance. The flow. The exact arrangement of body and energy that turns a person into a conduit rather than a container.

I knew this technique. I could do it right now, standing here in this half-collapsed ruin with chalk grit between my teeth and cold stone under my boots. I could raise my arms and the qi would respond, not because I'd learned how but because the knowledge was already there, had always been there, buried under millennia of forgetting like a foundation under soil.

"You're staring," Xu Ran said.

He'd come in quietly. He did that — moved through spaces as though apologizing to the air for displacing it. His notebook was in his hand, already open.

"I'm reading."

"You've been reading for twenty minutes. The same panel."

"It's a long panel."

He came closer. Studied the carving over my shoulder. I could feel his breath — warm, slightly faster than resting pace. He was interested. Xu Ran's interest had a physical quality to it: his weight shifted forward, his pen hovered, his eyes narrowed by exactly the degree that meant he was thinking faster than he was willing to show.

"A cultivation technique," he said.

"Yes."

"Old."

"Pre-Consolidated."

"Can you read it?"

I didn't answer immediately. The honest answer was complicated. I could read it the way you can read a language you haven't spoken in decades — the shapes were familiar, the meaning arrived late, trailing the recognition like a shadow trailing a body.

"Some of it," I said.

He wrote something. I didn't ask what. His notebook had become a kind of companion in its own right — a silent third presence that absorbed everything he didn't say out loud.

I went outside. The morning air was sharp with pine resin and the fading coolness of a night that hadn't been cold enough. Another wrong thing — this altitude, this season, the nights should bite. They didn't.

I raised my arms.

Not all the way. Not the full position from the carving. Just enough to test the first form — the initial stance, the opening of channels, the invitation to the qi to move along paths it hadn't been asked to travel.

It responded immediately. Not like learning. Like remembering.

The qi flowed from my dantian through meridians I'd never consciously opened, through pathways that existed in my body like riverbeds that had been dry for so long everyone had forgotten they were riverbeds. Water found them effortlessly. The channels filled. The energy moved.

I held the position for ten breaths. Each breath easier than the last. Each one revealing a new branch, a new tributary, a map of pathways that my body knew and my mind didn't.

I dropped my arms.

My hands were shaking. Not from effort.

I went back inside.

Xu Ran was still at the panel, sketching the carving into his notebook. His reproduction was precise — he had the eye of an archivist, catching proportions and spatial relationships that most people would blur into approximation. He'd labeled the qi indicators with his own notation, a shorthand I'd seen him develop over the months.

"Since when can you read Pre-Consolidated script?" he asked without looking up.

I let the question hang. The chalk dust was back between my teeth. The incense smell curled through the ruin like a living thing — faint, sweet, sourceless.

"Since when do I read anything in front of you?"

"You didn't just read it. You traced it. Your fingers followed the flow lines before they got to them. I watched." Now he looked up. "You knew what came next."

Silence.

In the courtyard, the wind shifted. Not dramatically — a degree, maybe two. Enough that the smoke from last night's dead fire stirred and changed direction. I noted it. Wrong wind. Again.

"Write it down," I said.

He blinked. "Write what down?"

"Technique recognized. Never learned. Date." I paused. "Location. Conditions. Whatever you think matters."

He studied me for a long moment. Then he wrote. His pen moved in clean, measured strokes, and I could see the entry forming even from this distance — because Xu Ran's handwriting, unlike his personality, was completely transparent.

*She knew it before she read it,* the script said. Or something close to it. I didn't lean in far enough to read the rest.

I went back to the wall. There were more panels. More carvings. More things I might know without having learned them. The thought should have been exciting — a mystery, a trail to follow, a reason to move forward that wasn't just momentum.

It wasn't exciting. It was cold. The same cold as the metal fittings, the same cold as the stone beneath my palms. The cold of something that had been waiting, patiently, for someone to come and recognize it.

For me to come.

By afternoon I'd catalogued three more panels. Two were too damaged to read — time had done its patient work, grinding symbols to smooth stone, erasing meaning one grain at a time. The third showed a formation I didn't recognize, and the relief of not-knowing was so sharp it startled me.

I stood in front of that unknown panel for a long time, just to feel what it was like to look at something and have no idea what it meant.

Normal. It felt normal.

Everything else felt like a homecoming I hadn't asked for.
