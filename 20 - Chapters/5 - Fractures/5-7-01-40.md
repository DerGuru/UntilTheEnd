Morning arrived in fragments.

Not the usual way. Not the unified experience of transitioning from sleep to consciousness, from dark to light, from horizontal to vertical. It arrived in pieces. First the cold. Always the cold now, the baseline sensation that I woke to and went to sleep with and carried through every hour between. Then the sound. Bird calls that used to register as background and now registered as individual voices, each one carrying pitch and rhythm and the tonality of a creature with opinions about the morning.

Then the light. Too bright. The pre-dawn grey that used to be mere backdrop was now sensation, and sensation was sharp, and sharp was exhausting, and exhausting was the new condition.

I opened my eyes. The world was there. Sharper. Louder. More detailed than any world had a right to be at this hour.

The crack was there too.

I'd started thinking of it that way — the crack. The thing the breakthrough had left behind, the fissure in the wall that the guardian had tried to seal and hadn't managed to seal completely. Not an opening. I couldn't see through it, couldn't access whatever truth lay on the other side. But a weakness. A point of vulnerability in the structure that had been, until recently, airtight.

Like a loose tooth. I'd had a loose tooth as a child, one of the early ones, the kind that loosened gradually and then sat in the gum for days, moving slightly with every touch of the tongue, not painful but insistent, demanding attention through the simple fact of its wrongness. The crack was like that. A thing I could press against — mentally, with the interior equivalent of a tongue — and feel move. Feel give. Feel the resistance of something that was still attached but wouldn't be, eventually.

I pressed against it. Gently. The way you press a loose tooth. Not to remove it, just to feel it, just to confirm it's still loose, just to verify that the change is real and continuing.

The crack responded. Not with information. Not with images or words or the blinding flood of the breakthrough second. With a draft. The interior equivalent of air through a gap, the faintest difference in pressure, the subtlest indication that there was another side and that the other side had its own atmosphere.

Something on the other side was breathing.

I sat up. Xu Ran's outer robe fell from my shoulders. I'd been sleeping in it, had been sleeping in it every night since the cold had started, and the gesture had become unremarked upon, the way habits become unremarked upon when they establish themselves quickly enough.

Movement at the edge of vision.

The fox-spirit. The small creature from before, or one like it, the distinctions among minor spirit beasts being uncertain enough that individual identification was guesswork. It was lying in the grass three meters from my bedroll. Not sleeping. Watching. Its eyes were amber and ancient as animal eyes are ancient, carrying the accumulated wisdom of species rather than individuals.

It had come closer than before.

Spirit beasts read qi the way mortals read faces: instinctively, automatically, sensing state and intent and danger through instincts that ran beneath conscious thought. This one had been reading me from a distance since the first days in the mountains, keeping the cautious perimeter that wild things keep around unpredictable things.

Now it was three meters away. Lying in the grass beside my bedroll as if it belonged there.

Something had changed. In my qi signature, in whatever frequency I broadcast to things that could listen on that spectrum, something had shifted. The breakthrough — the crack, the opening, the feeling — had altered whatever I projected, and the alteration was apparently legible to creatures that operated on instinct rather than analysis.

The fox-spirit regarded me with the patient attention of something that had been waiting for this and recognized the change.

I didn't move toward it. Didn't reach out. Just acknowledged it. As you would anything that shares your space without invitation, with the quiet acceptance of coexistence.

It closed its eyes. Settled deeper into the grass. Stayed.

Xu Ran was already up. He moved around camp with the practiced economy of a man performing the morning routine, but differently. Softer. His gestures had a care to them that hadn't been there before the clearing. Some kind of deliberateness, as if he were handling fragile things near a fragile person and wanted to make sure every motion communicated gentleness.

He'd paid his price. The question — the terrible, necessary, devastating question that I couldn't remember — had cost him something fundamental. Not guilt, although guilt was part of it. Innocence, maybe. The innocence of a man who had never deliberately hurt someone and could now no longer claim that.

He handed me tea. Warm, this time. He'd learned to bring it before the cold settled too deep.

"How are you?" he asked. The question was genuine. Not conversational filling, not the automatic inquiry of habit. He wanted to know. He needed to know, the way a surgeon needs to know whether the patient survived the surgery.

"I feel the crack," I said.

He nodded. Set down his own cup. Reached for the notebook — hesitated. Didn't open it. The hesitation was new. Before the clearing, the notebook would have been open already, the pen moving, the observation transmuting into record with the automatic efficiency of a habit built on documentation.

Now he hesitated. As if recording me had become something that required consent rather than assumption.

"Like a loose tooth," I continued. "I can push against it. It gives. But I can't see through."

"Does it hurt?"

I considered. "Not yet. But it will."

He took a breath. Let it out. The exhale carried something. The residue of something he wanted to say and was choosing not to, the disciplined silence of a man who had learned that sometimes the kindest thing he could do was not provide information.

We packed. The fox-spirit watched, amber eyes tracking our movements with the close interest of something that had decided we were worth watching. When we lifted our packs and turned toward the trail, it stood. Stretched — the long, full-body stretch of a creature waking fully. And followed.

Three meters behind. The distance of curiosity without commitment.

We walked. East — still east, always east, the world's insistence on directing me toward isolation continuing with the quiet authority of a current beneath the surface. But the walking felt different now. Not the mechanical forward motion of previous days, not the determined, head-down, one-foot-then-the-other progression of someone moving because stopping was worse.

This was walking with something in my chest. Walking with a crack in the wall and a draft through the gap and a feeling that pulsed with every heartbeat and a world that was louder and brighter and colder than any world had been before.

Walking with a fox at my heels and guilt at my companion's shoulders and the distant awareness that three sect cultivators were watching from the tree line with the patient attention of people who had upgraded their classification of me from threat to phenomenon.

Walking forward. Because forward was the only direction the crack opened toward.
