The third ruin confirmed it.

An observatory, or what was left of one. Built on a ridge so high the air thinned and Xu Ran's breathing became audible. Stone walls arranged in concentric circles, openings aligned with star positions that no longer matched the current sky. The astronomers who'd designed it had been meticulous. The stars had moved. Or the sky had.

I tasted chalk the moment we stepped inside. The metal braces holding the observation slits (sophisticated engineering for its era, adjustable angles, counterweights) were cold enough to sting. The incense was there too, faint as memory.

Three markers. Every time.

The qi underneath the observatory matched. Foundation layer. Old. My signature, or its cousin. Pressed into volcanic rock that had cooled ten thousand years before anyone had thought to build anything here.

And in the lower chamber, where the astronomers had stored their charts and calculations, I found the inscriptions. Different hand, different script, different century. Same content. Anomalies. Deviations. Things that didn't match.

Same ending. Mid-character. Mid-thought. Gone.

Three researchers across three sites spanning roughly two thousand years. Each one independently had noticed what I was noticing. Each one had documented what I was documenting. Each one had pushed toward one unseen center, the truth that something was wrong with reality, that the wrongness had a pattern, and that the pattern pointed inward, toward a source.

Each one had been erased before they got there.

"Pattern," Xu Ran said that evening. We were camped below the ridge, where the air was thick enough to cook in. The fire crackled with pine resin, spitting sparks into the dark. His notebook was open across his knees, filled with the day's observations.

"Not just a pattern. A design." The word sat uneasy in my mouth. Too deliberate, too clean. This wasn't deliberate at all. It was organic. A living thing that responded to pressure, that defended itself, that closed wounds before they could open wide enough to bleed.

"A design that does what?"

"Erases people who ask the right questions."

He looked at me over the notebook. The firelight caught his face at an angle that made him look older than he was, or younger, depending on which shadow you followed. "And you're asking the right questions."

"Apparently."

"Then why are you still here?"

A fair question. I'd been asking it myself, in the quiet hours between sleep and wakefulness, in the spaces between anomalies. Why hadn't it happened to me? Why was I still standing, still searching, still capable of recognizing what those researchers had recognized before their recognition was taken from them?

There were several possible answers. None of them were comforting.

"I don't know," I said. Which was true. And incomplete.

I did know — or rather, I suspected — that the answer had something to do with the fact that the qi under those ruins was mine. That whatever had stopped those researchers was whatever had laid the foundation they were studying. That the eraser and the evidence were the same hand.

My hand.

The headache hit. Sharp. Centered. A needle through the space behind my left eye, driven with precision and withdrawn just as quickly. I pressed my thumb against my temple and held it there until the afterimage faded.

*Not yet.*

There it was again. The gate. The reflex. The part of my mind that slammed shut with the speed of something practiced — not a new response, but an old one. Ancient. Built into the architecture of my thinking like load-bearing walls you can't remove without bringing down the ceiling.

I released my temple. Opened my eyes. Xu Ran was watching me.

"The headaches are getting worse," he said.

"They're manageable."

"That's not what I asked."

"It's what I answered."

He held my gaze for a moment. Then he looked down at his notebook and wrote something I couldn't see.

Over the next nine days, we found four more sites. A temple complex in a river valley, flooded, half-submerged, the qi so concentrated in the waterlogged stone that the river itself flowed warmer near the foundations. A hermit's cave in the western foothills, barely large enough for one person, with inscriptions scratched into the walls with a fingernail. An abandoned sect compound, overtaken by forest, the trees growing in patterns that followed the qi lines below the soil. A roadside shrine, small and unremarkable, that nonetheless had that foundation layer, that impossible depth, that quiet signature.

Every site: chalk dust. Cold metal. Incense.

Every site: inscriptions by a different researcher.

Every site: that ending.

Seven sites across three thousand years. Seven researchers. Each drawn to a single center. Each erased.

And underneath them all — me. Or something that wore my qi like a signature.

The list had grown. Fourteen anomalies in three weeks. The path that curved. The valley that became a plateau. The wind from the wrong direction. An owl outside its range. A river wider than it should be. A temperature off for the altitude. Stars in slightly different positions. A tree I remembered as an oak and found as a pine, in the exact spot, with the exact lean.

Small things. Individual, any one of them could be dismissed. Memory error. Climate shift. Natural variation. But together — together they formed something larger. A mosaic that didn't show its picture until you stepped back far enough.

The picture was this: reality was being edited. Subtly. Retroactively. Not in large strokes, no cities vanishing, no mountains relocating. In the smallest possible increments. A path bending two degrees. A species range shifting a hundred li. An age gap in qi signatures that shouldn't exist.

Whoever was editing was patient. Was precise. Was thorough. And was, based on the qi evidence, either me or something that had once been me or something that I would eventually become.

I hadn't slept well since the library. The headaches came and went, always at those moments, always when my thinking approached those edges. I'd learned their rhythm the way you learn any pain: by noting what provoked it, what eased it, and what it defended.

It defended the center. The question that all seven researchers had been approaching. The connection that, drawn in full, would reveal something I apparently couldn't be allowed to see.

The fourteenth anomaly was the worst.

We were walking through a bamboo grove, tall, mature growth, the kind that takes decades to establish. The path was well-maintained, a local trail, marked by stone cairns at regular intervals. Normal grove. Normal path.

I had walked this grove forty years ago. It had been a clearing then. Open ground, grass, a single dead tree in the center that birds used as a perching station. I'd rested there during a long walk south. I'd sat with my back against the dead tree and counted hawks.

The tree was gone. The clearing was gone. The bamboo grew in its place, thick and old and undeniably real. Roots deep. Canopy established. The kind of growth that says *I have been here longer than your memory, and I will be here after your doubt.*

But I had sat against that tree and counted hawks, and no amount of bamboo could unmake that.

I stopped in the center of the grove. The bamboo whispered. Wind through hollow stems — a sound like breathing, or like someone trying to shush you.

"Yun?" Xu Ran said.

"This was a clearing."

He looked around. Tall bamboo in every direction, as far as the filtered light reached. "When?"

"Forty years ago."

"Bamboo can grow — "

"Not this much. Not this established. This grove is at least eighty years old." I touched a stalk. Thick. Solid. "This bamboo was growing here when I sat in this clearing. And it wasn't."

He was quiet. The bamboo whispered.

"Both can't be true," he said finally.

"No," I said. "They can't."

I didn't add: *unless someone changed it. Unless someone reached back and planted this grove before I sat here, so that by the time I arrived, it had always been growing. Unless the edit was retroactive. Unless the clearing I remember is the truth, and this bamboo is the correction.*

I didn't add it because the headache was already building, and because some thoughts are too heavy to carry in the open where someone else might try to help you hold them.

That night, I couldn't sleep.

Xu Ran's breathing was steady in the dark. I sat at the low table in the roadside inn where we'd stopped and spread his notebook open in front of me. His handwriting was precise, almost beautiful, the script of someone who valued documentation the way other people valued comfort. Every anomaly was logged. Every observation dated and located.

The fourteenth entry was the last. Below it, in Xu Ran's shorthand, a summary: spatial inconsistencies, qi foundation anomalies, signature match (her), terrain deviation, temporal impossibilities.

I read it twice.

Then I tore the page out.

Neatly. Along the binding. The sound was very small — a whisper, a sigh, the kind of noise that means something only if you know how to listen. I folded the page twice. Put it in the inner pocket of my robe, against my skin, where it would ride flat and invisible.

The notebook closed cleanly. The tear was barely visible; you'd have to know the page was missing to look for its absence.

Xu Ran couldn't have this. Not the summary. Not the connections I could see forming in his tidy handwriting, drawing lines between dots that pointed, inevitably, at me. He was building the picture those seven researchers had built. Their mosaic. Their center.

I knew how those stories ended.

I sat in the dark and listened to him breathe and told myself I was protecting him from the information. That the knowledge was dangerous. That knowing what the pattern pointed at would put him at risk: from whatever had stopped those researchers, from forces I didn't understand, from consequences I couldn't predict.

That was the reason I told myself. The clean reason. The rational one.

The real reason was simpler and worse.

My hands wouldn't stop moving — folding the hem of my sleeve, pressing the callus on my thumb, the restless choreography of a body preparing for something the mind refused to name. He would look at the evidence — his evidence, gathered in his handwriting, laid out with his precision — and he would see what it meant. And he would either run, which I couldn't allow, or try to help, which I couldn't survive.

The folded page pressed against my skin.

Xu Ran breathed.

I sat in the dark.
