The world was coming apart, and no one knew it was my fault.

We heard the first reports in a trading town three days south of the library — a narrow place built along a river crossing, the kind of settlement that exists because geography put it at the intersection of two roads and commerce filled the gap. Merchants, travelers, a few lower-ranked cultivators passing through. The usual traffic.

Except the usual traffic was frightened.

A tea seller told us about a village to the east where the qi had reversed direction overnight. Foundation-level cultivators — people who'd been quietly building their cores for decades — woke up with their meridians running backward. Some lost everything. Some gained power they couldn't control. Three of them were dead.

A traveling merchant described lights in the sky above the northern mountains. Qi currents that were normally invisible had become visible — threads of energy writhing across the clouds like veins laid bare beneath split skin. They lasted hours. He'd watched from a hilltop and said it looked like the sky was bleeding.

A sect courier, passing through with dispatches, mentioned that two regional sects had sealed their gates. No entry, no exit. They were calling it a spiritual climate event — the bureaucratic language of people who have no idea what's happening and need a phrase that sounds like they do.

Xu Ran sat at the tea house table and listened to all of it with the composed attention of someone cataloguing evidence.

"The whole region," he said, after the courier had left. "Not just here. Not just around the ruins."

"No."

"How far?"

I'd been feeling it for days. The qi disturbances weren't local anymore — they rippled outward from... from the places I'd been. Not immediately. Not obviously. But the timing matched, the geography correlated, and the pattern was unmistakable once you knew what to look for.

Which I did.

"Far," I said.

He looked at me across the teacups. There was a question in his eyes that he didn't ask, because he already knew the answer, and asking would have forced me to say it, and saying it in a public tea house surrounded by frightened merchants was a particularly poor idea even by our standards.

He drank his tea instead. I drank mine. The tea seller came by twice to see if we wanted more, and twice I waved him away, because whatever was happening in the world outside this window was not going to be improved by additional tea.

The sky that evening was wrong. Not the stars — those were correct, I checked — but the light. The sunset lasted too long, the colors shifted through a spectrum that didn't match the season, and for about twenty minutes, the entire western horizon looked like a bruise: purple shading to green, with a thin line of gold along the bottom that had no business being there.

Xu Ran stood at the window of our room and watched it.

"Beautiful," he said.

"Dangerous."

"Can't it be both?"

I didn't answer.

The next morning brought more reports. A road that had been straight for a century now curved around a hill that travelers swore hadn't been there last week. A waterfall running upward. A forest grove that had doubled in size overnight, the new trees looking as old and established as the originals.

My anomalies. My signature. Radiating outward like waves from a stone dropped in water, except the stone was me and the water was reality and the waves were getting bigger with every site I visited, every question I asked, every step closer I took to understanding what I was.

I was making it worse.

I watched the road ahead. Dust. Hills. The world going on regardless.

The realization arrived without drama. No epiphany, no thunderclap, no moment of devastating clarity. Just the quiet click of a piece falling into place — the same cold click I'd been hearing since the first shrine, since the first wrong path, since the first stone that hummed when I touched it.

I was the source. My investigation was amplifying the disturbances. Every time I probed, every time I pushed, every time I reached for the truth, reality buckled a little more. The world was adjusting to accommodate my quest, and the adjustments were cascading, and the cascades were reaching further, and people were dying.

People were dying because I was looking for answers.

I said nothing to Xu Ran. He knew anyway — I could see it in the way he studied maps now, tracing our path with his finger, noting the correlation between our route and the epicenters of reported anomalies. He hadn't said it. He was waiting for me to say it.

I wasn't ready to say it.

Three days later, we heard about the Quiet One.
