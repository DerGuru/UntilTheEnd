The scroll was better preserved than the others. Someone had taken care with it — sealed it in a stone cylinder with a wax cap that had held through centuries, stored it in a recess in the wall behind what had once been a shelf, positioned above the waterline that had destroyed its neighbors. Intentional preservation. Someone had wanted this to survive.

I broke the wax with my thumb. The cylinder opened with a dry click. The scroll inside was stiff but intact — the paper yellowed, the ink faded to a brown that was almost gone but not quite. Stubborn ink. The kind that fights.

I held it to the light beam.

The script was old. Three thousand years, give or take — the character forms placed it firmly in the pre-Consolidation era, before the standardization that had made cultivation scholarship accessible and, in the same stroke, boring. This was raw. Unedited. Someone's actual thoughts, set down in their actual hand, with all the texture and imperfection that implies.

*My qi obeyed my will, not my technique.*

I read it twice. Three times. The words didn't change.

*I shaped the flow before I understood the form. My hands moved to positions I had never studied. My body knew sequences my mind had never learned. The qi responded to intention — raw, unmediated, unfiltered — as if technique were merely a language I no longer needed, because the thing had learned to understand me directly.*

Three thousand years. A different cultivator. A different name, a different face, a different life. And an experience I recognized. A familiarity that lived below thought, below memory, in the architecture of bone and breath.

I set the scroll down. My hands were steady. My pulse was not.

In the other room, Xu Ran was sorting rubble. I could hear him — careful movements, systematic, the sound of someone who had learned that organization is a form of respect. He hummed. He did that when he was focused — a tuneless, absent sound that he wasn't aware he was making. It was almost pleasant.

I picked up the scroll again.

The rest was fragmented. Observations about qi behavior — how it deviated from known patterns, how it seemed to anticipate rather than respond, how the cultivator had begun to notice anomalies in their surroundings. Terrain shifts. Spatial inconsistencies. The language was different but the phenomena were identical to what I'd documented over the past three weeks.

Every word was a mirror.

I read until the light shifted and the beam moved off my hands. Then I carried the scroll to the entrance where the daylight was stronger and read more.

Xu Ran appeared with rice. He'd gone outside, built a fire I hadn't noticed, cooked a meal I hadn't smelled. The bowl appeared beside me. I didn't look at it. He didn't say anything. He went back inside.

After a minute, I reached for the bowl.

The rice was good. Salted correctly. He'd found wild garlic somewhere — the taste was sharp and green and grounding in a way I hadn't expected. I ate mechanically, one hand holding the bowl, the other holding the scroll, my eyes on the ancient ink while my jaw worked through something that was, against all odds, competently prepared.

I set the empty bowl down. Picked up the scroll's second section.

More. Worse. The cultivator had documented not just anomalies but consequences — places where the warping had caused structural failures, where buildings had cracked along lines that followed the qi deviations, where landscapes had shifted enough to redirect rivers. Small changes, individually. Catastrophic in aggregate.

And then: a passage that stopped my breathing.

*I attempted to end my cultivation. My body refused. I sat in meditation for forty days, willing my core to dissipate, and on the forty-first day I woke as if from sleep, with my core not only intact but stronger. As if whatever sustains me does not care about my choices. As if it has its own will, and that will is my continuance.*

My qi. My will. Not my technique.

He had tried to stop. Had tried to die, or the cultivator's equivalent — core dissolution, the unmaking of everything that separated a cultivator from a mortal. The body had refused. Something stronger than his decision had overruled him, had kept him going with the impersonal persistence of a river that doesn't know it's carving stone.

I knew exactly what that felt like.

I set the scroll on the ground and stared at my hands. They were dirty — chalk dust in the creases, stone grit under the nails, the general state of someone who's been digging through ruins. Old hands, if you knew what to look for. Not wrinkled — cultivators past a certain stage don't wrinkle — but worn in a way that has nothing to do with skin and everything to do with the weight that lives behind the eyes and sometimes, in unguarded moments, leaks through to the fingertips.

"Found something?" Xu Ran said from the doorway.

"Several somethings."

He came in. Sat across from me. Cross-legged, notebook ready, the posture of someone who was prepared to document whatever came next with the patient attention of an archivist at a dig site.

"Three thousand years old," I said. "A cultivator who experienced what I experience. His qi obeyed his will, not his technique. He tried to die. His body refused."

Xu Ran's pen stopped moving.

"And?" he said.

"And he's dead."

The pen resumed. Slower.

"So he eventually succeeded?"

"No." I picked up the scroll. Turned it over. The reverse was blank — the cultivator's account ended the way all the others had ended. Not with death or resolution or triumph, but with absence. Words that simply stopped. "He didn't die by choice. He died because — I don't know. The scroll ends."

"Same as the inscriptions."

"All of them."

He wrote. I watched his hand form characters that would, months from now, be the evidence trail of everything we'd found together. The documentation of the pattern. The map to the center.

"How many is that?" he asked. "Total. Including the inscriptions at the ruins."

"Four. Different periods. Different cultivators. Identical phenomenon. Identical ending."

"Same qi signature underneath?"

I looked at him. He looked back. Steady. That was the thing about Xu Ran — his steadiness in the face of impossible information. He didn't flinch at implications. He catalogued them. Filed them. Let them rest in orderly rows inside his notebook and inside his head, trusting that pattern would emerge from quantity.

"I haven't checked yet," I said. Which was a lie. I had checked. The answer was identical. The foundation layer here matched every other site — old, deep, my signature. But saying it out loud felt different from knowing it privately. Saying it made it a fact instead of a suspicion, and facts have consequences that suspicions don't.

He let the lie sit. He was getting better at that — recognizing when I deflected and choosing not to push. Not out of respect, I suspected, but out of strategy. Xu Ran was learning that the truth I held back was sometimes more informative than the truth I offered.

"Eat more," he said, and pushed the pot toward me.

I didn't eat more. But I picked up the next scroll.
