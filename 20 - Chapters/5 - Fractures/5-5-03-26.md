Xu Ran was afraid of me.

Not the cautious, intellectual kind. The deeper thing — the thing that lived beneath reason.

I saw it in the way he handed me the rice bowl at dinner. The pause — fractional, almost invisible. He caught himself. Completed the gesture. The bowl changed hands.

But the pause had been there.

"You're afraid," I said.

He ate. Chewed. Swallowed. The deliberateness of someone composing a response.

"Yes."

"Since when?"

"Since the trees." He set his bowl down. "The rain — that was grief. I could stand in that. Standing in someone's grief is not comfortable, but it is comprehensible. Grief is human." He looked at the fire. "Splitting three trees from the inside with a thought is not."

But I'd split three trees with anger I hadn't aimed. Had made it rain from a clear sky. Had made the earth move because I was frustrated about scrolls.

"I'm afraid of me too," I said.

He looked up. Something shifted in his expression — not relief. As if my admission had changed a calculation from *doesn't know* to *knows and it doesn't help.*

We broke camp before dawn. Moving was better than sitting.

The trail should have taken us south. We'd studied Xu Ran's map, annotated in his careful hand with the route changes the world kept making. South, toward the river valley where other people lived.

But the trail didn't go south.

It had, yesterday. He'd checked. I'd watched him check. South, clearly marked, cutting between two ridges toward the valley floor. This morning, the trail went east. Into the mountains. Toward higher ground, thinner air, less life, less buffer, more isolation.

"The path changed," Xu Ran said. Flat. Not surprised. Beyond surprise, now, in the territory where anomaly was simply the operating condition.

I looked at the trail. East. Into the mountains. Into the place where my emotions would have fewer things to break and more empty space to fill.

I hadn't wanted to go east. I hadn't consciously redirected anything. But the part of me that operated without consultation had apparently decided that proximity to people was a variable to be minimized.

"We go south," I said. "Off-trail."

We went south. Off-trail. Through undergrowth that hadn't been walked and over terrain that hadn't been crossed and around obstacles that nobody had bothered to clear because nobody had ever needed this route before.

An hour later, we found a trail.

Going east.

Xu Ran stopped. Looked at the trail. Looked at me.

"You're doing this," he said.

"I'm not — I don't want to go east."

"What you want and what's happening appear to be different categories."

He was right. The gap between my conscious intention and the world's response was the thing that scared me most. I could survive being powerful. But surviving being out of control — being a force that acted according to rules I couldn't read — that sat in my stomach like cold iron.

We tried south three more times. Each time, the terrain funneled us. Not violently — no walls, no barriers, no dramatic geological intervention. Just the gentle persuasion of a landscape that kept offering east as the path of least resistance and making south increasingly difficult. A ravine here. A landslide there. A thicket of thorn-brush so dense that even qi-enhanced cutting would take hours.

By afternoon, we were going east.

I hadn't decided to go east. The world had decided for me. Or — the part of me that was becoming the world had decided for both of us.

"The sect knows," I said. We'd stopped at a stream. The water was cold and tasted of minerals and the metallic aftertaste that mountain water carries through old stone. "They've been tracking me. They'll know where we are."

"Yes."

"And they'll follow."

"Also yes."

I drank. The water tasted wrong. Not poisoned — but wrong the way things had tasted since the night I'd forgotten three things. Slightly off. Slightly distant.

"We could separate," I said.

Xu Ran refilled his flask. Capped it. Secured it.

"No," he said.

"You'd be safer."

"Probably."

"You'd be invisible. Mortal. Nobody would—"

"No."

You said no twice. As if once might not have been enough. It was.

I rubbed my temples.

"I had a dream last night," I said.

Xu Ran looked at me. Waiting.

"I don't remember it. But I woke up and there was frost on the ground in a circle around me. Just around me. Your bedroll was dry."

"I noticed."

"You didn't mention it."

"You had enough to process."

I looked at the stream. The water ran clear over smooth stones, catching light, breaking it into scattered brightness. Water going somewhere. Not deciding where. Just going.

"I'm the most dangerous thing in these mountains," I said.

"I know," Xu Ran said. He put his flask away. Adjusted his pack. "We should keep moving. East, apparently." The corner of his mouth did something that might have been humor if it hadn't been so thin.

We walked east.

The mountains received us with patient indifference. The air thinned. The vegetation thinned. Everything felt slightly unreal — as if the landscape was a draft that hadn't been finalized.

I walked. He walked behind me. Three meters — the same distance he'd always maintained.

His footsteps sounded different. Lighter. Ready.
