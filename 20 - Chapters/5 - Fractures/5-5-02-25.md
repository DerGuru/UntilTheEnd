They found us on the third day.

Not like trackers finding prey. Not by following prints or broken stems or the accumulated evidence of passage. They found us because I was broadcasting. Every emotion that broke through the wall I kept trying to build announced itself in trees and weather and the trembling of stone, and whatever instruments they used to measure qi disturbances must have been screaming like bells in a windstorm.

We'd been moving fast. Faster than comfortable, which for me meant a pace that Xu Ran set his jaw against and maintained through the stubborn refusal of a man who would not be left behind even when being left behind was the obvious tactical choice. He didn't complain. He didn't suggest slowing down. He just walked, his breath visible in the morning cold, his pack tightened to reduce movement, his notebook secured inside the waterproof case that had become as much a part of his kit as the water flask.

The sensible thing would have been to separate. I was the target. I was the one they were tracking. Without me, Xu Ran was a mortal scholar on a mountain trail: invisible, irrelevant, safe. With me, he was standing next to the epicenter of something that had already destroyed a hundred and eighty years of tree growth in a moment of poorly managed irritation.

He knew this. I knew he knew this. Neither of us mentioned it.

We crossed the river at a ford that had shrunk since the last mapped survey, either seasonal variation or one more way the world was rearranging itself around me, and I'd stopped being able to tell the difference. The water was cold. The stones beneath were smooth and slick and covered in the kind of algae that grows where water runs slow and sunlight reaches bottom. I crossed without trouble. Xu Ran crossed without trouble. The world did not react to the crossing.

Small mercies. The small mercies were the ones that kept adding up.

The sect cultivators appeared on the far bank before we'd finished wringing water from our clothes.

Fifteen of them. Not scouts. Not the cautious observers I'd scattered with the tree-splitting. These were operational. Grey robes, yes, the same anonymous fabric that the Pencil's delegation had worn, but these wore them differently. Belted tight. Sleeves tied back. Talismans not at the waist but at the forearm, where they could be activated without reaching, without conscious decision, the reflexive deployment of people who had practiced until defense became instinct.

They stood in formation. Not aggressive, at least not overtly. A crescent, open side facing us, the geometry of it communicating *we are not surrounding you* with the military precision of people who could surround us in three seconds if the conversation went wrong.

The one in front was a woman. Compact. Weathered in the way that fieldwork weathers people, not sun damage but alertness damage, the lines that come from years of watching and evaluating and deciding who is a threat and who is not. She was maybe Foundation Establishment. Solid, competent, the kind of cultivation that came from discipline rather than talent.

She held nothing. Her hands were at her sides.

"Yun," she said. Not my family name. Not a title. Just the name, spoken with the flat familiarity of someone who had been briefed extensively and no longer needed to consult notes. "We've been asked to make contact."

Xu Ran was beside me. I could feel his tension. Not in his qi, because he had none, but in the rigid stillness of a mortal body that wanted to run and was choosing not to. His breathing was too controlled. His hands were too still. He was performing calm with the desperate concentration of a man who understood that any sudden movement might be the thing that tipped the balance.

"You're the Pencil's people," I said.

A blink. The nickname hadn't traveled to her level, apparently. "Inspector Lian Zhuo has requested a formal meeting. These mountains are not safe for—"

"They're not safe because of me."

The woman paused. She had the expression of someone whose prepared speech had been interrupted at the second sentence, and the trained composure to not let that derail her. "We're aware of the anomalies. The sect's position is that—"

"You don't want to fight."

"No."

The single word hung in the air. Behind her, fourteen cultivators maintained their crescent with the stillness of people who really, genuinely, with complete sincerity, did not want to fight.

I should have found that reassuring. Instead, it made the fist in my chest clench tighter, because people who don't want to fight are people who have evaluated the fight and determined they would lose, and people who would lose and know they would lose and come anyway are people who want something badly enough to risk losing.

"What do you want?" Xu Ran asked.

He shouldn't have spoken. He was mortal. Unarmed. Irrelevant by every metric that cultivation society used to measure relevance. Speaking in this context was like a house cat addressing a kennel of war dogs. Not threatening, not offensive, just so categorically outside the power dynamic that the appropriate response was to not respond at all.

The woman looked at him. Looked at him properly, an evaluation that takes in capability, threat level, and purpose in a single glance.

"We want to understand," she said. Not to him. To me. But her eyes had stayed on him a beat too long, the way eyes stay on things that don't fit the expected pattern. A mortal. Traveling with me. Voluntarily. The math didn't add.

"The sect has recorded seventeen separate reality events in this region over the past six days," she continued. "Localized weather anomalies. Seismic micro-events. Spontaneous structural failures in organic material, trees primarily. And three instances of what our instruments classify as—" She hesitated.

"As what?"

"Retroactive continuity violations. Reality editing. Events that appear to have always been the way they are now, despite evidence that they weren't." She delivered this with the practiced detachment of someone reading a report, but her eyes were wrong. Her eyes had the brightness of someone who was afraid and had been afraid for some time and was managing that fear with professionalism and discipline and the weight of duty.

I understood then. They weren't here to fight. They weren't here to threaten or contain or negotiate.

They were here to harvest. Information. Observations. Understanding. I was the most significant cultivation anomaly any of them would encounter in their lifetimes, and the sect — the Pencil's sect, whatever its name was, wherever its roots were — had decided that understanding me was more valuable than confronting me.

I was research.

"No," I said.

The woman blinked. "We haven't—"

"No, I won't submit to examination. No, I won't demonstrate. No, I won't let your people take measurements." I could feel it building, the thing inside me that reacted to pressure, that turned emotion into force, that made trees split and weather break and the ground remember it was capable of movement. "And no, I don't know what's happening to me."

That last part was the truth, and it cost something to say it. I rubbed my temples. The headache was there again, had been there since morning, the low persistent ache that lived behind my eyes and tightened when I tried to think about things that had been taken.

"We're not asking for—"

The ground trembled.

Not hard. Not the full quake. Just a reminder — the earth clearing its throat, a polite earthquake, the geological equivalent of *I wouldn't.*

The crescent didn't break. It shifted. Three cultivators on the left side took a half-step back. Two on the right adjusted their footing. The woman in front didn't move. Her composure was better than theirs, or her fear was controlled differently, or she had simply decided that if death came it would find her in proper formation.

Xu Ran's hand was on my arm.

I didn't remember him putting it there. His grip was light. Mortal-light, the pressure of fingers that couldn't compete with qi-enhanced anything. But it was there. On my arm. Grounding.

The trembling stopped.

"We'll leave," the woman said. Her voice was steady. Her hands were not. "But the Inspector has asked me to relay a message."

She reached into her robes slowly, deliberately, with the careful movements of someone who understood that reaching into clothing near a person who made earthquakes was a gesture that required advance notice. She produced a folded paper. Not a scroll. Paper. Simple, practical, something scholars used and bureaucrats filed and nobody in the cultivation world considered impressive.

She set it on a rock between us.

"We don't want to fight, Yun," she said again. The repetition was deliberate. A phrase designed to be remembered, to echo, to become the summary of this encounter when it was recorded in whatever reports she would file.

They left. Fifteen of them, moving with the coordinated withdrawal of people who had rehearsed their exit as carefully as their entrance. No backs turned. No sudden movements. The crescent dissolved into the tree line like smoke into fog.

The paper sat on the rock.

I didn't pick it up. Xu Ran did.

He read it. His face did something I couldn't parse. Not surprise, not alarm. Something intermediate, something that lived in the space between recognition and reassessment.

"What does it say?"

He looked at me. "It says they've recorded your sleep patterns from a distance. You've been emitting qi bursts every forty-seven minutes during deep sleep." A pause. "It says that two nights ago — the night you forgot three things — the bursts stopped entirely for four hours."

Four hours. The gap. The thing I couldn't remember, the hole that pulsed behind my eyes.

Four hours of silence in a pattern of every forty-seven minutes. Four hours where whatever was inside me had gone quiet. Not sleeping, not diminished, but focused. Doing something. Taking something.

I rubbed my temples.

"Burn it," I said.

Xu Ran folded the paper and put it in his notebook.

Close enough.
