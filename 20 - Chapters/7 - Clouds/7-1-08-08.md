Silence.

The fire was down to embers: the orange-grey remnants of combustion, the late-night stage where heat remained but light was leaving and the world contracted to the circle of warmth and the darkness beyond. Stars were invisible. Clouds — the thick, low formations that had been assembling all evening — covered the sky like a lid.

Xu Ran cooked.

Like always. Like every evening of every day since the journey's beginning, the man cooked with the devotional attention of someone performing a ritual rather than a task. Water. Rice. Fire. The sequence unchanged, the outcome variable, the practice unwavering. Tonight the pot was straight; he'd hammered the dent out that morning and the metal was almost back to its original shape, the kind of repair that was functional without being invisible.

I sat.

Not meditating. Not pushing. Not attempting, not forcing, not directing conviction at the fortress of my own immortality. Just — sitting. The exhaustion of four days of failed assault, the bone-deep depletion that followed sustained effort against an unmovable surface. My body felt like it had been running for li, despite having walked only ordinary distances. The internal combat had its own physics, its own metabolics, its own exhaustion curve.

I did not eat.

The rice was there, in the bowl that Xu Ran placed near me, the placement that was close enough to reach and far enough not to pressure, the geometry of care. Steam rose from the bowl. The smell was ordinary: rice, herbs, the faint char of the bottom crust that could not be entirely eliminated even by a competent cook. The smell entered my nose and my nose forwarded the information to my brain and my brain registered: food, available, ignored.

The appetite was gone. Not grief-gone, not existentially-gone. Exhaustion-gone. The body that had spent four days fighting itself did not have the resources for hunger. Hunger was a luxury of bodies that were not engaged in civil war.

But I stayed.

Sitting. At the fire. Beside the man. With the rice I wasn't eating and the clouds I couldn't see through and the fox-spirit who was a warm weight at the edge of the dark, amber eyes reflecting the embers in two small, steady points.

I stayed because yesterday I would have left.

Yesterday — or the day before, or the day before that, at any point in the preceding four days of failure — I would have withdrawn. Into the dark. Into the solitude that felt like relief and was actually retreat. Away from the fire, away from the rice, away from the man whose presence required a kind of emotional effort that the failing immortal didn't want to spend.

Today I stayed. Not by decision but by the absence of the impulse to leave. The impulse was there, somewhere, the familiar pull toward solitude, the gravitational habit of a woman who had been alone since before alone was a concept. But the pull was weaker tonight. Not because I was stronger. Because I was too tired to obey it.

The smallest possible progress.

Xu Ran ate his rice. Carefully, attentively, with the unhurried pace of someone who understood that eating was presence and presence was companionship and companionship was the thing that kept the darkness from becoming solitude.

He did not comment on my bowl. Did not push. Did not produce the concerned-inquiry that a different person might have deployed. He let the bowl sit. Steam. Cool. The offer standing without pressure, the bowl's presence a statement: if you want, when you want, it's here.

The clouds moved overhead. Invisible except as the absence of stars. The sky should have shown stars, would have shown stars, but the thick cloud-layer swallowed them, and the sky was a dark, featureless expanse that reflected nothing and illuminated nothing and simply was.

Clouds.

Like thoughts dissolving. Like convictions softening. Like the gradual, unhurried dissipation of things that had been solid and were becoming — not nothing, but less solid. Vapor. Form without permanence. Shape without grip. The clouds were not becoming nothing. They were becoming different. Each moment, each wind-current, each temperature shift producing a different cloud, a different shape, a different arrangement of moisture and air that looked solid from a distance and was vapor up close.

Yun meant cloud.

My name. 云. The character that meant cloud, that meant the thing in the sky that formed and dissolved and reformed and dissolved and was never the same twice and was always the same thing. My name was cloud and I was the opposite of my name — solid, permanent, unchangeable, a fist where my name was an open hand.

Maybe the name was the first clue.

I sat with the thought. Did not chase it. Did not analyze or pursue or force it through the cognitive machinery that would have processed it into categories and conclusions. I let the thought sit the way the rice sat in its bowl: present, cooling, available, unforced.

The embers settled. Xu Ran finished eating. He set his bowl down and leaned back and looked at the sky he couldn't see and said nothing and the nothing was the right thing to say.

The fox-spirit's breathing was steady. Small. The rhythm of an animal that had mastered the art of being where it was without needing to be anywhere else.

A long time passed.

I reached for the rice. The bowl was cool, the steam gone, the temperature descended from comfort to room, the rice entering the state of food that has been offered and waited and is now being accepted after the normal timing has passed. I took the bowl. Held it. The weight of it, a few ounces, ceramic, ordinary.

I did not eat.

But I held the bowl, and the holding was not a fist. The holding was an open hand with something in it, the bowl's weight was real, and the rice's presence was real, and the sitting was real, and the fire was embers but the warmth was there and the man was there and I was there.

Tomorrow I would try again.

Not try — tomorrow I would be here again. At the fire. With the rice. And the man. And the not-eating that was becoming, slowly, something that might look like eating from a distance, the way not-progress was — from a certain angle, in a certain light, with a certain patience — progress.

The clouds covered the stars. I sat. The bowl cooled in my hands.

It was more than yesterday.
