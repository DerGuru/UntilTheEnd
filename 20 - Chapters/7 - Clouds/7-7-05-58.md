Spring.

The garden produces things. Small things — green shoots that become plants that become food that becomes meals that become the nutritional infrastructure of a woman learning to feed herself through effort rather than existence. The lettuce is acceptable. The beans are adequate. The tomatoes are — she planted them wrong, too close, the spatial error that a first-time gardener makes, and they compete for sunlight and soil and produce fruit that is small and determined and tastes like survival rather than cuisine.

She eats them anyway.

The market is Tuesday and Friday. She goes both days. "Loudcumber" — the vegetable seller whose volume exceeds his stall — has begun recognizing her. The recognition is not subtle.

"THE NEW ONE," he announces when she approaches. The announcement carries across three stalls and reaches customers who did not ask to be informed. "What do you want to get wrong TODAY?"

"Everything," she says.

He appears to find this acceptable. He hands her vegetables. He explains, at a volume designed for an audience of two hundred, how to select, how to store, how to prepare. He is wrong about some things. He is loudly wrong. But his tomatoes are good.

At the next stall, two women are talking. The older one — the neighbor with opinions about fences and rainfall and everyone else's gardening — is telling a story. Her hands sculpt the air into shapes that the story requires.

"She came down from the sky. Light everywhere. The whole harvest was dying and she said one word — just one — and the fields turned green again. Then she disappeared. Into light. Gone."

The younger woman nods. The nod of someone who enjoys a good story and sees no reason to doubt it.

"She walked," Yun says.

Both women turn. The new one. The quiet one who buys too many tomatoes and doesn't talk to anyone.

"She walked there," Yun says. "On her feet. And she didn't say a word. She showed the farmer where the irrigation channel was blocked. He cleared it himself. The fields recovered on their own."

The older woman stares. The stare of someone whose story has been corrected by someone who has no business correcting it.

"That's not how my mother told it," the older woman says.

"Your mother's version sounds better at least," Yun says.

The older woman considers this. Decides it is agreement. Returns to the younger woman and continues the story at the point where the woman descends from the sky, because the sky version is better and it will always be better and better is what survives.

Yun picks up her vegetables. Something in her chest is — quiet. Not the quiet of absence. The quiet of acceptance. The stories were never hers. They belonged to the people who told them, who shaped them, who needed the sky and the light and the single word more than they needed the feet and the blocked channel and the farmer who fixed it himself.

She lets it go. The way she is learning to let things go. Not by pushing. By unclenching.

She carries vegetables home. She cooks.

The cooking is — improving. The incremental trajectory of a skill being learned through repetition and failure and the educational value of meals that are bad enough to teach but not bad enough to poison. The greens are no longer mush. The rice is no longer concrete. The middle territory between disaster and competence that represents the early stages of culinary development.

Summer.

Heat. The temperature of a season that does not negotiate, that imposes its conditions on everything beneath its sky and expects compliance. She sweats. The sweating is — new. Or newly felt. The glandular response that the body produces to reduce internal temperature, the moisture-based cooling system that evolution designed and the qi once rendered unnecessary.

She sweats weeding the garden and the sweat is her body doing something her body has never needed to do and the doing is — ordinary.

Then: hunger.

Real hunger. Not the abstemious lack-of-appetite that characterized her first weeks in the village, the nutritional indifference of a body that had not required food for millennia. HUNGER. The biological signal — the stomach contracting, the muscular compression that the digestive system performs when it is empty and would like not to be.

The sound comes first. A growl. Low. From the anatomical region that hunger inhabits — the abdomen, the gut, the central processing facility of a digestive system that is, for the first time in millennia, operating at the volume that evolution intended.

She looks down. At her stomach. At the source of a sound she has not heard from her own body in — ever? The question is genuine. Has she EVER been hungry? The child in the cave must have been. The early version of herself must have eaten from necessity. But the memory is gone and the hunger is new and the sound is —

"That was me?" she says.

To the air. To the garden. To no one. The rhetorical question of a woman confronting a bodily function that she has only observed in others, the way a person born without the capacity for sneezing might react to their first sneeze.

She eats. Standing in the kitchen. An apple — from the market, from Loudcumber, who selected it for her with the aggressive care that constituted his customer service model. The apple is crisp. Sour-sweet. The juice runs along her chin and she wipes it with the back of her hand and the wiping is — human. Unremarkable. The unselfconscious gesture of a person eating a piece of fruit and managing the consequences.

the hunger recedes. Satisfied. The biochemical satisfaction that follows caloric intake after caloric deficit — the stomach quieting, the system acknowledging receipt, the digestive partnership between organism and food performing its ancient function.

She stands in the kitchen, apple core in hand, juice on her chin, and the moment is — complete. Not significant. Complete the way all small moments are complete: self-contained, fully realized, requiring no interpretation.

The fox-spirit appears at the kitchen door. Its gaze fixed on the apple core. The feline-canine calculation of an animal assessing whether a thing is food.

"No," she says.

The bright eyes disagree but accept.

Summer continues. The garden grows. She sweats. She eats. She sleeps — every night, dreamlessly, the recuperative unconsciousness that her body requires because she is a body now and bodies have requirements.

She learns to cook beans. The beans are acceptable. She learns to cook rice. The rice is mediocre. She learns the temporal patience that cooking requires — the waiting, the not-interfering, the restraint of allowing heat and time to do their work without the cook's anxious intervention.

The seasons accumulate. The days stack. The time flows through her and each second departs and does not return and the departing is not loss.

It is counting.
