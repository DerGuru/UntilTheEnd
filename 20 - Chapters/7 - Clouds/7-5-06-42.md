She sits on the stone floor and the stone holds her with the indifferent support that stone provides to everything placed upon it.

Her hands rest on her knees. Open. Upward. The posture of not-gripping, the physical configuration of palms that have decided — or have been too exhausted to decide otherwise — to stop holding.

The dark is thorough. Not the darkness of night, which the sky salts with stars and the horizon outlines with silhouette. Cave-dark. The complete absence of photons, the visual silence of a space that light has abandoned.

She sits in the dark because the dark is where she is.

A sound. Not the dripping — deeper, lower, the acoustic signature of stone settling. The geological micro-movement that mountains produce over centuries, compressed into an audible instant. A click. A shift. The cave adjusting its relationship with the earth the way all structures adjust their relationship with the forces that hold them.

She breathes. The breath is visible to no one, audible to no one, productive of nothing except the continuation of a process that continues regardless.

The fear is still there.

She examines it the way she examines everything now — from INSIDE. With the intimacy of someone who has discovered that the specimen is her own rib cage.

The fear has texture. Smooth in places — the worn areas where she's handled it without knowing, the patina that develops on frequently touched surfaces. Rough in others — the raw edges, the places where the fear meets the rest of her without transition, the abrupt boundaries between afraid and everything else.

The fear has weight. Not the metaphorical weight of a burden — the physical weight of a presence that occupies space in her chest, that displaces other things, that takes up room. It sits in the chest. Below the sternum. Above the diaphragm. In the anatomical real estate that the body reserves for feelings too fundamental to live anywhere peripheral.

She sits with it.

Sitting. The way you sit with weather. The way you sit with a landscape. The way you sit with something that is going to be there regardless of your position on the matter and therefore requires cohabitation rather than resolution.

A gust of wind through the cave mouth. Cold. The thermal intrusion that caves accept — the atmospheric breath of the mountain entering the mountain's lungs. The fire's remains stir. Ash lifts and settles.

Different. She is different from yesterday. It was invisible yesterday. Today it is visible. It was unnamed yesterday. Today it is named. It was abstract yesterday. Today it is located: chest, below sternum, above diaphragm. The cartography of an emotion that has been living in her body for millennia and has only now been given an address.

The address does not help.

But the having of an address changes the relationship. The difference between afraid-of-something-nameless and afraid-of-death is the difference between lost and lost-with-a-map. The map does not make the terrain passable. The map makes the terrain knowable. And knowledge is — the terrain itself. The ground on which the next step will be taken. Whatever that step is.

She stands.

The standing is heavy — the gravitational honesty that the seven seconds introduced and the reflex did not completely retract. Her legs have weight. Her body has mass. The sensation is novel in the way that something can be novel after millennia: not surprising but NOTICEABLE, the quality of being noticed rather than the quality of being new.

She walks to the cave mouth. The light arrives — the diffuse grey of an overcast sky filtering into the cave entrance, the illumination of a world that is lit but muted, present but overcast.

The stone beneath her feet is rough. She feels the texture through her shoes — the tactile information that the soles transmit, the geological braille of a cave floor communicating its composition to the feet walking on it.

She stands at the mouth. Looks out. The mountain is there. The clouds are there. The geography of a high-altitude landscape that does not care about her fear or her understanding or her three stages of approach.

The wind touches her face. Cold. Real. Felt.

She stands at the threshold between dark and light, between inside and outside, between the place where the truth was felt and the place where the truth must be lived.

The fox-spirit emerges beside her. Amber eyes blinking at the grey light. It shakes itself — the full-body shudder that animals perform upon transition from rest to motion, the physical reboot of a creature switching states.

She stands. She breathes. The air tastes of rain.

Nobody tells her what to do next.

She decides anyway.
