Night. The roof.

She climbs up the way she has learned — hand over hand on the wooden ladder that leans against the back wall, the technical ascent that the house's architecture provides, the rungs worn smooth by previous climbers who presumably had their own reasons for wanting to be above their ceilings.

The roof is flat. Stone tiles. Still warm from the afternoon sun — the thermal residue of a surface that has been absorbing heat all day and is now releasing it with the patient generosity of stone.

She lies down. Back against the warm tiles. Face to the sky.

Stars. The astronomical density of a night sky at altitude with no cloud cover and no light pollution — the Milky Way visible, the constellations packed so tight they lose their individual identity and merge into the general statement of the universe being LARGE.

She looks.

Two paths.

The seeing has been gradual — assembled across days, across the incremental understanding that has accrued since she first spoke the fear. But now, on this roof, under these stars, the seeing is complete. Two paths. Clear. Final. No third option.

One: dissolve the Dao. Release the warping. Let the conviction go — completely, totally, the absolute release that would convert her from what she is to what everything else is. She dies. Genuinely. Permanently. The cells stop holding. The qi stops shielding. The body does what bodies do when the supernatural support is withdrawn: it ages, it degrades, it ends. But: the warping that has been unconsciously stabilizing — things, places, patterns — for millennia also ends. What happens then? She does not know. Chaos, perhaps. Perhaps not.

Two: expand the Dao fully. Push the warping to its logical conclusion — not just herself but everything. Nothing dies. Nothing ends. Nothing CAN end. Every living thing held in the permanent stasis that her power provides, the universal extension of her personal immortality. Everything continues forever. Beautiful. And the worst possible outcome. An existence without endings is an existence without meaning, a story without a final page, the eternal paralysis that makes immortality a sentence rather than a gift.

No middle ground. She cannot become "a little" mortal. The conviction does not negotiate.

A shooting star.

The bright line across the dark — the atmospheric combustion of a fragment too small to survive entry, the brief spectacular death of something that traveled millions of kilometers to burn up in three seconds. The trail fades. The darkness absorbs it.

Wei would have said: "Make a wish."

And she would have said: "Be quiet."

And he would have laughed. Or not. Wei laughed rarely and the rarity was what made the laughs worth cataloging.

She lies on the roof and the stars are overhead and Wei's face is in her memory — not the painful face, not the grief-face, not the face that used to produce destruction-radius silence. The calm face. The dying face. The face that was — even at the end, even at the absolute terminal point of his existence — unimpressed.

He had no fear.

Not bravery — bravery required the presence of fear and the decision to act despite it. Wei had no fear. The absence was not achieved, not cultivated, not the product of training or practice or spiritual development. The absence was CONGENITAL. Wei did not fear death the way some people did not fear heights — not through courage but through the way he was built, a constitution that simply did not produce the response.

He could let go because there was nothing to hold.

The parallel is imperfect. She is not Wei. She has fear — fear large enough to build a world around. Fear old enough to predate most civilizations. Fear deep enough to live in the bones. She cannot achieve Wei's absence. She cannot subtract the fear from the self.

But acceptance. Acceptance is a different mathematics. Not subtraction but integration. Not removing the fear but housing it. Living with it. Walking with it the way she walks with weight and breathing with it the way she breathes with air and being with it the way she is with everything else that is permanent and unremovable and part of the landscape of being alive.

The stars turn. The rotation of the sky that is actually the rotation of the earth, the planet spinning beneath the stars with the majestic indifference of a body that has been spinning for four billion years and has no plans to stop.

The choice is made.

Not as decision — she does not decide. The choice is made the way weather is made: by conditions, by pressure, by the configuration of forces that produce an outcome without anyone choosing the outcome. She KNOWS what she will do. Has perhaps always known. The knowing has been waiting — beneath the fear, beneath the wall, beneath the conviction — for the conditions to permit it to surface.

She will let go.

The stars turn. The roof is warm. The village sleeps below.

She lies on her back with her choice and her fear and the space between them, which is narrower than it has ever been and which is closing, slowly, with the patient inevitability of something that has been closing since the beginning and is almost closed.
