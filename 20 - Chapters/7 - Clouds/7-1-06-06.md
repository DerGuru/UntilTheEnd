The world did not want to be near me.

We noticed it on the second day of climbing. The animals first — a pair of mountain deer that had been grazing on the sparse scrub a hundred meters from our camp. They raised their heads when I approached. Not the alert-but-assessing posture of animals encountering a potential threat. The instant, full-body flinch of animals encountering something WRONG. They ran. Not trotted — ran, the panicked, inefficient galloping of creatures whose instinct-processor had received a signal that bypassed the evaluation stage entirely and went straight to: leave.

Then the birds. The morning bird-sounds — the ambient, unremarkable chatter of species communicating about territory and food and the routine logistics of avian existence — stopped. Not faded. Stopped. A radius of silence that moved with me like a shadow, the quiet that existed within a circle whose center was wherever I was standing.

The fox-spirit was immune. Or indifferent. Or operating on a frequency that didn't register the same wrongness that the other animals detected. It trotted beside me, amber eyes forward, unbothered by the silence or the fleeing or the fact that the natural world was evacuating in a sixty-meter radius around the immortal woman who was trying to die.

Then the plants.

Not immediately — plants were slower to respond, their biology operating on timescales that made animal panic look impatient. But by the second afternoon, it was visible. The scrub grass within range of our camp was leaning. Not growing — leaning, the blades and stems tilting inward toward me the way sunflowers orient toward light, except this orientation was toward something that was not light. Something else. Something that the plants could sense through roots and cells and whatever mechanism plants used to detect forces that humans couldn't name.

Xu Ran was cooking.

Rice. The last of the foraged grains he'd found in a wild patch two valleys back, supplemented with some bitter herbs and the kind of improvisational protein that mountain cooking required. The pot was on the fire. The fire was adequate. The scenario was ordinary.

The pot dented.

He was watching the rice, monitoring the bubble-rate, performing the culinary calculus that informed his cooking — and the pot dented. The metal surface — thin iron, road-forged, the kind of pot that traveling merchants sold and scholars bought because it was light and functional — pressed inward. A small indentation appeared on the side facing me, as if an invisible thumb had pushed into the metal from outside.

"I am currently burning my rice," Xu Ran said, "because your qi is deforming the pot."

I looked. The pot. The dent. The rice inside, cooking unevenly because the heat distribution had been altered by the deformation.

I blinked.

"It's doing it again," he said. Not alarmed — Xu Ran didn't alarm. Observational. Clinical. The calm, measured tone of a man documenting a phenomenon while the phenomenon was actively ruining his dinner. "Your qi. I can feel it — not like before, not the discharge. More like... pressure. Ambient. Constant. Three meters in every direction, roughly. Everything within three meters is being — compressed. Slightly."

I looked at my hands. They were doing nothing. They were resting on my knees, open, still, not gripping, not producing qi intentionally. And yet: the pot was dented. The grass was leaning. The birds were gone.

"I'm sorry," I said.

The words came out before I processed them — the automatic apology of someone who is causing damage without intent, the reflexive social response to being the source of inconvenience. Sorry. But to what? To the pot? To the rice? To Xu Ran's dinner? To the sixty meters of evacuated wildlife?

To everything.

To the world that twitched and bent and fled because inside of me was a conviction so massive that its gravitational pull was distorting the physical space around it, the way a dense object distorts the fabric of space itself. I was immortal the way a star was massive — not as a quality but as a force, and the force affected everything in range, and the range was growing, and I couldn't turn it off because turning it off would require not being what I was.

Xu Ran served the rice. Uneven, slightly burned on the dented side, otherwise acceptable. He ate. I— looked at the bowl.

The appetite was absent. Not gone in the grief-sense of those first years after Wei, not absent in the existential-void sense of the field. Just — not there. The body that didn't need food wasn't producing the signals that requested food, and the mind that was exhausted from three days of pushing against itself didn't have the energy to override the body's indifference.

"Eat," he said.

"I'm not hungry."

"Eat anyway."

The flat insistence of a man who understood that biological nourishment was irrelevant and symbolic nourishment was not. He pushed the bowl toward me. The way — Wei. The pushed bowl. Be quiet. Eat.

I didn't eat.

But I stayed sitting. At the fire. With the rice I wasn't eating and the man who was and the fox-spirit who had found its spot at the edge of the disturbed radius and was sleeping with the commitment of an animal that had decided the universe's problems were not its problems tonight.

I stayed.

Clouds moved across the stars. Thick tonight — the accumulated moisture of the mountain range assembling into the heavy, low formations that promised rain. The stars appeared and disappeared behind the cloud-cover, flickering like uncertain lights, the sky itself unsure whether to reveal or conceal.

Xu Ran washed the pot. The dent was still there.

"I'll fix that tomorrow," he said.

He would. With a stone, probably, and the pragmatism of a man who responded to supernatural phenomena with mechanical solutions. The pot would be un-dented. The morning would come. The practice would resume.

I sat. The rice cooled. The clouds covered the stars.

It was more than yesterday.

Yesterday I would have walked away. Into the dark. Into the solitude that felt safer than the company. Today I was sitting at a fire I hadn't built, beside a person I hadn't asked for, with a meal I wasn't eating.

It was the smallest possible progress. It was enough.
