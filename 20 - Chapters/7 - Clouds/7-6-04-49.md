The plum tree is already there.

Old. Knobbed. The gnarled architecture of a tree that has been growing in the same soil for decades, the trunk thick and twisted with the sculptural confidence of a plant that has survived seasons that weaker plants did not. The bark is grey-brown. The branches spread in the asymmetric pattern that real growth produces — no two limbs the same length, no angle repeated, the botanical asymmetry that designed trees achieve and ornamental trees imitate.

Blossoms. Pink and white. The color-gradient that plum trees produce in the season of the climate — petals that are pink at the edge and white at the center and produce the overall impression of a canopy that is blushing. The scent is — she breathes. Sweet. Light. The particular olfactory signature that plum blossoms generate, the chemical compound that the tree produces for pollination purposes and that humans experience as beauty.

She sits beneath it. Back against the trunk. The bark rough against her back — through the fabric, through the layers, the tactile information of the tree's surface pressing into her spine with the insistence of something that has been here longer than she has and is not adjusting to accommodate her.

Eyes open. The meditation — if this is meditation, if the word still applies to what she is doing — happens with eyes open. She sits and the garden is there and the village is there and a child is playing somewhere three houses away and the sound of the child is real and present and part of the meditation rather than separate from it.

She breathes.

The fear is there.

She lets it in.

She LETS IT IN. Opens the door — the interior door that has been held closed for millennia, that was built by a child in a cave and maintained by a woman on a mountain and reinforced by every mechanism of survival that her body could deploy. She opens it.

It comes through.

It is large. Larger than the room it was kept in. The expansion of a confined thing released into a larger space — filling the garden, the village, the sky, the unlimited volume that the interior provides when the interior stops partitioning. It is EVERYWHERE. In her chest. In her throat. In her fingertips that tingle. In the somatic territory of a body that is experiencing the complete, unfiltered presence of the thing it has been filtering for millennia.

She drowns.

That is the accurate verb. It is an ocean and she is in it and there is no surface and no bottom and no shore and the drowning is the all-encompassing experience of being submerged in something total.

And she breathes.

Both. Simultaneously. Drowning and breathing. The impossibility of the combination is the point — the paradox of a woman who is completely submerged in fear and completely alive and the completeness of both states does not cancel but coexists. She drowns. She breathes.

A petal falls.

From the plum tree. Dislodged by wind — the light gust that moves through the garden, the atmospheric breath that the afternoon produces as thermal currents adjust. The petal descends in the spiral that petals follow — not straight, not predictable, the aerodynamic uncertainty of a flat light object falling through air. It lands on her hand.

Pink. Light. Warm from the sun.

She looks at it.

It screams. It is screaming — has been screaming since she opened the door, the sustained vocal output of a feeling that has been confined and is now free and is using its freedom to express its full volume. The scream is interior — cellular, molecular, the frequency that every part of her body generates when the survival mechanism registers that the gates are open.

She listens.

The way you listen to rain. Receiving it. Letting each drop arrive and pass. Listening. The passive reception of a sound that exists because it exists and will continue because it continues and carries on without your participation.

She listens to it the way she listens to rain.

And it gets quieter.

Still present. Still audible. But quieter. The gradual diminishment that occurs when the listener stops resisting and the sound discovers that resistance was part of its fuel and without the fuel the sound — continues. But softer. Less. The volume dropping not because the source is weaker but because the amplifier has been removed.

The amplifier was resistance. The resistance is gone. It continues. Quieter.

She sits under the plum tree with a petal on her hand and it in her chest and it is quieter than it was a minute ago and the quiet is — not peace. Not yet. But the space in which peace might grow, the cleared ground that precedes planting, the silence that precedes sound.

A bird sings. Real. Heard.

She sits. She lets it go.

The petal lifts from her hand — wind again, the gentle removal that air performs on objects too light to resist. The petal joins the air. Joins the wind. Joins the atmospheric medium that carries all light things and is called — she does not name it. She watches it go.

The fear is still there. In the chest. In the garden.

But it is quieter.

A second petal lands on her hand.
