The burst came without warning.

That was the nature of it — the cruelty of a power that operated below conscious access, the involuntary reflex of reality-shaping firing before the mind could intervene. There was no buildup. No sensation of gathering. No internal tremor that could serve as alarm. There was the moment before and the moment after and between them: annihilation.

I was thinking about the nest.

Not this nest — not yet. I was thinking about a nest I'd seen years ago. Decades. Centuries. The blur of time that made it impossible to locate the memory precisely. A bird's nest in a plum tree — three eggs, speckled, warm. I'd touched one. The shell had been thin enough to feel the life inside, the fragility that separated existence from absence, the membrane between being and not-being that was thinner than paper and stronger than intent.

I was thinking about how fragile things survived.

And the world broke.

The trees went first. Not fell — went. The word "disintegrate" implied a process, a sequential dismantling of structure into component parts, but there was no sequence. The trees within a hundred steps simply stopped being trees. The trunks became dust. The branches became memory. The leaves became nothing — not even absence, because absence required something to be absent from. The trees were there and then they were nowhere and the transition occupied no time.

The sound wasn't a sound. It was the hush of a hundred trees ceasing to exist simultaneously — the vacuum that formed where mass had been, the momentary silence of air rushing to fill the space that matter had evacuated. Then: the rush. Wind from all directions, converging on the circle of nothing I'd created.

I stood at the center.

The grass withered outward from my feet in a perfect circle, the green becoming brown becoming grey becoming dust, a ring of death expanding at the speed of feeling and then stopping — abruptly, completely, the way a shout stops when the mouth closes.

The fog cleared. Of course it did. The fog had been mine too.

In the cleared air, the damage was worse than the experience of causing it. A circle of devastation — a hundred steps in every direction. Bare earth where forest had been. Dust settling. The silence that followed destruction, the world holding its breath in the aftermath of violence.

Xu Ran was on the ground.

He'd ducked. Instinct — the body's response to a pressure wave that shouldn't have existed, the physical shockwave that accompanied the erasure of a small forest. He was unhurt. The circle had been precise in its destruction, a geometrically perfect expression of an imprecise emotion, and he had been — barely — outside its radius.

"A warning," he said, standing, brushing dust from his sleeves, "would have been nice."

I didn't answer. I couldn't. The aftermath of the burst was physical — trembling limbs, hollow chest, the exhaustion that followed involuntary expenditure, the body paying the tax for something the mind had signed without reading.

Then I saw the nest.

It had been in one of the trees — the trees that were now dust, the trees that had been the boundary of the destruction. The nest was on the ground. It was intact — almost. The structural weave of the bowl was preserved, the architecture of twigs and moss and down that the mother had spent days constructing, the home she had built with the only tools available to her.

Three eggs. Broken.

Not crushed — the shockwave had cracked them, the internal pressure of a reality-shift propagating through shells that evolution had designed to withstand everything except this. The yolks pooled yellow on the brown earth. The embryos inside — visible, half-formed, the tiny translucent bodies of birds that would never —

The mother was beside the nest. Dead. Not from impact. From proximity. She had been in the tree when the tree ceased to exist and she had survived the fall but not the — I didn't know what to call it. The residual. The leftover. The toxicity of a space where reality had been forcibly rearranged, the environmental damage that my emotions inflicted on things too small to notice and too alive to withstand.

I knelt.

Three eggs. Three lives. Three futures that had been as real as breathing and were now as real as the trees — which was to say: not at all.

The mother's feathers were brown and ordinary. She'd been a sparrow, maybe. Something common. Something that existed in numbers large enough to absorb losses like this without species-level consequence. The math of survival — populations could sustain casualties, percentages were resilient, the aggregate could absorb the individual's destruction without breaking.

The math didn't help.

I stared at the broken shells and the dead bird and the circle of nothing that I'd made without choosing to and my hands were shaking and the shaking wasn't grief and wasn't anger and wasn't anything with a name. It was the tremor of a being confronting the mechanical consequences of her own existence.

Xu Ran stood at the edge of the circle. He had his brush out. He was writing.

He didn't say anything about the nest. He didn't say anything about the bird. He wrote and the writing was his response and the response was permanent in a way that words wouldn't have been.

The smell of burned feathers reached me — faint, organic, the chemical signature of keratin exposed to forces it was never designed to encounter. The smell was wrong. Not the wrong of distance or abstraction but the wrong of proximity, the wrongness of a consequence you could hold in your hands.

I stood. My legs were uncertain. The exhaustion was deep, the kind that lived in the bones rather than the muscles, the cellular fatigue of a body that had converted feeling into physics without consent.

Around us, the mountain was quiet. The birds that remained had fled. The insects had gone silent. The hush of a landscape in shock — the living world's response to a predator event, the collective breath-holding of creatures who had survived by virtue of distance.

I looked at my hands. They were ordinary hands. They had lines and joints and the wear of a body that had existed for millennia without changing. They didn't look like weapons.

They were.

"We're moving," I said.

"Now?"

"Now."

We left the circle behind us. The dust was settling. The eggs were cooling. The mother was still.

The smell of burned feathers followed us down the trail.
