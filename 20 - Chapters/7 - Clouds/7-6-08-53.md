She climbs down from the roof.

Carefully. Bare feet on the ladder rungs — when did she take off her shoes? She does not remember. The unconscious act of removing footwear, the body's decision to be unshodden made without the mind's participation or approval.

The grass.

Her feet touch it. Cool. Wet from dew — the pre-dawn moisture that forms when the air temperature drops below the dew point and the water in the atmosphere decides to become water on the surfaces

She stands.

The grass under her soles is — she has felt grass before. Thousands of times. Millions. The tactile experience of plant matter beneath skin, the botanical carpet that covers the earth's temperate zones. She has walked on grass for millennia.

This is different.

The feeling is different because the feeling is COMPLETE. Unfiltered. Raw. The grass is — every blade. Each one. Individual. The sharp-soft sensation of vegetable architecture pressing against the sole's nerve endings, the detailed report that the foot sends to the brain when the brain is actually listening.

She stands in the grass and feels the grass and the feeling is — more.

More than grass should be. More than any single sensation should provide. The overwhelming input of a nervous system that has been receiving filtered data for millennia and is now, briefly, receiving raw signal. The world LOUD. The world PRESENT. The world HERE.

A breath. Deep. Quiet. Still.

A breath. The respiratory event that occurs between one moment and the next, the exchange of gases that her lungs perform as default function. But this breath — this, individual, particular breath — releases fully.

Every breath she has taken for millennia has held. At the top of the inhalation — the brief, invisible, undetectable moment where the air sits in the lungs before being released — every breath has held. Has gripped. Has maintained the micro-contraction that kept her body's state locked in place.

This breath releases.

This breath rises. Crests. Falls. Without the grip. Without the pause. Without the invisible hand that catches the top of the inhalation and squeezes for one microsecond and releases and squeezes again on the next breath and the next and the next for millennia.

She exhales.

The exhale is — she stands in the grass and the exhale leaves her and she is — lighter? The same weight. But the weight is — distributed differently. Carried differently. Held differently, because the holding is — different.

Loose.

The word from the roof. The knot. The conviction. Loose.

She walks to the door. The grass under each step is individual and exact and present. The doorframe is wood. The handle is iron. The door opens inward. The house is dark.

The bed is hard. The mineral firmness that the mattress has always offered, the uncompromising surface that provides support without comfort. She has slept on it — how many nights? The counting is uncertain. The days in the village have accumulated without formal tracking, the temporal accumulation of a life that is not counting because counting implies that the number matters.

She lies down. The pillow is thin. The blanket is adequate.

She closes her eyes.

And sleeps.

The sleep is dreamless. True dreamless — the quality of sleep that occurs when the mind has nothing to process, when the internal machinery that converts experience into dream has nothing to convert because the experience has been processed while awake.

The sleep is — peaceful.

The peace of a woman who is tired and is lying down and is sleeping. The ordinary peace. The human peace. The peace that billions of people experience every night and take for granted because they have never known its absence.

She sleeps.

The village sleeps around her. The stars continue. The fox-spirit sleeps at the foot of the bed, eyes closed, body warm.

Outside, the first light touches the ridge.
