She stands.

The standing takes longer than it should — or takes exactly as long as it should, the duration of a body that is experiencing its own weight with a fidelity it has not experienced in millennia. The legs push. The muscles contract. The joints negotiate with gravity in the mechanical conversation that standing requires, the biomechanical dialogue between bone and tendon and the downward pull that the earth applies to everything without exception.

She is heavier. Only slightly, a marginal increase, a fractional addition, the subtle shift that distinguishes "weight deflected by qi" from "weight experienced by body." Her feet press into the floor with a force that the floorboards register, the wood receiving her weight with the quiet creak that loaded surfaces produce.

She looks at her hands. The same hands. The same shape, the same proportions, the same lines. But different. Identical to the eye. SENSORILY different. She feels them the way she has not felt them in — she loses count. The feeling is: these are HERS. Human hands. With nerve endings that report sensation without the qi's editorial intervention.

She makes a fist. Opens it. The voluntary test of motor function: the fingers curling, the tendons pulling, the palm contracting, the release. Ordinary. Functional. The mechanical performance of a hand doing what hands do.

She goes to the garden.

The garden is growing. The seeds she planted: growing. Without warping. Without belief. Without the supernatural acceleration that her power has been providing unconsciously for — how long? Since the planting? Since earlier? Since always? The uncertain duration of a woman who has been shaping reality without knowing and is now seeing reality without shaping.

The shoots are green. Small. The modest growth that time and soil and water produce when they are left to operate without interference. The plants are growing at the pace plants grow, the biological clock that measures progress in days rather than seconds, the patient accumulation of cellular division that produces visible change only through patience.

She kneels. The knees register the ground: hard, cool, the information-rich surface of garden soil that her senses process into awareness: damp, rocky, uneven. She touches a shoot. The leaf is small and new and the tender green that indicates youth and vulnerability and the beginning of something that needs time.

Then — something else.

The warping. The reality warping — the power that has been operating in the background of her existence for millennia, the continuous intervention that she has been performing on the world without intention or awareness — recedes.

Not disappears. Recedes. Like a tide returning to the sea. The gradual withdrawal of water from shore — the line of wet sand moving oceanward, the incremental departure of something that has been present for so long that its presence was the baseline and its absence is the novelty.

She feels it go.

The world around her — the garden, the house, the village, the mountain above, the sky above the mountain — settles. Only settles. The adjustment of a reality that has been held in a configuration by a force and is now being released from that configuration. The adjustment is minimal. Almost nothing. The world was mostly as it was. Her warping had been subtle. Unconscious. The low-level, background-noise warping that she had been performing for millennia: keeping the rain slightly to the side, keeping the temperature slightly comfortable, keeping the small animals slightly distant, keeping the reality slightly aligned with her preference.

All of it: receding.

The world IS. Simply. On its own. Independent of her intervention, her shaping, her believing, her warping. The garden grows because gardens grow. The sun shines because suns shine. The wind blows because wind blows. The magnificent simplicity of a reality that operates under its own rules without the addition of a woman's unconscious preferences.

She sits in the garden. The soil is damp beneath her. A bug crosses her hand, a small brown thing with too many legs and the purposeful movement of an insect that has somewhere to be and does not consider the surface it is crossing. She watches it.

The bug does not detour around her. Does not sense the qi-perimeter that has been diverting small creatures for millennia. Walks across her hand. Across her wrist. Continues into the grass.

She watches it go.

The morning is warm. The sun is ordinary. The air smells of earth and green and the organic signature of a garden in early growth, the chemical announcement that life is proceeding at its natural pace.

The memories come.

All of them. Simultaneously. Beyond the sequential flood of the telling, beyond the cascade of names and faces that arrived in order and overwhelmed through volume. ALL of them. At once. Thousands of years. Millions of moments. Every face. Every name. Every place. Every season. Every loss. Every gain. Every breath.

ALL.

The sensation lasts — one second? Two? The temporal compression of a lifetime into a moment, the biographical singularity of everything happening in the same instant.

Then: silence.

The memories settle. Still present. Settled. The way snow settles. The way dust settles. The way everything that has been in the air eventually finds the ground and rests on it and becomes part of it.

She remembers everything. And it is acceptable. Painless. Light. Free of the burden that memories have been for millennia. The memories are HERS and she is theirs and the mutual belonging is not a prison but a history. Her history. Complete. The way a book is complete when the last word has been written even though the reader hasn't reached it yet.

Peace.

The word arrives not as thought but as state. She is at peace. A different thing from happiness, apart from the bright spike of satisfaction or the reward the body provides for achieving goals. Peace is the absence of war. The cessation of conflict. The post-combat quiet of a self that has been fighting itself for millennia and has stopped.

She sits in the garden. The bugs cross her hands. The shoots grow. The sun is warm.

She is at peace.
