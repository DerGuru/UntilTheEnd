Evening. First evening in the house.

The candle on the table produces a circle of light that is smaller than she expected — the limited illumination of a single flame, the radius of visibility that one wick achieves when one wick is all that is available. The table smells of old wood. Cedar, maybe. Or oak. She has known the difference for centuries. It does not matter.

The fear is in the room.

Not figuratively. The fear occupies space — has presence, has weight, has the atmospheric density of something that is THERE. It sits in the corner. Not the corner specifically — the word "corner" is a convenience, a spatial approximation for something that has no spatial properties but requires spatial language to be described. The fear is IN the room the way the air is in the room: everywhere, invisible, breathable.

She does not fight it.

This is new. This is the conscious, deliberate, exact decision to NOT engage the fear as adversary. Not because she cannot — the reflex is there, the survival mechanism is operational, the wall stands ready to deploy at the first sign of combat. But because combat is the problem. Combat is what she has been doing. Combat is the mode of engagement that treats the fear as opponent and therefore perpetuates the opposition.

She sits at the table. In the candlelight. With the fear.

The candle flickers. Wind from the window — the frame does not seal properly, the architectural imperfection of a house built for utility rather than comfort, the draft entering through the gap between wood and wall. The flame bends. Recovers. The shadow on the wall moves and returns.

She breathes. The fear breathes. The candle breathes.

A knock.

The sound is external — real, physical, the acoustic event of knuckles on wood. The door. Someone is at the door.

She opens it.

A woman. Short. Wide. The physical configuration that village life produces — bodies built by labor rather than exercise, shaped by function rather than intention. She holds a pot. The pot steams.

"I thought you might need —" The woman holds the pot higher. Rice. The lid is slightly askew and the steam escapes in the thin curl that indicates fresh cooking, recent heat, food that was made for one household and is being shared with another. "The rest from dinner."

"Thank you."

"You're thin."

The observation is delivered without preliminary, without softening, without the social padding that urban interaction requires. Direct. Unasked. This is how village neighbors are — the social contract including the right to comment on the body of a stranger who has moved in next door, the communal intimacy of communities too small for anonymity.

The woman notices the fox-spirit on the bed. Her eyebrows rise — not alarm, not concern, the moderate elevation that indicates surprise without judgment. "Pretty animal." She sets the pot on the table. "Eat." Not a suggestion.

She leaves. The door closes. The pot sits on the table beside the candle, the steam rising into the circle of light.

She eats.

The rice tastes like other-people's-rice. Not like Xu Ran's burned offering. Not like the mediocre consistency that his cooking produced. This rice is competent. Seasoned. Made by hands that understand rice the way her hands once understood medicinal paste — through repetition, through practice, through the accumulated skill of doing one thing often enough that the doing becomes excellent without becoming remarkable.

She eats slowly. The jaw works. The tongue tastes. The throat swallows. The body accepts the nutrition with the quiet compliance of a body performing its function.

The candle burns lower. The pot empties — mostly. She leaves some. Not from lack of appetite but from the domestic instinct that says return the pot with remains as acknowledgment that the pot was received and used and appreciated.

The fear is still there.

She sits in the half-dark — the candle reduced to its last centimeter, the light contracting, the circle shrinking — and the fear is present. In the room. In the air. In the atmospheric density that she has been living with since the cave, since the seven seconds, since the bones.

But — quieter?

Or has she grown accustomed? The distinction is unclear. Perhaps there is no distinction. Perhaps growing accustomed IS getting quieter, the two processes being identical rather than analogous, the fear's volume and the listener's tolerance being inverse functions of the same variable.

She sits with the fear and does not fight it and the not-fighting is — something.

Not victory. Not acceptance, quite. Something between the two that does not have a word yet but might develop one if given enough time.

Having fear is not being fear. The distinction is thin. The distinction is real. The distinction is the space in which a woman sits at a table eating a neighbor's rice while the thing that has defined her for millennia sits in the room and she does not ask it to leave.

The candle goes out.

The dark is familiar now.

She goes to bed.
