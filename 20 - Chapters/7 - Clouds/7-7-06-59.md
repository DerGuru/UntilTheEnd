Rain.

The first real rain since... she cannot identify the comparison. It has rained before. Rain has fallen on her before. For millennia rain has fallen on her and the rain has been irrelevant, the qi deflecting it, keeping her dry, the meteorological event of precipitation sliding off her the way it slides off stone.

This rain does not slide off.

She is in the garden when it starts. The clouds, grey, low, the atmospheric configuration that precedes precipitation, open, and the water comes down with the intensity of a mountain rain, the vertical assault of droplets that have been formed at altitude and have gained velocity through descent.

She gets wet.

ACTUALLY wet. Clothing darkening, hair flattening, skin receiving the individual impacts of droplets that arrive with the force of small objects traveling at terminal velocity. Each drop: felt. Each drop: a separate event. The tactile information that rain provides when the shield is gone.

She stands in the garden in the rain and the rain is on her and she is WET and the wetness is — indescribable. The novelty of a sensation that billions of people experience and complain about and take for granted and she has never — NEVER — experienced in its full unfiltered magnitude.

The water runs down her face. Along her nose. Drips from her chin. The temperature is cool, not cold, not the numbing cold of winter rain, but the fresh cool of summer rain, the temperature that wakes the skin up rather than shutting it down.

A voice. From next door. The neighbor, standing in her doorway, dry, the position of a person who has had the sense to come in from the rain.

"COME IN. You'll get sick!"

The irony.

She — who has been unable to get sick for millennia. She — whose body has rejected every pathogen, deflected every infection, maintained perfect health through the supernatural immunity that the qi provided. She — getting sick.

Can she get sick? The question is genuine. The answer is: maybe. Probably. The qi is still flowing but no longer holding, no longer defending with the absolute commitment that characterized its previous operation. The immune system is operating. But it is operating as an IMMUNE SYSTEM rather than as an impenetrable barrier. Subject to challenge. Potentially subject to defeat.

She goes inside. Dripping. The floor receives her water with the quiet acceptance of wood that has been rained on before. She changes clothes. Dry fabric against wet skin. The sensation is acute, the comfort-gradient between wet and dry amplified by the novelty of having been genuinely wet.

Autumn.

The plum tree drops its leaves. The garden retreats. The seasonal surrender that temperate vegetation performs: the chlorophyll departing, the green becoming yellow becoming brown becoming mulch. She watches the transformation with the attention of someone who has seen thousands of autumns but has never FELT one, never experienced the cooling as cooling rather than as data, never watched the leaves fall with the personal implication that seasons have when seasons apply to you.

A voice. Small. From the fence.

"Seven."

She turns. The Counter — the child who counts stones, who counts steps, who counts everything that can be enumerated and treats the enumeration as sacred duty — stands at the garden fence. Small. Brown hair. The configuration of a child in late afternoon light, the face serious with the gravity of important work.

"Seven what?" she says.

"Your wrinkles."

She blinks. The child is looking at her face with the analytical intensity that the child applies to all counted things: the objective assessment, the numerical cataloging, the inventory taken without sentiment or agenda.

"You had one," the child says. "Now you have seven."

"You counted my wrinkles?"

"I count everything."

The statement is delivered as fact. The declarative confidence of a child who has identified her purpose and is not seeking permission. I count everything. The comprehensive mandate of a small person whose relationship with the world is mathematical.

She looks at the child. The child looks at her. The exchange is — brief and enormous. Brief because neither of them has anything to add. Enormous because a child has counted her wrinkles and the counting means she is aging and the aging means she is mortal and the mortality is NOT a thought but a FACT observable by a child who does not know what she is counting, who is counting wrinkles the way she counts stones, with the same methodical precision and the same numerical respect.

Seven.

She smiles.

A smile. Small. Real.

The child nods. Satisfied. The count has been performed. The result has been noted. The Counter turns and walks back down the lane, counting something else. Steps, probably, the numerical progression of feet on earth.

"Seven," the child says. To herself. Moving on.

The festival is small. Three streets. Paper lanterns, handmade, lopsided, the uneven craft of village hands that produce beauty through effort rather than precision. They hang from the eaves and the fence posts and the one tree at the intersection where paths converge. The light they produce is orange and unsteady and warm.

The neighbor brings mooncakes. Dense, sweet, the compressed pastry that the season demands. She eats one standing by the well, the lotus paste sticking to her teeth, the texture unfamiliar and comforting in the way that unfamiliar things become comforting when they arrive at the right time.

The Counter counts the lanterns. Fourteen. She announces this to no one in particular. Fourteen lanterns. The village's entire luminous inventory, cataloged and confirmed.

Small. An ordinary evening in an ordinary village with ordinary lanterns and ordinary mooncakes and the ordinary gathering of people who live near each other and have decided, without discussion, that nearness is enough.

She stands in the orange light and the light is on her face and the face has seven wrinkles and the wrinkles are — lit.

Winter.

Cold. Real cold. The cold that the qi once negated is now the cold that blankets and fire and the human technology of warmth-retention manage. She builds fires, daily, the domestic combustion that winter requires, the relationship between flame and survival that has been humanity's oldest technology.

She drinks hot tea. The tea is bad. She has accepted that her tea will always be bad and the acceptance is a form of self-knowledge.

The fox-spirit curls by the fire. Amber eyes closed. The total relaxation of an animal in a warm place, the body surrendered to the heat with the complete trust that warmth is trustworthy.

Seven wrinkles. One grey hair. A woman who sweats and hungers and gets wet and gets cold.

A life.
