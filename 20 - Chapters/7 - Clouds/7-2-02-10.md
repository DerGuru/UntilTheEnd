The plant bloomed.

Not immediately. Not in the sudden, mechanical way of a latch releasing — not the instant response to a command. The bud sat in its pot, closed, green-tight, the compressed potential of a thing that hadn't yet decided to become itself. Xu Ran had bought it at the last village — haggled, overpaid, complained about the price per stem ratio with the indignant thoroughness of a scholar who believed market economics should be governed by the same principles as logic. The plant had survived the climb in his pack, wrapped in damp cloth, the care of a man transporting experimental equipment.

The morning was overcast. Low clouds sat on the ridgeline above us, grey and patient, weather that could hold for hours without committing to rain. The clearing smelled of wet stone and the residual smoke of last night's fire. Xu Ran had set the pot on a flat rock beside the plant, and the water inside reflected the cloud-cover in its small, dark circle.

"When you're ready," he said.

He was sitting cross-legged, three meters back. Notebook open, brush horizontal across the page, the prepared stillness of a man who understood that documentation required patience and patience required posture. The fox-spirit had found a boulder at the clearing's edge and was watching with the amber-eyed neutrality of a creature that assessed all phenomena — blooming plants, rising water, breakfast — with equal detachment.

I looked at the bud.

Not willed. Knew. The bloom was — there. Already present, already contained in the tight spiral of petals, already real, waiting only for the arrangement of conditions that would allow the contained thing to express itself. I didn't make the plant bloom. I knew the plant was blooming. The distinction was the lesson.

The petals opened.

Slowly. One, then another, then a third, the spiral unwinding with the patient inevitability of a thing returning to a state it had always preferred. Pink at the edges — the pink of wild mountain flowers, deeper than cherry blossom, lighter than plum, the color of something that had chosen its pigment without human consultation. White toward the center. Yellow at the heart — the concentrated yolk-yellow of pistil and stamen, the reproductive apparatus that the bloom existed to showcase.

The scent arrived. Faint. Sweet in a way that wasn't sugar-sweet but earth-sweet — the fragrance of organic process, of cells opening and releasing the volatile compounds they'd been storing, the olfactory signature of life continuing.

Xu Ran breathed in.

The expression on his face was — I filed it. Stored it in the memory-archive alongside the moments worth keeping. His face, in the presence of a flower that shouldn't have opened, did something I hadn't seen before. The clinical mask didn't crack — it dissolved. For a duration measured in heartbeats, the man behind the scholar was visible: wonder, unprocessed, un-categorized, the raw human response to beauty that preceded thought.

Then the mask reformed. He was a scholar again. He noted the bloom's diameter (writing), the petal count (writing), the estimated acceleration of the growth cycle (writing). But for those heartbeats, he had been only a man watching a flower open.

"How long did that take?" he asked. Clinical again. Measuring.

"I don't know. I wasn't counting."

"Eight breaths. Start to full bloom. Eight breaths for a process that should take days."

He wrote the number. Underlined it. Drew a small box around the underline, which was his notation for data points he considered structurally important. The notebook was developing its own visual language — a taxonomy of margins and marks that only he could read and that would, one day, be the only record of what happened on this mountain.

"Again?" he said.

I looked at the bloom. Full. Open. Complete. The petals at their widest extension, the pistil exposed, the scent strongest now. To bloom it again I would need to — what? Un-bloom it first? Will the petals closed and then know them open?

"I don't think it works backward," I said.

"Why not?"

The question was genuine. His voice carried the specific tone of a scholar encountering an assumption and choosing to test it rather than accept it. Why not. Everything else, after all, had been possible. Water rose. Stones cracked. Trees bent. Why shouldn't a flower un-bloom?

"Because I knew it was blooming. I didn't know it was closing. The knowing has to be — true. At some level. The bloom IS the natural direction. Closing would be — forcing."

He considered. Wrote something. Probably a notation about the directional constraint of conviction-based reality manipulation, in fewer characters than I'd used to explain it.

The cloud-cover held. The morning remained grey, diffused, the light even and shadowless. A bird called from somewhere beyond the clearing's edge — tentative, a single note, the first sound of wildlife testing the boundary of the quiet radius.

I did not mention his face. Some observations were better left unrecorded.
