The memory came with the beauty.

Not because beauty triggered pain — that equation had belonged to the grief-years, the knife-edged association between anything good and the loss that good reminded her of. This was different. The beauty of the blooming plant and the rising drop had opened something. A window. A clear view into a memory that was warm instead of sharp.

Wei.

Some moment. His life. A pause in the walking, maybe, or a morning in the settlement, or one of the thousand undocumented instants that constituted the actual texture of a shared existence. He was there. Alive, present, the physical reality of a boy who occupied space and displaced air and produced the continuous low-level chaos of a stubborn human being interacting with a world that wasn't prepared for his brand of intensity.

"You're ancient, aren't you," he said.

Not a question. Wei's questions were never questions — they were statements presented in interrogative packaging, the conclusions of a mind that had already decided and was offering you the courtesy of disagreement before ignoring it.

"Be quiet," I had said.

The memory was six sentences long. Eight, maybe. Barely a scene. A fragment. Wei's face, the arrangement of features that constituted his expression of absolute, unshakeable certainty. The way he looked at her when he knew something she hadn't confirmed. The eyes — direct, too direct, the gaze of a person who had never learned to look away because looking away implied a hierarchy and Wei did not do hierarchy.

"You're ancient, aren't you."

And the warmth. The non-romantic, undefined warmth that existed between them in the spaces between words. He knew what she was — not the details, not the mechanism, not the full architecture of her condition. He knew in the way that a person knows rain is coming: body-knowledge, atmosphere-knowledge, the felt sense of something too large to prove and too present to deny.

She had said be quiet and he had been quiet and his quietness had been louder than his words.

"Wei?" Xu Ran said.

I opened my eyes. The clearing. The training equipment: bowl, plant, extinguished candle. The mountain morning. Xu Ran sitting across from me, brush poised, the alertness of a man who had learned to read her expression the way a navigator reads weather.

"Be quiet," I said.

The same words. Different reasons. Then: deflection. Hiding. Now: protection. The memory was too tender to share, too private, too fragile. Like a water drop that would fall if observed too closely. She said be quiet not because the memory was painful but because it was precious and precious things broke when you handled them in public.

Xu Ran set the brush down. Did not write. His hands — open, resting on his knees, the posture of a man who understood that this moment did not belong to the notebook. Some data was not data. Some observations were sacred.

The warmth of the memory remained — a low heat, like embers, like the residual temperature of a fire that has been out long enough to stop being fire but not long enough to stop being warm. Wei was there. Had always been there. In the substrate of her memory, in the deepest layers, in the place where the oldest convictions lived alongside the oldest losses.

The grief had changed.

Not less — she would never claim less. The grief was the same mass, the same weight, the same fundamental quantity of loss. But the shape had changed. After Wei, the grief had been a blade: narrow, sharp, cutting. Then later, a weight: heavy, broad, pressing. Then at the field, an absence: the geometry of a space where something had been and wasn't. Now the grief was a warmth. The radiation of something that had existed intensely. Their existence continued to emit heat even after the source was gone.

She missed him.

The missing was not agony. The missing was — the quality of attention that you give to a person who is not present but whose presence has shaped the space so thoroughly that the space still contains their outline. She missed him the way a room misses its furniture: quietly, in outline.

"He would have liked this," I said.

Xu Ran waited.

"The drop. The plant. He would have liked seeing it. Would have said something — stupid. Obvious. 'Do it again.' Would have tried to make the water move himself. Failed. Said something about it. Grinned."

My voice was steady. The steadiness of someone speaking about a loss that has been carried long enough to become part of the carrying structure rather than the load.

Xu Ran nodded. He didn't pick up the brush. He nodded and was quiet and the quiet was right.

The fox-spirit was near. Closer than usual — the amber eyes at my feet, the warm body curled against my ankle. It had no opinion about grief. It had warmth, which was sufficient.

You didn't pick up the brush. That was the first time you chose silence over documentation, and it told me more than anything you ever recorded.
