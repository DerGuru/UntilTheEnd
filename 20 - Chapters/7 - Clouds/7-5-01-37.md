The mountain path is steep and grey and empty.

She walks. One foot, then the other, the mechanical repetition of a body doing what bodies do on inclines — the muscular negotiation between weight and gradient, the knees absorbing, the ankles adjusting, the architecture of locomotion performing its ancient function without consultation.

The clouds sit above the ridgeline. They do not move. Heavy, flat, the atmospheric weight of clouds that have decided to stay — formations that resist the wind's suggestions and hold their position with the stubborn certainty of objects that have forgotten they are vapor.

She is alone.

The silence is different. Not the working silence of two people walking together without speaking — that silence has a floor, has the structural support of another person's breathing and footsteps and the knowledge that speech is available even when unused. This silence has no floor. This silence goes all the way down.

The fox-spirit is ahead. A rust-colored shape on the grey stone, moving with the efficient gait of an animal that does not require companionship but tolerates proximity. Its amber eyes catch the light when it turns — brief, bright, the only color on the monochrome trail.

Wind.

The wind is cold. Not abstractly cold — not the theoretical cold that her qi deflects automatically, the environmental temperature that has been irrelevant for millennia because the body's defense has been absolute and autonomous and uninterrupted. This cold is different. This cold is ACTUAL.

Her fingertips are blue.

She stops. She looks at her hands. The pause of a woman noticing something that should not be possible — the halt in stride, the raised hands, the visual inspection of a phenomenon that contradicts everything the body has been doing for longer than most mountains have been mountains.

Blue. The tips of her fingers. The cyanotic shade that cold produces in exposed flesh, the vascular response of blood retreating from extremities to preserve the core, the triage decision that the circulatory system makes when heat is insufficient. Her body is making that decision. Her body has NEVER made that decision.

For one breath — one single, measurable, countable breath — her qi has not shielded her.

For one breath, she is exposed.

She exhales onto her hands. The warm air meets the cold skin and the warmth is — hers. Produced by her lungs, by the thermal output of a respiratory system performing its function. She rubs her hands together. The friction generates heat. The heat is mechanical, not metaphysical, not qi-driven, not the supernatural warmth of a being whose body maintains itself through forces that exceed physics.

She rubs her hands together like a human.

The moment is beautiful. And terrifying. And the two things are not separate — they occupy the same space, the identical temporal and emotional territory, the beauty and the terror coexisting in the narrow window of a woman discovering that her hands can be cold.

The blue retreats. The qi returns — subtle, automatic, the defense mechanism reasserting itself the way a sleeping guard resumes position after a momentary lapse. The fingertips warm. The color returns. The body is protected again, shielded again, immortal again.

But the blue was there.

She looks at her hands. The blue is gone. The evidence is gone. The fingertips are their ordinary color — the non-color of skin that has existed for millennia without changing, without aging, without responding to the environment because the environment has been irrelevant.

Three seconds of cold. Three seconds of blue. Three seconds of human.

The path continues upward. Into the mountains. Toward — she does not name the destination. The destination exists as direction rather than location, as trajectory rather than point. Upward. Into the cold. Into the work.

The fox-spirit waits on a rock. Amber eyes. Patient. The animal patience that does not distinguish between delay and purpose, that treats all pauses as equivalent and resumes movement when movement resumes.

She walks. The wind blows. The cold is — ordinary cold now, deflected cold, the environmental temperature that exists outside the qi's perimeter and does not penetrate.

But three seconds ago it penetrated.

The clouds above the ridge do not move. Heavy. Grey. Waiting.

She climbs.
