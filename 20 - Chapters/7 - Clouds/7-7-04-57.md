The wrinkle appears on a Tuesday.

She does not know why the day matters. It does not matter. But the precision of it — Tuesday, market day, the day she goes to the stalls and lets the loud man tell her which vegetables she needs — anchors the discovery in the calendar of ordinary life. A Tuesday. A morning. A basin of water on the wooden table, serving as mirror because mirrors are a luxury the house does not provide.

She bends over the basin to wash her face. The water is cool. The reflected face is — hers. The same face she has seen for millennia. The same proportions, the same arrangement of features, the same fundamental geometry that has been fixed since — since.

Except.

The wrinkle. One. Left side. Beside the eye. Small. Fine. The surface crease that time produces when time is allowed to produce — the dermal evidence of lived expression, of muscles contracting and releasing in the same patterns for long enough that the skin remembers the contraction and maintains it as permanent record.

She touches it. Index finger. Traces it. The line is shallow — a crack in the surface, a hairline fissure in the material of her skin that has been smooth for millennia and is now, for the first time, recording the passage of time in its texture.

Like a line on a map.

A line on a map of a country that she has never visited. A country called aging. A country that everyone inhabits except her. Until now.

She straightens. She looks at the face in the basin and the face has a wrinkle and the wrinkle is — she does not have a word for what the wrinkle is. Not alarming. Not distressing. Not the trigger for the existential dread that narratives assign to the discovery of aging in previously young-appearing characters.

Fascinating.

"So that's what it feels like," she says. To the face. To the basin. To the house that contains her and the wrinkle and the morning.

The grey hair comes later. That afternoon. In the garden, under the plum tree, she runs her hand through her hair — the absent gesture that bodies perform without conscious direction, the self-grooming that occupies idle hands — and finds it. One strand. Not silver. Grey. The particular shade that constitutes the transition between pigmented and un-pigmented, the color of keratin expressing the reduction of melanin.

She pulls it. Holds it against the light. The strand catches the sun differently — the optical behavior of grey hair versus black hair, the refractive properties altered by the chemical change.

She turns it in the light. Holds it between thumb and forefinger. Studies it with the observational attention that a researcher applies to a specimen — the close examination, the detailed inspection, the fascination of someone encountering something new.

Everything is new.

That is the extraordinary thing. Everything. Every physical sensation, every bodily change, every small sign of the time that is now flowing through her rather than around her. After millennia of sameness, the smallest change is — revelation. A wrinkle. A grey hair. The modest evidence of mortality performing its work on a body that has been exempt from the work for longer than most civilizations have existed.

A knock. The front door. She opens it.

The neighbor. The short, wide woman who brought rice on the first night and has continued appearing with the regularity of a village neighbor who has decided that the new resident requires supervision. She stands in the doorway and looks at the woman who has opened it and her eyes do what the neighbor's eyes always do: assess. Quickly. Thoroughly. Without apology.

"You have wrinkles," the neighbor says.

"One."

"Wrinkles come from laughing."

She considers this. The physiological claim is partially accurate — the repetitive muscular contraction associated with laughter does contribute to the dermal creasing that forms around the eyes and mouth. Partially. Other contractions contribute as well: squinting, frowning, the general expressive use of facial musculature that living produces.

"I don't laugh," she says.

The neighbor looks at her. The direct gaze of a woman who has lived in this village for decades and has developed opinions about everything and shares them with the casual generosity of someone who considers opinions a public service.

"Then start," the neighbor says.

She turns and leaves. No follow-up. No elaboration. The conversational economy of a woman who says what she means and then removes herself from the conversation before the meaning can be diluted by discussion.

She stands in the doorway. The neighbor walks down the path. The afternoon is warm. The garden is growing. The grey hair is still in her hand — she has been holding it throughout the conversation, the strand between her fingers, the filament of evidence.

She lets it go. The wind takes it. The grey hair joins the air and disappears.

She goes back to the basin. Looks at the wrinkle again. Traces it again.

Then — not a smile. Not quite. But the muscular rearrangement that precedes a smile, the preparatory configuration of facial architecture that indicates the possibility is being considered.

Tomorrow, perhaps.
