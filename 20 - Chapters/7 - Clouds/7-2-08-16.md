The inventory of mastery was short and devastating.

Water: yes. I could redirect flow, raise drops, still a surface, accelerate current. The belief that water behaved differently was easy to hold — water was external, other, subject to a conviction that didn't threaten the conviction's own architecture.

Plants: yes. Bloom, grow, wilt, reverse. The biological machinery of vegetation responded to my knowing the way a stringed instrument responded to a bow — directly, obediently, with the resonance of a thing that had been waiting for input.

Light: yes. Bend, concentrate, dim. The photons — or whatever photons were before anyone named them photons — followed the path that my conviction established for them. A shadow could be relocated. A beam could be curved. Darkness could be persuaded to be less dark.

Temperature: yes. The ambient heat of a space could be raised or lowered by knowing it differently. The fire burned hotter when I knew it burned hotter. The water cooled when I knew it cooled. Thermodynamics was — optional.

Gravity: yes. The drop. The leaves. Objects could be convinced that down was elsewhere. Not easily, not for long, but yes.

Everything outward: yes.

Inward: no.

"I am mortal." Nothing. The words hit the inner architecture and died.

"My finger could bleed." The hesitation — once. A single, heartbeat-long flicker. Not reproducible. Not sustained. The qi had wavered and then re-established with the speed of a structure that had been running failsafe protocols for millennia.

I reported this to Xu Ran with the emotional distance of someone filing a status report.

"Water, plants, light, temperature, gravity," I said. "All controllable. Everything external responds. Everything internal doesn't."

He was sitting against his boulder. Notebook open. The brush idle — he'd stopped writing and was thinking, the stillness that indicated his mind was working on a problem that the brush couldn't help with.

"The eye can't see itself," he repeated.

"You said that yesterday."

"It wasn't less true today."

I looked at the sky. The clouds were — different today. Lower. Heavier. The compressed cloud-cover of mountain weather approaching decision: rain or not, storm or drift, the atmospheric equivalent of a coin in the air.

"Maybe you're too close," he said again. "To yourself. The tool works on everything EXCEPT the toolmaker. Because the toolmaker IS the tool. The conviction that shapes reality is the same conviction that constitutes your reality. You can't use yourself to change yourself because the using is the self that needs changing."

"That's what you said last time. The paradox."

"Have you solved it?"

"No."

"Then it bears repeating."

He was right and the rightness was a wall. The same wall, described from different angles, illuminated by different lights, but the same wall. She could change everything — any physical law, any material condition, any arrangement of the world that existed outside the boundary of her own body — and she could change nothing about herself, because the changing was the self that needed to be changed.

"What if," I said, "the answer is not changing. What if the answer is — what we talked about. Stopping the holding."

"You tried that."

"I tried willing myself to stop holding. Which is — holding."

"You tried not-willing yourself to stop holding."

"Also holding."

He almost smiled. Not the warm kind — the grim kind. The recognition of an absurdity that was also a prison. The joke that was not a joke because the woman telling it was actually trapped inside it.

"There has to be a way," he said. "You exist. You weren't always immortal. At some point, the conviction formed. If it formed, it can un-form."

"Formation was unconscious."

"Then un-formation must also be unconscious."

The logic was — I sat with it. The conviction hadn't been built by decision. It had accumulated, layer by layer, in the cave, in the cold, in the solitude. Each survival a brick. Each day of not-dying a layer of mortar. The building had built itself, without architect, without plan, without the intervention of a conscious mind directing the construction.

To demolish it — wouldn't demolishing also need to be unconscious? Not a decision but a process? Not a choice but an accumulation in the opposite direction?

But accumulation took time. The conviction had taken millennia. The un-conviction would take — 

"Patience," Xu Ran said. As if reading the calculation. "The one thing you have no shortage of."

I looked at him. The man who would die. Who was dying, in the slow-motion way that all mortals died, cell by cell, day by day, the inexorable subtraction that constituted mortal existence. He was telling her to be patient. He, who had maybe thirty years left. Maybe forty. A heartbeat, in her scale.

I didn't say that.

"Patience," I agreed.

The cloud-cover decided: rain. The first drops hit the rocks with the small, distinct impacts of water meeting stone — the same sound the cave had made, the same sound that had been her first clock, her first heartbeat, her first proof that the world was still running.

We moved under a rock overhang. The rain came harder.
