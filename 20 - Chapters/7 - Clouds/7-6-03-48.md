Morning. The garden.

She stands in the overgrown space behind the house and looks at what needs doing. The weeds are thick — the aggressive vegetation of neglected soil, plants that have taken the absence of human intervention as permission to occupy every available centimeter. Stones. Debris. The remains of whatever the previous tenant grew, long since returned to the undifferentiated organic matter that all cultivation becomes without maintenance.

She digs.

With a shovel — borrowed from the landlord, the exchange of tool-for-promise that village economies facilitate, the temporary redistribution of resources based on need and proximity. The shovel is iron and wood and rust in the places where iron meets moisture without intervention. The handle is smooth from use.

The earth is cool. Damp. When she lifts it, the underside is darker — the mineral gradient that distinguishes surface from depth, the geological stratification of centimeters that register in color and texture and smell.

Under her nails: black.

Earth. Real earth. The organic substrate that is simply dirt beneath fingernails because a woman is digging with insufficient tools and insufficient technique and the dirt is indifferent to her qualifications.

She makes rows. Approximate. The imprecise geometry of a gardener who knows the principle but not the practice, who understands that seeds require spacing but is uncertain about the optimal distance. She overcompensates in some places. Undercompensates in others. The rows are — adequate.

Seeds. From the market. She bought them two days ago — a small paper packet, the packaging of agricultural retail, the folded paper that contains possibilities she cannot see. She does not know exactly what will grow. She COULD know — the warping would tell her, the reality-sensing capacity that her power provides would identify the seed type and predict the growth pattern and forecast the harvest with precision that no farmer could match.

She leaves the warping alone.

She places the seeds in the rows. One by one. The manual labor of planting — fingers in soil, seed in hole, soil over seed. The gesture is old. Pre-agricultural old. The human action that predates civilization, the fundamental relationship between hand and earth that started everything.

She places them in the earth and covers them and the covering is sufficient and the sufficiency is — the whole point.

Planting. Waiting. Letting.

The parallel is obvious and she lets it lie because dwelling is a form of pushing and pushing is the thing she has set aside.

"Water?"

A voice. Next door. The fence between her garden and the neighbor's is low — three boards, decorative rather than functional, the architectural gesture that says "this is mine" without adding "and you cannot enter." A man stands at the fence. Thin. The angular thinness of a body that works more than it eats, the caloric deficit recorded in the angles of jaw and shoulder and wrist.

"My well runs slow this time of year," he says. He gestures at his own plot — smaller than hers, more maintained, but dry. The soil is pale. The plants are — trying. The botanical effort of vegetation that wants to live but lacks the water to thrive.

She nods. "Take what you need."

He does. Her well — the shared well, technically, the communal water source that serves this end of the village — produces enough. He fills a bucket. Carries it to his plot. Pours. The water darkens the pale soil in the immediate way that water darkens earth — the visual confirmation of irrigation, the chromatic evidence of moisture meeting mineral.

"Thank you," he says.

He returns to his garden. She returns to hers.

The exchange is — small. Human-scaled. The interpersonal transaction that requires no power, no warping, no supernatural capacity of any kind. A woman with water shares with a man without water. The economy of need and availability, the simplest exchange that human community facilitates.

She kneels in the dirt. Her knees are damp. The earth is under her nails. The seeds are in the ground. The sun is overhead and the clouds are present and the village noises — children, roosters, the thin man's bucket clanking — are the acoustic evidence of a world operating without her intervention.

She lets the seeds be. She lets the germination happen at its own pace. She lets the garden produce what it will.

She waits.

The waiting is the active choice to step back, the deliberate exercise of restraint that is harder than action because action has momentum and restraint has only intention. She waits the way the earth waits — patiently, without expectation, with the geological confidence that things will happen when things happen and the timing is not hers to determine.

The fox-spirit watches from the doorstep. Eyes on the garden. On the woman in the dirt. On the human comedy of someone who can reshape reality choosing instead to use a shovel.

She washes her hands at the well. The water is cold. The earth dissolves from her nails slowly, reluctantly, the attachment of soil to skin that says: you worked here.

She dries her hands on her clothes.

The seeds are in the ground.

That is enough for today.
