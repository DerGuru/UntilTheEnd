The guilt was a circle.

I'd been walking it for two days — the mental circumnavigation that guilt produced, the track worn by repetitive thinking, the path that went nowhere because it went everywhere and the everywhere was always the same place. Destruction. Cause. Self. Repeat.

Xu Ran saw it before I named it.

"Stop," he said.

We were on the trail. The afternoon sun was behind the clouds — clouds that might have been mine, clouds that might have been weather, the uncertainty that had become the background radiation of every observation. The fox-spirit was ahead of us, a rust-colored shape on the grey trail, moving with the efficiency of an animal that knew where it was going even when no one else did.

"Stop what?" I said.

"That leads nowhere."

"What does?"

"The thing you're doing. The loop. I can see it — you've been walking the same thought for two days. It starts with the nest. Goes to Wei. Goes to every other loss. Arrives at guilt. Returns to the nest. Starts again."

The precision was offensive. The irritation of being accurately described by someone who had been watching with more attention than I'd authorized — the documentary eye seeing the structure of the spiral when the person spiraling could only see the motion.

"How would you know?" I said.

The question was defensive. The deployment of challenge-as-shield, the rhetorical maneuver that substituted aggression for vulnerability. I knew how he knew. He knew because he was observant and because the signs were visible and because two days of circular thinking produced behavioral patterns that a trained observer could read like text.

But his answer was different.

"Because I think that way," Xu Ran said.

The words landed with the weight of confession. Not the dramatic confession — not the tearful revelation, not the wounded disclosure that narrative demanded and life rarely provided. The flat confession. The factual. The Xu Ran register of truth-telling that placed information in the air without decoration and let it stand.

"Guilt as circle," he said. "I know that pattern. The loop. Event, cause, self, repeat. The mental architecture that converts regret into repetition and repetition into — nothing. It doesn't arrive anywhere. It doesn't resolve. It just —"

He made a gesture. Circular. His hand describing the trajectory of a thought that went around and around and never touched ground.

"You?" I said.

"Yes."

"About what?"

The pause. Not the editorial pause — this was different. The silence of a man deciding how much of himself to disclose, the internal negotiation between privacy and relevance, the calculation of how much personal truth was required to serve the pedagogical moment.

He decided on less.

"That doesn't matter right now," he said. "What matters is: the guilt doesn't go anywhere. It's not productive. It's not useful. It doesn't prevent the next event or repair the last one. It's just — movement without progress. Energy without work. Heat without light."

"So what do you do?" I asked.

He looked at me. The direct gaze that he used when he was about to say something that was simultaneously helpful and disappointing, the visual equivalent of medicine that tasted bad and worked.

"I cook rice," he said.

He set down his pack. He started a fire. He put the pot on. He began the procedure — the water, the grain, the proportions that produced edible results, the mechanical sequence that he performed with the methodical attention of a man who understood that the procedure WAS the point.

I watched.

"That's it?" I said.

"That's it."

"You — cook rice."

"Yes."

"And the guilt?"

"Stays. But stays smaller. Stays — contained. The rice doesn't fix anything. The rice is rice. But the making of rice requires attention and attention can only be in one place and if attention is on the rice then attention is not on the loop."

The fire was catching. The pot was heating. The water was beginning the slow transition from cold to warm to hot, the thermal narrative that preceded boiling, the patient escalation that couldn't be rushed.

He added the grain. He stirred. He watched the water the way he watched everything — with the completeness of a man who had decided that this, right now, was the most important thing happening, and the decision was absolute.

I sat. Not because he told me to. Not because the thought-loop released me. But because the fire was warm and the rice was cooking and the domestic normalcy of a man preparing food on a mountain trail was — something. Not a solution. Not an answer. Something.

The guilt was still there. The nest. The three eggs. Wei's silence. The thousand names and the thousand faces and the thousand small destructions that I had committed unknowingly across millennia. All of it was still there, still circling, still the mental perpetual motion machine that guilt constructed when given enough material.

But Xu Ran was cooking rice.

And the rice required a pot and the pot required fire and the fire required attention and attention was — redirected. Not stopped. Not fixed. Redirected. The water flowing into a different channel, not because the old channel was blocked but because a new one was available and gravity was indifferent to which channel it used.

His past. The thing he hadn't disclosed. It sat in the air between us — visible by its absence, the shape of an untold story outlined by the space it occupied. He knew the guilt-loop because he walked it too. He knew the circle because he'd been a resident. The rice wasn't theoretical advice. It was practiced knowledge, the wisdom that came from repetition rather than insight.

He cooked rice because he'd needed to cook rice. For himself. For his own loop. His own circle. His own —

I didn't ask. The not-asking was its own kind of respect — the acknowledgment that some silences were inhabited and the inhabitants had the right to their tenancy.

The rice was ready. He portioned it. Two bowls. The equality of shared meals, the democratic distribution of nutrition that rendered all other hierarchies temporarily irrelevant.

"Here," he said.

He held out the bowl. The rice was steaming. The smell was — rice. The unremarkable scent of a grain that had been cooked in a pot on a fire on a mountain by a man who was trying to help a woman stop thinking in circles.

I took the bowl.

The loop didn't stop. But the loop had a competitor now, and the competitor was holding a spoon.
