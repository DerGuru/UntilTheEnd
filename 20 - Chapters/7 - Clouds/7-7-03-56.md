The change is not immediate. It arrives over days — the incremental accumulation of difference that the body registers before the mind can name.

Her qi has changed.

Changed, not diminished. The distinction matters. For millennia, her qi has HELD. The internal clenching, cellular, molecular, deeper-than-conscious, that maintained the body in its fixed state. A fist around the self. Every particle of energy devoted to the single imperative: preserve. Continue. Hold.

Now: the fist opens. And the qi FLOWS.

Through her. Flowing through, never away. The way water flows through a riverbed, the way air flows through a corridor, the unobstructed transit of energy moving along paths that were designed for movement and have been blocked for millennia and are now — open.

The sensation is — she stops walking. On the path between her house and the market. Stops and stands and feels the qi MOVING inside her body with the fluid freedom of something that has been dammed and is now released. Slowly. Without catastrophe, without the violence of a dam breaking. The gradual, patient, correct release of water flowing where water is meant to flow.

Natural. For the first time since a child in a cave decided otherwise: natural.

And she feels TIME.

Not as concept. Not as the intellectual understanding that has been available for millennia — the philosophical awareness that time passes, that moments are sequential, that the present becomes the past and the future becomes the present. Not that. She feels time the way a body feels weight. As STREAM. As current. As the visceral experience of something flowing through her that is not energy but duration.

Every second: present and then gone. Irretrievable. The one-directional flow that mortality provides — the arrow that points in only one direction and cannot be reversed and cannot be stopped and cannot be slowed.

Instead of fear: fascination.

She stands on the path and feels time flowing through her body the way water flows through the riverbed and the feeling is — extraordinary. New. The novelty of a sensation that billions of human beings experience every second of their lives and take for granted because they have never known its absence. She has known its absence. She has lived without it for millennia. And now: time. Moving. Through her. Each second a small departure. Each moment a small goodbye.

Her skin feels thinner. Still resilient, but thinner. The reduced density that the body produces when the qi stops reinforcing every cellular structure to maximum specification. She touches her forearm. The skin gives under the pressure of her fingertip — a slight indentation, a brief impressibility, the elastic response that skin produces when skin is doing what skin does without supernatural assistance.

She walks to the market.

The market is noise and color and the organized chaos that commerce produces in spaces too small for the commerce they contain. Stalls. Awnings. The particular smell of fresh produce and dried goods and the human contribution of bodies working in proximity.

A voice — loud. Louder than necessary. The decibel excess of a man who has decided that volume is a sales strategy and has committed to the decision with the absolute conviction that only merchants possess.

"SQUEEZE IT."

A man behind a vegetable stall. Wide face. Thick arms. The physical configuration of someone who has been lifting crates of produce since before the lifting became easy. He holds a tomato toward her — red, round, the Platonic form of a tomato.

"If it gives," he says, still at full volume despite the proximity of a meter, "it's ripe."

She squeezes. The tomato gives — slightly, the elastic response of fruit at the correct point in its ripeness curve, the brief deformation that indicates readiness.

"See?" he says. "EASY."

She buys the tomato. And several other things that he insists she needs and she probably does because she does not know how to identify good produce. She has never needed to know. The qi provided. The qi no longer provides.

She walks home with vegetables she selected through the instruction of a man who yells and a tomato that gives when squeezed.

In the garden, she cooks. She does not know what to do with the vegetables. The knowledge gap of a woman who has eaten for millennia without needing to and is now navigating the relationship between raw ingredient and prepared meal without the intuition that practice provides.

She overcooks the greens. Underseasons the rice. The result is food. Technically. The minimum threshold that separates nutrition from raw ingredient, the culinary basement that effort achieves when effort is unaccompanied by skill.

She eats. Standing. In the kitchen. The food is mediocre. The mediocrity is hers.

Every second: present and then gone.

She feels the seconds going.

Fascinating.
