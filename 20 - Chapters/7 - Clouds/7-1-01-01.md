"Start," Xu Ran said.

We were sitting. The where didn't matter — camp, mountain path, the side of a trail that led upward into the ranges where the vegetation thinned and the air became something you noticed instead of something you breathed. The where didn't matter because the where was not what he was asking about.

"With what?" I said.

He had his notebook open. The brush resting across the page, the ink stone balanced on his knee, the full apparatus of a scholar preparing to document. He looked at me the way a physician looks at a patient who has been postponing the examination — patient, firm, ready.

"Tell me who you are."

Silence.

Not the comfortable silence of two people who have run out of things to say. The structural silence — the load-bearing kind, the silence that exists because the weight of what needs to be said is too heavy for words to carry without preparation. The silence that precedes the lifting of something immense.

I looked at the sky. Clouds — thin, scattered, the high-altitude wisps that existed more as suggestions than as weather. They moved. Slowly, indifferently, with the unhurried drift of things that had no destination and no schedule and no responsibility to anyone watching.

"I'm tired," I said.

Truth. Not evasion, not deflection, not the strategic misdirection that earlier versions of myself might have deployed. Simple, factual, body-deep truth. I was tired. Had been tired since before the twist, since before the eons of accumulated existence had compacted themselves into a weight that sat between my lungs and my spine and made every breath a small act of labor.

"I know," Xu Ran said. "Tell me why."

His voice — the register that he used when he was pushing, the tone that lived halfway between clinical inquiry and genuine concern, the vocal instrument of a man who had learned that the right question at the right moment was more powerful than any answer. He was pushing because that was his function. That was what he was for.

I breathed.

The metallic taste was there — faint, persistent, the low metallic hum that had been background noise for weeks. My teeth vibrated with it. A frequency I couldn't identify and couldn't silence, like the resonance of a bell struck too long ago to hear but not long enough ago to forget.

"I am mortal," I said.

The words came out. Left my mouth. Entered the air. Occupied the space between us — the meter of mountain atmosphere that separated the woman who had created immortality from the man who was writing it down. The words were correct. The syntax was accurate. The statement was — 

Nothing.

My body: nothing.

The words hit the interior landscape the way rain hits stone — surface contact, immediate runoff, zero penetration. I am mortal. The sentence was a string of sounds that my mouth could produce and my ears could hear and my mind could comprehend, but it reached the place where words became conviction and it STOPPED. Not rejected — not the dramatic, forceful rejection of the wall. Just — stopped. The way water stops at a cliff's edge. The way light stops at an opaque surface. Naturally. Completely. Without drama.

Every fiber. Every cell. Every particle of qi that constituted the architecture of whatever I was — all of it knew. Knew with a certainty so deep it had become structural, had become the foundation upon which everything else was built. I am immortal. Not believed. Not thought. KNOWN. The way the body knows gravity, the way bone knows weight, the way the lungs know air. Below belief. Below thought. In the substrate.

I said "I am mortal" and my body heard "I am a fish" and gave the statement exactly the same amount of credence.

Xu Ran was watching. The brush hadn't moved — he'd been waiting to write something, and there was nothing to write, because nothing had happened.

"What did you feel?" he asked.

"Nothing."

"Nothing as in emptiness?"

"Nothing as in nothing happened. The words went in and came out the other side. My body doesn't believe them."

He considered. The considering was his face doing its thing — the micro-adjustments, the calibrations, the visible processing of a mind that treated information the way a forge treated metal. He wrote something. Short. Probably: Attempt 1. Result: none.

"Again," he said.

"It won't —"

"Again."

I looked at the clouds. They had moved since I'd last looked — not far, not meaningfully, but moved. The clouds didn't care about my attempts at mortality. The clouds were clouds. They formed, they drifted, they dissolved. Without conviction. Without effort. Without the desperate labor of a woman trying to convince her own bones that she was something she wasn't.

"I am mortal," I said again.

Nothing.

The fox-spirit was lying nearby, amber eyes open, watching me with the evaluative patience of an animal that had seen many things and was adding this to the catalog. It yawned. The yawn of a creature completely uninterested in the spiritual mechanics of an immortal's identity crisis.

Xu Ran wrote.

I sat.

The clouds moved.
