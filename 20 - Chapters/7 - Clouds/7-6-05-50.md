She stands up. Brushes the dust from her trousers. Goes inside. Makes tea.

The tea is bad. The water is too hot or too cold or somewhere in the middle that produces tea that is technically tea but fails to achieve the qualities that distinguish tea from hot-water-with-regret. She drinks it anyway. Standing at the window. Looking at the garden.

The plum tree is still there. The petals are still falling — intermittently, the natural shedding that the season produces, each petal departing the branch on its own schedule based on its own attachment strength and the wind's own arguments.

What has changed:

The conviction. "I am immortal." The statement that has lived in her — not as thought, not as belief, not as the conscious position that the mind maintains through effort — as FACT. The foundational, structural, architectural fact around which everything else was built. The load-bearing wall. The geological bedrock.

It has shifted.

A shift. A rotation. The thing that was "impossible to loosen" is now "difficult to loosen." The difference is a degree. The degree is everything.

She sets the tea down. The cup is ceramic, chipped at the rim, the material evidence of a vessel that has been used and survived and bears the marks. The tea cools.

The world continues. The afternoon holds its own sounds — a child counting somewhere down the lane, the creak of a cart, the wind in the trees. The garden grows. The sky holds its clouds. The specifically, pointedly QUIET confirmation that the largest moment of the series happens in a whisper.

She washes the cup. The domestic gesture that follows the transcendent — the earthly act of cleaning a vessel after using it, the grounding procedure that places the cosmic in the context of the kitchen.

Outside, the village continues. A child's voice — counting. The repetitive enumeration of a young mind engaged in the fundamental act of quantifying the world: "Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen."

She looks through the window. A child — six, maybe seven — stands in the lane between the houses. Small. Brown hair. The physical configuration of a child: limbs too long for the torso, coordination approximate, the body still negotiating its own proportions.

The child is counting stones.

Not collecting — counting. Each stone receives a number. Each number receives a touch — the index finger pressing each stone with the deliberate contact that counting requires. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. The stones are not remarkable. They are the ordinary stones of a village lane — grey, flat, the geological residue of a landscape that produces stones the way it produces dirt and weeds and the general material infrastructure of existence.

The child looks up. Sees the woman in the window. The child's face is — unreadable. Not hostile, not friendly, the neutral assessment that children perform when encountering adults they have not yet categorized.

"How many stones in your garden?" the child asks.

The question is absurd and exact and perfectly logical in the framework of a mind that counts everything.

"I don't know," she says.

The child appears to consider this a personal failing. The expression — a small frown, a slight narrowing of eyes — communicates the disapproval of someone who has encountered the uncounted and finds it unacceptable.

The child returns to counting. Seventeen. Eighteen.

She watches from the window. The counting continues down the lane, the child moving from stone to stone with the methodical progression of someone performing important work, the seriousness that children bring to self-assigned tasks.

She turns from the window. The house is small and clean and quiet. The tea is cold. The fear is there, in the corner, quieter than yesterday, present but no longer pushing its presence. Like a guest who has been acknowledged and has stopped demanding attention.

She sits at the table. The wood smells of cedar. Or oak.

The conviction has shifted. Not broken. Shifted. The difference between a locked door and a door slightly ajar — the same door, the same frame, the same hinges. But the light coming through is different. The air coming through is different.

She breathes. The breath goes all the way in. The breath comes all the way out. Unobstructed.

The afternoon passes. The shadows lengthen. The child's voice fades down the lane, counting things that do not need counting but are counted anyway because the counting is the point.

She makes more tea. It is still bad.

But it is hers.
