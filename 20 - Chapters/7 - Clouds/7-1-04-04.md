The cave came back.

Not as a single image but as a suite. Fragments that were too clear to be fragments, pieces that fitted together without instruction, the memory assembling itself from the sediment with the patient precision of an organism rebuilding from scattered cells.

Stone. Always stone. The walls were rough; I could feel them, feel the texture of unworked granite under small fingertips, the cold that was not seasonal but permanent, the kind of cold that lived in the rock itself and radiated outward in an endless, uninterested exhalation. This was not a cave someone had carved or chosen or prepared. This was a gap in the mountain that happened to be large enough for a very small person.

Darkness. Not complete. A greyness seeped in from somewhere, the reluctant light that penetrated the cave mouth and diffused through the first turn of the passage. Enough to see shapes. Not enough to see details. The world at the beginning had been grey and cold and close.

Water dripped.

The sound — I had described it to Xu Ran as the cave's heartbeat, and the description had been accidentally precise. The drip was regular, rhythmic, the water falling from a crack in the ceiling at intervals that could have been timed with a metronome. Each drip was a second, or a year, or an eon. At the beginning, time had no markers. The drip was the only clock. The drip was the only proof that the world was still operating.

"There was hunger," I said.

Xu Ran looked up from his notebook. We were sitting where we'd been sitting: the mountain camp, the afternoon light slanting through thinning clouds, the ordinary present containing the extraordinary past.

"Real hunger?"

"The body kind. The stomach-kind. I was — she was — eating what the cave offered. Moss. Insects. Water from the drip. Whatever could sustain a body that didn't know yet that it didn't need sustaining."

He wrote. "She didn't know."

"Not yet. The conviction, the immortality, it wasn't conscious. Not decided. It was — forming. Like the stone herself. Layer by layer. Each day of surviving in the cave was another layer. Each day of not dying was another confirmation that she would not die. The cave WAS the crucible. The birthplace not of the body but of the conviction."

The memory provided: cold nights. Not one cold night but an infinite sequence of cold nights, the same night repeated with variations so minor they didn't register as change. The small body curled on stone, the fetal arrangement of a child conserving warmth against a surface that had none to offer. The sound of breathing, her breathing, only her breathing, the singular respiratory track of the only person in the cave, in the world, in the grey beginnings of time.

"Was there anyone?" Xu Ran asked.

"No."

"Ever?"

I searched. The memory was clear but finite; it showed what it showed and withheld the rest, the way a room illuminated by a single candle shows you the nearest walls and nothing beyond.

"Not that I can find. The memory, it's like looking into water. Clear at the surface. Darker as it goes down. She was alone. Whether there was someone before the cave, before the memory begins, I don't know."

"Before the memory."

"There might be nothing before the memory. The cave might be the first thing. The origin. No parents, no — " I stopped. The thought was larger than I expected, the way a cave is larger from inside than it appears from outside. "No origin story. Just: existence. In a cave. Alone."

Xu Ran's brush had stopped again. He was looking at me with the expression he wore when the data exceeded his frameworks: the slight parting of lips, the widened eyes, the disorientation of a mind encountering something it had no category for.

"No origin," he repeated.

"Maybe. I don't know. The memory doesn't go further back. It starts in the cave and everything before the cave is nothing. Not erased nothing. Not hidden nothing. Nothing nothing."

He wrote. The writing was slower now, each character deliberate, the brush pressing into the paper with the weight of a man who understood that he was recording something that had no precedent.

The memory settled again. The sediment returning to the bottom. But the image remained, accessible, clear: the cave. The cold. The alone-ness. The drip of water measuring time that had no other measurement and a small body curled on stone, surviving, surviving, each survival a layer, each layer a brick in a conviction being built without a builder.

I had made myself immortal without knowing I was doing it.

The cave had been the kiln. The solitude had been the fuel. And the conviction — I will not die — had formed the way ash forms in a fire: not as intention, not as decision, but as the inevitable byproduct of a process that was happening beneath consciousness.

"She didn't choose it," Xu Ran said. Third person again, to the notebook. "The immortality wasn't a choice. It was a — sedimentation. Layer upon layer of surviving until surviving became the only possibility."

"Yes."

He looked at the sky. The clouds, thicker now, accumulating, the afternoon shifting toward the grey weight of potential rain.

"Then how do you un-choose something you never chose?"

The question sat between us like a stone in a field. Neither of us moved it. Neither of us could.

You wrote it down. A child in a cave, alone, dripping water. You gave my beginning a record. Before you, no one had written down a single thing I was. Sometimes the record matters more than the event.

The fox-spirit yawned. From its safe distance, it watched us with the amber patience of an animal that had no stakes in philosophical paradoxes but was willing to wait while the humans sorted themselves out.
