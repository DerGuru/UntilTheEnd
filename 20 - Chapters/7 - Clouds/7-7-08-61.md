Her hair is white.

Not grey — white. The complete absence of pigment that characterizes the terminal stage of the melanin cycle, the color that hair achieves when every follicle has stopped producing the chemical that provided color and has settled for the default. White the way paper is white. White the way snow is white. White the way clouds are white.

She looks at herself in the basin. The face that looks back has — changed. Not beyond recognition. The geometry is the same — the bone structure, the proportions, the architectural arrangement that constitutes her facial identity. But the surface has changed. Lines. Not seven anymore. The wrinkles have multiplied with the quiet efficiency of a process that, once started, does not require encouragement.

Her hands. She raises them. They tremble.

Slightly. Not the dramatic tremor of illness or advanced debility — the fine tremor, the micro-instability that aging produces in the connection between nerve and muscle, the signal degradation that time introduces. The hands that could reshape reality — could still, perhaps, in some attenuated form — now shake when they hold a teacup.

She holds the teacup. It shakes. The tea — still bad, still the thermal mediocrity that constitutes her relationship with the beverage — trembles in the cup.

A voice. From the fence.

"You got OLD."

The Counter. Not six anymore. Not seven. The child has grown — the irreversible process of biological development that transforms small people into less-small people, the years accumulating in height and limb-length and the loss of facial roundness that childhood cedes to adolescence. Ten, perhaps. Eleven. The face is longer. The voice is lower. The counting continues.

"Yes," she says. "Finally."

"Your wrinkles," the Counter says. She is studying the face with the analytical attention that has characterized her since the beginning, the numerical assessment that treats all countable things as equally worthy of enumeration.

"How many?"

"Too many to count."

The sentence — from the Counter, from the girl who counts EVERYTHING, from the child who has never met a number she couldn't assign to a thing — is the highest compliment. Too many. Beyond the jurisdiction of enumeration. Past the threshold of countability.

She smiles. The smile adds another wrinkle, probably.

"Come in," she says. "I'm cooking."

The Counter comes in. Sits at the table. Counts the chairs (two), the windows (one), the candles (three, two unlit). The counting is automatic, the low-level numerical narration that accompanies the Counter's existence the way breathing accompanies everyone else's.

She cooks.

The rice is GOOD.

The unmistakable, clearly-good quality of rice that has been prepared by someone who knows what they are doing. The water ratio is correct. The heat is calibrated. The timing is — she learned the timing. Through burnt pots and mediocre meals and the educational curriculum of failure, she learned the timing. The rice is fluffy. Separate grains. The particular textural evidence of rice cooked by hands that understand rice.

She serves. Two bowls. The equality of shared meals that Xu Ran performed and that she now performs — the democratic distribution, the identical portions, the giving and receiving that constitute the smallest unit of community.

The Counter eats with the efficient hunger of a growing child — quickly, thoroughly, with the biological urgency that developing bodies apply to caloric intake.

A knock. The door.

The neighbor. The short, wide woman who has been appearing since the first night. She stands in the doorway and her nose does what noses do — it follows the scent. The scent of good rice.

"You're cooking?"

"Yes."

"For me?"

"If you sit down."

The neighbor sits. Three at the table. Three bowls. The rice is good. The role reversal that has occurred without announcement — the woman who received rice on her first night is now providing rice, the recipient becoming the source, the fed becoming the feeder.

The neighbor eats. She pauses. She looks at the rice. She looks at the woman who cooked the rice. The evaluative gaze that the neighbor applies to everything.

"When did you learn to cook?" the neighbor asks.

She considers the question. The answer is — she doesn't have a date. Doesn't have a moment. The learning was not a moment but a process, the gradual accumulation that converted failure into competence through the patient compounding of small improvements.

"When I stopped trying to force it," she says.

The sentence contains everything. Not just cooking. Not just rice. The sentence contains the wall and the conviction and the surrender and the dissolving and the letting-go and the entire journey from a woman who fought everything to a woman who learned to stop fighting and discovered that the stopping produced results that the fighting never could.

The neighbor nods. The Counter nods. Neither of them hears the larger sentence. Both hear the smaller one. Both eat the rice. The rice is good.

She sits with white hair and trembling hands and too-many-to-count wrinkles and serves rice that is good to two people who eat it and the moment is — this one, she thinks.

This one.
