Day three. Day four. Day five.

The attempts became aggressive. The escalation that failure produced when failure was met with determination rather than acceptance — the ratcheting of force, the intensification of will, the woman sitting in the clearing each morning with the increasing conviction that volume would solve what finesse hadn't.

I AM MORTAL.

Like a mantra. Like a hammer striking stone. Like the repetitive impact that demolition required — the percussive insistence that walls responded to, the brute-force approach that worked on stone and steel and every material except the one I was trying to breach.

The echo disappeared.

Not gradually — the way the previous day's echo had faded, the acoustic trail thinning to silence. Suddenly. The wall grew THICKER under pressure, the defensive response of a structure that interpreted force as threat and threat as reason to reinforce. The more I pushed, the more the wall pushed back. The more I demanded, the more the wall denied. The systemic irony of a defense mechanism doing exactly what defense mechanisms did: defending.

Day five. I opened my eyes. The clearing was the same. The stream ran. The birds sang. The wall was stronger than it had been on day one.

Xu Ran was watching.

"You're fighting again," he said.

The sentence was quiet. The absence of emphasis that characterized his most important observations — the tonal flatness that indicated he was saying something that mattered and was trusting the words to carry their own weight.

"What else should I do?"

"This isn't a fight."

"What is it then?"

He set down his brush. The physical action that preceded his most considered responses — the tool put aside, the hands free, the body signaling that the next sentence required all available resources.

"A surrender."

The word was wrong. The word was offensive. The word was the lexical choice that a man who had never spent millennia surviving could make without understanding what it cost — the casual deployment of a concept that was, for someone who had SURVIVED as primary identity, the equivalent of —

"I don't surrender," I said.

"Exactly." He looked at me. "THAT. Is the problem."

Four words. Each one weighted. The deliberate pacing that placed emphasis on every syllable, the staccato delivery that made each word a separate statement housed in a single sentence.

He stood. He walked to the fire. He started cooking.

He LEFT me there. Sitting. In the clearing. With the sentence hanging in the air like a challenge and his back turned and the rice beginning to cook and the studied indifference of a man who had said what he had to say and was now declining to participate in the argument that would follow.

I sat.

The wall was there. Thicker than before. My own creation. My own architect. My own — trap. The defense mechanism that a child had constructed in a cave millennia ago, the unconscious decision of a small terrified being that death was unacceptable and that unacceptability could be made permanent if you believed it hard enough.

I had believed it hard enough.

And now I was trying to un-believe it with force, which was the same tool I'd used to believe it in the first place, which meant I was using the problem to solve the problem, which meant —

Surrender.

The word sat in my mind like a stone in a stream — immovable, present, the water of my thoughts parting around it and rejoining on the other side. Surrender wasn't how I worked. Surrender wasn't what I DID. I held. I persisted. I endured. I survived. Every verb in my vocabulary was a verb of retention — keeping, maintaining, holding, the linguistic inventory of a being whose entire existence was a continuous act of not-letting-go.

Letting go was surrender. Surrender was failure. Failure was death.

And death was the goal.

The recursion was perfect. The circular logic of a problem that contained its own solution AND its own prevention in a single configuration. I needed to let go to become mortal. I couldn't let go because letting go felt like dying. Dying was the point. But the part of me that had spent millennia ensuring I DIDN'T die couldn't distinguish between dying-as-goal and dying-as-threat.

Xu Ran was stirring the rice. His back was still turned. The communicative refusal of a man who understood that continuing the conversation was enabling the resistance, that every word he added was a tool I would use to maintain the fight, and the fight was the thing preventing the surrender.

He cooked. I sat.

The wall remained.

He wasn't wrong. The problem was exactly what he'd said it was. I couldn't surrender because I didn't surrender. I didn't surrender because surrendering meant losing. Losing meant dying. And dying was — at once — the one thing I'd spent millennia preventing and the one thing I now needed to achieve.

I needed to UNLEARN survival.

The impossibility of that sentence was comprehensive. Survival was learned once and permanently. The body learned it before the mind could object. The cells learned it before the body could intervene. The self learned it before the cells could explain. And once learned — once INSTALLED in the firmware of being — it couldn't be uninstalled through the normal channels of intention and effort.

The rice was cooking. The smell was familiar. Xu Ran's back was a statement.

I closed my eyes again. To sit. To be in the presence of the wall as a companion rather than an enemy, accepting its thickness, accepting its years, accepting its reasons. Just — to be there. With it. The way you sat with something you couldn't change.

The wall was still there when I opened my eyes.

But I was still there too.

And the difference between sitting with a wall and fighting a wall was — something. Something I didn't have a name for yet. Something that felt, despite everything, like progress.
