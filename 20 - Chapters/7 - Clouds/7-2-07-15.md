After the training, Xu Ran sat.

This was different from normal sitting. This was processing-sitting, the postural arrangement of a man whose mind was working through material that exceeded his frameworks and needed the body to be still while the recalibration occurred. He sat against a boulder, legs stretched, hands resting, face set in the blankness that indicated maximum internal activity.

He had seen a plant bloom in seconds. He had seen water rise against gravity. He had seen leaves float without wind. In minutes. As casual exercises, the warm-up stretches of a power that treated physics as a suggestion.

"You shape the world like clay," he said.

"No." The correction was important — the distinction that lived at the center of everything. "The world WAS always clay. I just didn't know I was the one with hands."

He looked at me. The processing-face shifted into the consideration-face — subtly different, the same way a knife's edge and a scalpel's edge are subtly different. Both sharp. Different purposes.

"If the world was always clay," he said. "And you didn't know you had hands. What have your hands been doing?"

"Unconsciously shaping."

"Everything?"

"Everything within range."

"What's the range?"

I didn't know. Didn't want to know. The question's implications were too large for a mountainside conversation, too vast for a Tuesday afternoon in spring. If the world was clay and my hands had been working for millennia and I hadn't known — then every tree, every river, every weather pattern, every geological feature within some unknowable radius might have been — adjusted. Not created. Adjusted. Shaped by the passive pressure of an unconscious conviction so massive it bent reality by existing.

He tried.

Of course he tried. The scholar's imperative — the need to test, to verify, to subject every phenomenon to the acid of empirical inquiry. He turned to a stone near his feet. Small, grey, ordinary. He stared at it with the concentrated intensity of a man applying every cognitive resource to a single, exact outcome.

Nothing.

He concentrated harder. His jaw tightened. His hands clenched on his knees. The stone — roundish, palm-sized, grey — remained exactly where it was, doing exactly what stones did, which was: nothing.

He leaned back.

"Seems to be a one-to-one thing," he said.

The observation was analytical. Not the "unfair" of the twist — not the emotional response to inequity but the clinical filing of a data point. His mind was doing what his mind did: categorizing, sorting, fitting the phenomenon into a framework that could hold it. One-to-one. Her. Only her. The capacity to shape reality through conviction was not a universal faculty that anyone could develop. It was deliberate. Singular. The result of a set of conditions — the cave, the solitude, the eons of accumulation — that no one else had experienced because no one else had lived long enough to accumulate.

"The implication," he said. Slowly. Choosing words the way a surgeon chose instruments. "If you are the only one. And the world is clay. And your hands have been working for thousands of years —"

"I know."

"— then nothing we see is untouched."

"I know."

"Every sunrise. Every rainfall. The growth patterns of forests, the courses of rivers, the—"

"I KNOW."

The sharpness surprised me. My voice — louder than intended, edged in a way that the calm of training hadn't produced. Because the implication was too large and too true and saying it out loud made it real in a way that knowing it privately didn't.

He stopped. Looked at me. His expression recalibrated — from scholar to companion, from observer to person. The recalibration was visible: a softening around the eyes, a loosening of the jaw, the physical signals of a man who recognized he had pushed past the productive boundary.

"Sorry," he said.

"Don't be."

"The clay metaphor."

"It's accurate."

"Accurate things can still be too much."

We sat. The clearing. The plant, still in bloom, its petals open, its scent drifting. The bowl of water, still, reflecting. The candle, unlit, waiting. The training equipment of an immortal learning to use her own power, arranged on a mountainside by a mortal who believed that arrangement was a form of love.

"What does it feel like?" he asked. Quieter now. "When you — shape?"

"Like remembering. Like knowing something you already knew. The leaf floats — and you remember that leaves float. The water rises — and you remember that water rises. It's not creation. It's — correction. As if the world had been doing it wrong and you're reminding it."

"Reminding the world."

"Yes."

He wrote that down. The brush moved with the slow, careful strokes of a man recording something that frightened him and fascinated him in equal measure.

The fox-spirit emerged from behind the boulder where it had been hiding during the training — the tactical withdrawal of an animal that preferred not to be within range of reality warps — and trotted across the clearing to sit equidistant from both of us. The amber eyes moved from face to face. Whatever it assessed, it kept.

We sat with the implication. The world as clay. The hands that had been working for millennia. The shapes they had made — unknowable, uncountable, the invisible fingerprints of an unconscious god on every surface of a reality that thought it was creating itself.

The clouds moved overhead. Formed, dissolved, reformed. The only honest things in the sky.
