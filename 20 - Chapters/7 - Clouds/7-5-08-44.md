She steps out of the cave. Light.

The assault of brightness after prolonged darkness — the eyes contracting, the pupils narrowing, the visual system recalibrating from fire-and-shadow to day. She blinks. Three times. Four. The mountain clarifies itself through the blinking, the landscape assembling from overexposure into resolution.

Air. Fresh. Cold. The composition of high-altitude atmosphere — thin, clean, carrying the scent of stone and distance and the ozone-hint of recent rain. She breathes in. Deep. The chest expanding, the ribs separating, the diaphragm descending. A full breath. The kind of breath that bodies take when bodies need to feel themselves breathing.

She speaks.

Not to anyone. Not to the fox-spirit, which sits at the cave mouth cleaning its paws with the methodical attention that animals apply to grooming. Not to the mountain, which does not listen. Not to the birds, which have resumed their territorial declarations in the scrub below the cave. To the air. To the world. To no one and everything.

"I have lived. That was enough."

The words come out in the acoustic register of spoken-aloud — louder than thought, quieter than declaration, the volume of a person testing a sentence's weight in air rather than in mind. The voice is hers. The sentence is Wei's.

The words sound hollow.

She knows this. She hears the hollowness — the sonic quality that distinguishes performance from truth, that separates a thing said from a thing meant. The words are correct. The grammar is correct. The sentiment is — adjacent to correct. But the sentence is a costume rather than a skin, worn rather than grown, put on rather than developed.

She speaks Wei's truth about herself and the truth does not fit.

Not yet.

The "not yet" is the important part. Not the hollowness — hollow things can be filled. Not the performance — performances can become authentic through repetition. The "not yet" implies a "but eventually." The "not yet" is temporal rather than permanent. The "not yet" is a promise disguised as a limitation.

She has said it. Out loud. Into the mountain air that carries sounds up and disperses them into the acoustic infinity of open space. The words are out. They exist in the world now, in the way that spoken words exist — briefly, ephemerally, the vibrations dissipating into the atmosphere and becoming part of the background noise of a planet that absorbs everything without judgment.

The air is fresh. The cold is real. The rain-scent is recent.

She breathes in again. The breath is different from the first one — less deliberate, more automatic, the body settling into the pattern of breathing-because-alive rather than breathing-because-choosing-to. The autonomic system taking over from the conscious one.

Below the cave, the mountain descends. The trail — barely a trail, more a sequence of possible steps suggested by geology — winds down through scrub and rock toward the treeline. Below the treeline, forest. Below the forest — she looks. Squints against the light.

Distance. Below the forest, the flattening of terrain that indicates a valley. The green of agriculture — cultivated green, the distinct shade that human intervention produces, the organized green that wild green never achieves. Fields. Cultivation. The evidence of a human presence, of hands in soil, of the relationship between people and land that produces food.

The fox-spirit follows her gaze downward. Amber eyes tracking the same descent, reading the same landscape, arriving at the same conclusion through a different vocabulary.

She stands at the cave mouth with the hollow sentence still vibrating in her chest and the mountain still falling away beneath her and the evidence of human life visible in the valley below.

She has said it. The words are empty. They will fill.

Or they won't.

Both possibilities are acceptable. Both are — real. The acceptance that comes from exhaustion and honesty and the state of a woman who has tried everything she can try alone and knows that trying alone has reached its limit.

She takes a step. Down. Toward the treeline. Toward the valley. Toward the smoke.

The step is heavy. Not metaphorically — literally. Her legs carry weight that the qi once negated, the gravitational consequence of a body existing in a gravitational field without full supernatural compensation. She feels her weight. She feels the stone's response to her weight. She feels the mechanical interaction of mass and surface that is walking.

One step. Then another. The descent begins.

The air smells of rain. The light is grey. The clouds above the peak are — present. Present and beginning, just at the edges, to dissolve.
