He was closer than I'd calculated.

Wei and I were at the river. Training — or what passed for it when the river was half its usual depth, the current sluggish and brown, and the rocks along the bank dry-cracked and warm to the touch. I'd moved the water exercises here because the flow added instability, which added difficulty, which added competence. Walk on solid ground and your body learns balance. Walk on shifting ground and your body learns adaptation. The difference matters when the ground stops being reliable.

Wei was ankle-deep in the current, working through the third-step pattern. Inhale, step, exhale, step. His right foot was still sloppy — he overcompensated on the transition, loading weight before his qi had settled into the new position. I'd corrected it four times today. He'd fixed it each time and then reverted within thirty seconds, which was either stubbornness or muscle memory resisting reprogramming, and in Wei's case was probably both.

"Right foot."

"I know."

"Then fix it."

He adjusted. Better. Not good, but better. He made it three steps before the current caught his ankle and he sat down hard in the water, sending up a splash that reached the bank. He stood up. Shook water from his hair. Started over.

Then I felt it.

Not the background pulse — that had been constant for weeks, a low-grade pressure humming in the qi around us like a bass note played too quietly to identify but too persistent to ignore. This was different. Sharper. Closer. A presence with edges, with direction, with the density that meant a living cultivator rather than an environmental phenomenon.

Three hundred meters. Forest. East.

I turned my head. Slowly — nothing urgent, nothing alarmed, the motion of someone checking the weather rather than identifying a threat.

He stood at the tree line.

Xu Ran.

Seventeen, maybe eighteen. Thin in the way young cultivators get when they burn through calories faster than they can replace them — not starved but whittled, every unnecessary gram stripped away by a body channeling more qi than it was designed to hold. His hair was long, unwashed, tangled in the way that suggested he hadn't thought about it in weeks. His robes — once fine, probably — were torn at the sleeves and stained with something dark. Qi-saturated fabric. The threads themselves hummed faintly, holding residual energy like batteries that hadn't been fully discharged.

In his right hand: a spirit beast core. Fresh. Still pulsing with a faint blue light, the last heartbeat of whatever creature it had belonged to fading in irregular bursts. He held it the way a farmer holds an apple — useful, ordinary, already categorized as fuel rather than trophy.

His face.

I studied it. Concentrated. His face was not cruel — that was the thing the villagers wouldn't understand, and the thing I needed Wei to eventually learn. Xu Ran wasn't a villain. He wasn't hunting because he enjoyed suffering or because he'd been corrupted by power or because some dark force had twisted his nature. He was hunting because the breakthrough demanded resources, and spirit beast cores were resources, and the math was simple and the conclusion was obvious and morality had nothing to do with equations.

I'd worn that face. Millennia ago. Before I'd seen what the equations produced when you followed them long enough.

He looked in our direction. Through us. Two figures in a river — a woman and a boy, peasants, beneath his notice the way the river was beneath his notice: present, acknowledged, irrelevant. His eyes moved on. He turned. Walked back into the forest. The trees closed behind him and the pressure receded — not gone, just relocated.

The whole encounter lasted ten seconds.

Wei had stopped practicing. He stood in the water, dripping, staring at the place where the figure had been.

"Who was that?"

"Nobody you want to know."

"That wasn't nobody. I felt him. Like—" He pressed a fist against his chest. "Here. Like something heavy."

He'd felt the qi-pressure. Second-step sensitivity, working as intended. He couldn't identify the level or the nature or the intent — he was years from that kind of nuance — but he'd registered the weight of it, the physical reality of a cultivator operating at a tier so far above him that the gap wasn't a gap but a canyon.

"Was that him? The one causing the earthquakes?"

"Yes."

"He's young."

"Yes."

Wei looked at me. His face was doing the thing it did when he was incorporating new information that didn't fit his existing model — a slight narrowing of the eyes, a compression of the mouth, the visible architecture of a mind rebuilding itself around an unwelcome truth.

"You could stop him."

I didn't answer. The river murmured between us, filling the silence with the kind of noise that acts as punctuation rather than content.

"Couldn't you?"

"Right foot," I said. "Fix the transition."

He held my gaze for three full seconds. Then he turned, faced upstream, and resumed the pattern. Inhale. Step. Exhale. Step. His right foot was better this time.

He didn't ask again that afternoon.
