"Give me space."

Three words. Not shouted. Not asked. Delivered with a quality I hadn't used in — I couldn't remember. A quality that lived in the lower register of the voice, below diction and above vibration, where authority isn't projected but emitted, where the listener doesn't decide to obey but discovers that they already have.

They moved. All of them. Elder Li released Wei's head — gently, carefully, lowering it to the ground with one hand while pulling back with the other. His mother lifted her hands from Wei's face. She didn't step away — she couldn't, the physics of a mother and an unconscious child don't permit that kind of separation — but she made space. A meter. Enough.

I knelt.

His face was slack. Not peaceful — the word implies a state of mind, and there was no mind present. He was elsewhere — deep, dark, somewhere the body goes when the conscious faculties have been overloaded and the only function left is the mechanical continuation of breathing and heartbeat and the slow, grinding work of repair.

Under his skin, the light pulsed. Irregular, too fast, each pulse a small discharge of excess qi leaking through the channel walls and radiating outward through tissue that was adapting to the energy in real time. The channels were closed — the safety mechanism had worked, shutting intake before rupture — but they were still loaded. Full to capacity with qi they hadn't been designed to hold, straining at their walls, the pressure producing the glow the way any overcharged body produces waste heat.

I placed my hands on his chest.

"What are you doing?" His mother's voice. Close. Ragged.

"Helping." One word. It was all I could spare.

"Will he —"

"Quiet. Please."

She went quiet. The *please* did it. I hadn't used the word in centuries.

Both hands. Flat. Palms down. Over the place where the primary meridian originated, where the dantian would be if he were old enough and trained enough to have one, where the central hub of the qi-circulatory network gathered its energy before distributing it to the periphery.

I closed my eyes.

And I reached in.

Not physically. Not even in the way cultivators describe reaching — the metaphorical extension of qi-sense into another body, the diagnostic touch that healers use to map damage and identify blockages. What I did was simpler and more dangerous and more intimate than any of those approximations.

I felt his channels. Directly. Each one — the primary, the secondaries, the tertiary network that web his nerves. They were there, built by my instruction, shaped by his practice, strengthened by months of careful, gradual, conservative development. They were intact. Strained. Overcharged. But intact.

The pressure was distributed unevenly. The primary channel bore the most — the central pathway had absorbed the bulk of the qi-flood and hadn't had time to distribute the excess before shutdown. The secondaries were loaded but manageable. The tertiaries — the fine network — were hot, inflamed, the tissue around them irritated by energy levels they'd never been exposed to.

I started with the primary. Slowly. The principle was simple: release the overpressure by opening the channels incrementally, allowing the excess qi to flow outward in a controlled stream rather than a burst. The same physics as a pressure valve — too fast and the channel walls would rupture, too slow and the trapped energy would convert to heat and the heat would damage the tissue from the inside.

The calibration required precision I hadn't exercised in centuries. This wasn't the blunt force of stopping a shockwave or the cosmic indifference of dismissing a tribulation. This was surgery. The channels were small — impossibly small, the width of a hair, the walls thinner than paper. The energy inside them was large relative to the space, pressing outward with the insistence of a thing that wanted to expand and was being denied.

I opened the first channel by a fraction. Qi leaked out — a thin stream, controlled, directed. I guided it — not outward, not into the atmosphere, but downward, into the ground, through my own hands, through me. I absorbed it the way the river had absorbed the shockwave: completely, without resistance, without limit.

One minute. Two. The primary channel's pressure dropped. The glow along his sternum faded from blue-white to blue.

I moved to the secondaries. Both arms simultaneously — the paired channels running from heart to hands, the bilateral symmetry of a qi-network designed by evolution for balance. Slower here. The secondary channels were narrower, less robust, more vulnerable to the stress of overcharge. I opened them carefully, millimeter by millimeter, monitoring the wall integrity in real time.

Five minutes. The glow in his arms dimmed. His fingers — which had been luminous, the light visible through skin and nail — settled to a faint shimmer.

The tertiary network was the hardest. The fine channels — hundreds of them, thousands, a web that mapped every nerve and capillary with a precision that bordered on the cosmic. Each one was overcharged. Each one was unique — different width, different tolerance, different load. I couldn't treat them in bulk. I had to address each one individually, opening it, draining it, monitoring it, closing it, moving to the next.

Ten minutes. Twelve. Fifteen.

"His face," his mother whispered. "The light is fading. Is that —"

"Good," I said. "It's good."

She pressed both hands over her mouth. Held the sound in. Held everything in.

His breathing changed. The shallow, rapid pattern slowed. Deepened. The intervals stretched — one, two, three. One, two, three. The third-step pattern reasserting itself, the body's trained rhythm rising through the static of overload and finding its signal.

The glow faded. A faint luminescence remained, a residual charge that would take hours or days to fully dissipate. But the active radiation had stopped. The pressure had been relieved. The channels were open, clear, functional.

Different.

They were different. I could feel it — the walls were thicker than they'd been this morning. The capacity was larger. The qi-flood had done what controlled training would have done over months: it had stressed the channels to their limit and the channels had responded by restructuring — muscle building density under strain, bone adding mass under impact.

He was at the third step now. Maybe higher. Not through training, not through discipline, not through the careful, methodical progression I'd planned — through catastrophe. Through the uncontrolled intake of dispersed qi that I had put into the atmosphere to save a village.

My doing. My consequence. The action and its cost, linked by a chain of causation that started with a raised hand and ended with a twelve-year-old boy glowing on the ground.

His face relaxed. The vacancy softened into something more recognizable — not consciousness but sleep. Real sleep. The body's natural recovery state, the deep, restorative processing that repairs and integrates and prepares for waking. His features settled into the arrangement that twelve-year-old faces make when the day's demands have been removed and the architecture of childhood reasserts itself.

His breathing was even. Deep. The third-step pattern, steady and strong, as though it had never been interrupted.

I lifted my hands from his chest. Set them in my lap.

He would live. He would wake up — hours from now, maybe tomorrow, when the body had finished its reconstruction and the mind had processed whatever it had seen in the moment when everything opened and the world was made of light.

He would be different.

"He'll wake?" Elder Li. Standing behind the others, hands clasped, the posture of a man who had run out of practical contributions and was left with only the question.

"Tomorrow. Maybe sooner."

"And then?"

I didn't answer. *And then* was a door I hadn't opened yet. The hinges were rusted. The room behind it was dark.

I looked at my hands. Steady. Warm. They looked the way they always looked — ordinary, unremarkable, the hands of a woman who collected herbs and knew things about stones and lived at the edge of a forest.

Except everyone was watching.
