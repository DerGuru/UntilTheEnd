Dawn was two hours away.

The trench was done. The river was filling the widened channel with the quiet persistence of water following its nature. No urgency, no awareness. Just fluid seeking level. By dawn, the new section would be fully integrated into the flow. The absorption capacity would peak at midday, when the sun warmed the surface layer and the thermal differential increased the rate of qi-energy dissipation.

The village wasn't at the village.

They were on the southern slope, exactly where Wei had directed them. Fifty-four people — I counted automatically, my mind processing the headcount before my consciousness acknowledged the action — spread across the low ground behind the ridge that separated the valley from the river plain. Sleeping bundles. Extinguished cooking fires. The particular disorder of a temporary camp established by people who'd packed in haste, arrived in confusion and organized themselves with the slow, grudging competence of a community that couldn't afford to be incompetent.

The families were grouped by proximity to their original houses, the elderly positioned nearest the ridge (flattest ground, easiest access), the water containers centralized, the perimeter marked with stones in a pattern that was mine. Wei'd borrowed my barrier design — the logic of it, not the specifics — and applied it to people instead of qi-flows. Placement. Routing. The efficient distribution of limited resources across a variable terrain.

He was asleep.

I found him at the camp's edge, lying on the bare ground with his pack as a pillow and no blanket. He'd given his blanket to Mrs. Zhao, whose dislocated shoulder made lying down painful and who needed padding more than warmth. His face in the moonlight looked exhausted.

He was thin. Thinner than last week. The cheekbones prominent, the jaw defined, the softness erased by weeks of labor and rationing and the metabolism of a boy growing faster than his caloric intake could support. His breathing was the third-step pattern — even in sleep, even exhausted, even on bare ground with no blanket and a pack for a pillow. The pattern held. It had become part of his architecture.

His hands were visible. Curled against his chest. They were dirty and raw and the nails were broken and there was a blister on his left palm — unlike mine now — that looked infected.

Twelve years old.

The number recurred like a baseline note in a composition that didn't want you to forget the key signature. Twelve. Twelve. The age at which most children in stable environments were learning to read, or fish, or negotiate the social hierarchies of other twelve-year-olds. The age at which this twelve-year-old was leading an evacuation.

I knelt beside him. Somewhere behind me, a child turned over in their sleep and whimpered once, before going quiet again.

Wei had to learn to carry this himself.

The thought arrived with its usual clarity — sharp, clean, undeniable. I'd had it before. It had evolved from observation into something that felt like preparation.

He needed to learn to do this alone. Not because I planned to leave — that option had been removed from the table by congee and a mother's five words. But because the world was not a place where the presence of someone like me could be permanent. Nothing about me was permanent. I'd spent thousands of years proving that. Remaining was not the same as being present.

He needed to not need me. Eventually. Not now — now he was twelve, the ground was shaking, the sky was glowing and the village was sleeping on a hillside because a boy had told them to. But eventually. When the crisis passed. When the landscape stabilized. When the drought broke, when the well was clean again and the village returned to the ordinary, grinding process of existing.

He needed to stand up in a square and not look for me at the edge of the crowd. He needed to build barriers without being shown how. He needed to read terrain and count resources and make decisions larger than his experience. He needed to trust the gap between his capacity and his reach was a space he could grow into, not fall through.

He needed to not need me.

A thought that returned heavier each time… like a nail going in.

I looked at his hands. Small, broken, dirty. Holding nothing. The hands of a boy who would someday be a man, that would need to hold a world and would need to do it without a very old woman standing behind him with clenched fists and singing bones.

I stood up. Walked to the ridge. Looked east.

The qi-column had stabilized. No more pulsing — a steady, sustained glow, the final compression before ignition. Xu Ran was ready. The tribulation would come with dawn.

Dawn was in two hours.
