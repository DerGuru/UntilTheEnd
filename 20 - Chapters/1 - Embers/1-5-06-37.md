The hilltop. My hilltop.

I'd stopped pretending it wasn't mine somewhere around the second week. Ownership was an illusion I'd abandoned centuries ago — the idea that a person could claim a piece of earth, as though the earth acknowledged the transaction, as though the rock and the grass and the wind agreed to belong to someone simply because that someone stood there frequently enough to wear a path. But this hilltop had my shape in the grass. The flat stone where I sat had adapted to the angles of my weight. The view was arranged the way I preferred it: the valley below, the village to the south, the eastern ridge where Xu Ran's qi-signature pulsed with increasing urgency.

I came here to think. Or to not think. The difference was less clear than it used to be.

The wind was warm. Dry. It carried the smell of baked earth and dying grass and the faint, metallic tang of qi-contaminated air. The same wind that had blown across the valley every afternoon for decades, except now it carried a weight that had nothing to do with temperature or humidity and everything to do with the young man in the forest who was compressing the equivalent of a small sun into his dantian and didn't care what leaked.

Xu Ran's signature was stronger today. Not just stronger — structured. The chaotic pulsing of the past weeks had organized itself into something rhythmic, intentional, the unmistakable pattern of a cultivator entering the final phase of consolidation. He was close. Days, not weeks.

I watched the horizon. The light was strange above his position — a subtle distortion, like heat shimmer but wrong, the air itself bending around a density it couldn't accommodate. Invisible to normal eyes. To mine, it was a beacon.

Then the thought came.

Not mine.

*He wants to touch the sky. He believes he deserves it.*

I went still. Not the stillness of concentration or meditation or the careful immobility that four thousand years of discipline had made automatic. A different stillness. The stillness of something suddenly and fundamentally wrong.

The thought hadn't formed the way thoughts form — emerging from context, moving through association, arriving at consciousness with the fingerprints of their origin visible if you looked closely enough. This thought had appeared. Complete. Polished. Foreign.

The stone was cold under my palms. I hadn't noticed when I'd pressed them flat against it.

The words dissolved as quickly as they had arrived, leaving behind a thin, unsettling residue.

From the village below, a metal-on-stone clatter carried up the slope. Someone dropping a pot. A small human mistake.

I believed it the way I believed a wall with a door in it was still a wall.

My shadow twitched — a brief lateral slip on the grass — and then it was normal again.

I stood up. Walked down the hill. The shadow followed, obedient and synchronous and entirely normal.

I did not think about it further.

I didn't.
