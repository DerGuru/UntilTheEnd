The thunder came from the wrong direction.

Not from the sky — the sky was empty, cloudless, the same mocking blue it had maintained for twenty-two consecutive days. The thunder came from the forest. Four hundred meters east, maybe less. A deep, concussive sound that arrived in the chest before it arrived in the ears, the kind of noise that bypasses hearing entirely and communicates directly with the animal brain that has spent a few hundred thousand years learning to interpret large sounds as large threats.

Trees snapped. The sound was different from wind-break — sharper, more violent, the crack of wood being overwhelmed rather than bent. I could hear them falling in sequence, each one a second behind the last, toppling outward from a central point like dominos arranged by someone who didn't care about the arrangement.

Then the scream.

A spirit beast — large, cornered, dying. The sound was wrong in the way that dying sounds are always wrong: too loud, too sustained, too human. Spirit beasts vocalize differently from animals — their cry carries qi, and the qi carries an emotional signature that penetrates deeper than sound alone. This one carried terror. Not the simple terror of a prey animal caught by a predator, but the terror of a creature facing something so far above it that the concept of escape didn't apply.

The scream cut off.

Silence. The kind that follows violence, when the world pauses to take inventory of what's changed.

Then the qi-explosion.

I'd been expecting it — not this one specifically, but this kind. Xu Ran had been hunting in an expanding radius for days, each kill releasing a burst of qi as the spirit beast's core destabilized and discharged its stored energy. The previous ones had been distant enough that the village felt them as pressure changes — ears popping, headaches, children becoming irritable without knowing why.

This one was close.

The shockwave rolled out from the kill site like a stone dropped in still water.

It hit my barriers.

Stone took it. Split it. Forced it down the trench toward the river. What slipped past scattered against the granite ridge and broke into fragments that reached the village as a gust of warm wind and the brief, ugly feeling of standing up too fast.

The village felt it. Leaves that hadn't yet fallen tore free and spiraled. Ripples appeared in the water barrels. A fence — the same fence Wei had repaired three days ago — cracked at its weakest joint and leaned sideways. The old rooster on Mrs. Zhao's roof flapped and screamed and fell off the edge, landing with more dignity than the situation warranted.

Two roof tiles slid loose from Elder Li's house and shattered on the ground. A child started crying. Another child joined. Then a dog howled, and another dog answered, and for thirty seconds the village was a chorus of panic that had no source it could identify and no target it could negotiate with.

Then it passed. The wave dissipated. The warm wind died. The silence returned, cautiously, one sound at a time — a bird, a voice, a door opening.

Only then did my mind do what it always did: measure.

My barriers held.

Barely. The second stone wall had shifted — two stones fallen, the angle compromised. Another explosion at the same intensity, and the wall would redirect thirty percent instead of sixty.

That had been a hunting kill — chaotic, uncontrolled. Xu Ran's actual breakthrough would be worse. Focused. Sustained.

My barriers would not be enough.

The village would survive in the technical sense. But the well would sour. The harvest would fail. The winter would come, and the village would face the slow arithmetic of starvation: how many mouths, how much grain, how many weeks.

I was still calculating when Wei ran past me.

He heard the scream. He heard the fence crack. He heard a child cry his name from the square — thin, panicked — and his body made the decision before his mind caught up.

Toward the forest.

He was fast — faster than he'd been a month ago, the qi-steps giving him speed that surprised me even though I'd taught him the technique. He moved through the clearing at the village's edge without slowing, angling toward the tree line, toward the direction the explosion had come from, toward the precise location where a cultivator was doing exactly that.

I was in front of him before he reached the trees.

He didn't see me move. One moment I was behind him — thirty meters back, standing on the ridge where I'd been checking the barriers. The next moment I was here, between him and the forest, close enough that he had to stop or collide with me.

He stopped anyway.

His feet skidded in the dirt. His breath hitched. His eyes went wide — not with fear, not exactly. With the shock of his world briefly failing to behave.

No one else was close enough to see it cleanly. Dust. Bodies moving. People looking for children and fallen tiles and a rooster that had become a projectile. If anyone noticed a blur at the tree line, they would file it under panic and keep working.

"No."

"But there's—"

"*No.*"

He stopped. Not because the word was loud — it wasn't. It was quiet. Controlled. The opposite of shouting. But something in it — something I hadn't authorized and hadn't intended and couldn't recall putting there — made him stop the way a wall makes you stop. Not through force. Through absolute, immovable presence.

He looked at my face. I don't know what he saw. I know what I did: my hands curled once, hard, and then uncurled. My jaw locked. The cold in my chest had edges.

Fear. Not for me. For him.

"Go to the village," I said. "Help with the cleanup."

"Yun—"

"The fence needs fixing. Two roof tiles fell from Elder Li's house. Mrs. Zhao's rooster fell off the roof. He'll need catching."

"What about—"

"Go."

He went. He turned — slowly, reluctantly, with the visible effort of a boy overriding every instinct he had — and walked toward the village. He looked back once. I was standing where he'd left me, facing the forest, and I stayed there until he was far enough away that the distance was its own barrier.

Then I looked into the trees.

Four hundred meters. I could feel Xu Ran — his signature settling, consolidating.

Eight days. Maybe fewer.

I stood at the tree line for a long time. The forest smelled like ozone and broken wood and sharp wrongness, the kind that lingers after a creature dies from qi-discharge rather than physical trauma. The trees that still stood leaned away from the kill site, their branches pointing outward, repelled by a force that had already passed.

Then I walked back to the village. The fence needed fixing. The tiles needed replacing. The rooster needed catching.

And I needed to not think about what would happen when eight days became zero and the barriers weren't enough.

I had already decided what I would not do.
