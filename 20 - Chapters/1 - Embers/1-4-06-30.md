The sky burned at the edges.

Not fire — light. The kind of light that has no business existing at three in the morning, sharp and cold and rhythmic, pulsing against the horizon in intervals that were too regular to be natural and too bright to be ignored. Blue-white. The color of qi pushed past its containment threshold, discharging into the atmosphere because whatever was generating it couldn't hold any more.

The villagers felt it before they saw it.

Mrs. Zhao couldn't sleep — she told me later, or rather she told the tree line, assuming correctly that I was somewhere behind it. A pressure, she said. In her temples. Like a headache that wasn't quite a headache, like the feeling before a thunderstorm but without the clouds. The children cried in their sleep — not all of them, but enough. The dog didn't bark. That was worse. The dog had barked at everything for years; its silence was an event that the village's collective subconscious registered as a signal.

Elder Li stood outside his house. I could see him from the ridge — a thin silhouette against the darker dark of his doorway, arms at his sides, face turned toward the northwest where the lights pulsed. He said nothing. He watched with the patience of a man who had survived enough to know that watching was sometimes the only action available, and that the quality of your watching could matter even when its quantity could not.

Wei stood beside me.

He'd come out of the house soundlessly — his qi-steps working even on instinct now, feet finding the quiet ground without conscious effort. He was in sleeping clothes, which were just his regular clothes with more wrinkles. His eyes were on the horizon.

"That's the cultivator, isn't it."

It wasn't a question. The rising inflection that usually turned his statements into invitations had flattened, pressed down by the weight of what he was looking at.

I nodded. Once. Slowly.

"How long?"

I had been tracking Xu Ran's spiral for weeks. His pattern was clear — a tightening gyre, each pass consuming a wider band of ambient qi, each pass bringing him closer to the center of the valley where the convergence of ley lines produced the density he needed for the final push. He was approaching critical mass. The discharges — the lights on the horizon — were the overflow, the pattern venting excess because the container was approaching its limit.

"Three weeks. Perhaps four."

"And then?"

The lights pulsed. Three beats. Four. A pause. Then three more. The rhythm of a heart that was growing too large for its chest.

"Then it gets loud."

He was quiet for a long time. The lights reflected in his eyes — small, cold points that moved each time the pulse reset.

"The village," he said. "What happens to the village?"

I mapped it internally. Xu Ran's position: fifty li northwest now, closer than last week. The village's position: not at the epicenter, but within the radius. When a cultivator at Xu Ran's level attempted a breakthrough to Core Formation, the qi-shockwave would radiate outward in a sphere whose radius depended on the amount of energy released. At minimum: the crops would die. The water table would be disrupted. The ambient qi that sustained the ecosystem — the plants, the animals, the invisible infrastructure of living energy that kept a valley alive — would be scattered, requiring years to resettle.

At maximum: the ground would crack. The houses — those fragile arrangements of wood and thatch and hope — would shake apart. The well would go dry. The people wouldn't die, probably. But their world would.

"The harvest," I said. "The water. The forest."

"But not the people?"

"Probably not."

"Probably."

The word hung between us. *Probably* was a word that sounded definite until you leaned on it.

"Can you—" He stopped. Swallowed. Started again. "You said — or you didn't say, but I know — you could stop this. One thought. One finger. The same way you stopped the boar."

I said nothing. The lights pulsed.

"Why don't you?"

The honest answer was longer than this boy's patience. Every time I'd intervened at my level, the consequences had been worse than the problem. The last time I'd stopped someone's ascension, the crater took four hundred years to fill with water. People built temples on the lakeshore. None of them knew they were praying on a grave.

"It's complicated," I said.

He looked at me. Really looked — with the directness that was his inheritance, the refusal to accept a vague answer when a specific one existed and was being hidden behind language designed to obscure.

"Okay," he said.

He didn't push. Didn't demand. He stood beside me in the dark, twelve years old, watching the sky burn with a light that shouldn't exist, and accepted *complicated* the way he accepted everything I offered — with the quiet trust of someone who believed that the whole answer would come eventually, and that waiting for it was part of the curriculum.

The lights pulsed until dawn. By morning, they were gone — absorbed back into the distance, invisible under sunlight. But the pressure remained, a constant low-grade hum at the edge of perception, and the dog did not bark, and the children were quiet, and the village went about its business with the careful, deliberate movements of people walking on ice they couldn't see.

Three weeks. Perhaps four.

The clock had always been ticking. Now, everyone could hear it.
