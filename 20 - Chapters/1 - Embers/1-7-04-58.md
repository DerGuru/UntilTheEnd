Xu Ran's core sealed.

What had begun days ago — the compression, the tribulation, the initial release that had tested my trench and my margins — reached its conclusion with the elegance of something done correctly by someone talented enough to deserve the result. The remaining spiral collapsed inward. The last layers folded. The qi compressed into a single point of density that flickered, held, and then solidified with a pulse that I felt in the marrow of every bone in my body.

The breakthrough had settled. The core was whole.

The boy had done it. The young man who'd been hunting spirit beasts and draining the valley and sitting in a cave compressing power with the single-minded dedication of someone who saw nothing beyond his own ascension — he'd ascended. His new core burned in his chest like a small sun, stable, brilliant, radiating the kind of power that would make him a significant figure in whatever sect or faction or territory he chose to enter.

Good for him.

The shockwave built in the fraction of a second between the core's final seal and expulsion. The structure locked — and everything it couldn't contain was pushed outward. Not gradually. Not incrementally. All of it. At once. A sphere of pure qi-energy expanding from Xu Ran's position at a speed that made sound look leisurely, carrying the accumulated waste of weeks of consolidation and the specific violence of a structure rearranging itself at a fundamental level.

The shockwave hit the trees. The remaining skeletons — the bare, stripped trunks that had survived the preparation phase — snapped. Not at the base. At every point simultaneously. They didn't fall — they FRAGMENTED. Splinters. Dust. The cellular structure overloaded and the wood converted from solid to particulate in the time between one heartbeat and the next.

The shockwave hit the ground. The glazed surface cracked — deep, branching fractures radiating outward from the epicenter like the pattern on a shattered mirror. The earth itself groaned — a subsonic protest, the voice of geology being pushed beyond its engineering specifications.

The shockwave hit the river.

My river. My trench. My thirty meters of clay and stone and blisters and blood.

The water caught it. The channel — widened, deepened, reinforced — received the leading edge of the shockwave and did what water does with energy: absorbed it. The surface erupted. Steam. The water didn't boil — it DETONATED. The qi-energy was too concentrated for gradual absorption; the water molecules absorbed it instantly, exceeded their thermal capacity, and converted to vapor with a violence that threw a wall of steam a hundred meters into the air.

The stones held. The stacked granite — each piece chosen for density, each angle calculated for deflection — caught the excess energy and redirected it. Some of it. The front row burst. Three stones fractured, the granite unable to absorb the qi-load, splitting along crystal planes with sharp, percussive cracks. But the second row held. The third row held. The angles I'd calculated deflected the redirected energy into the downstream pool, where the volume absorbed it with a surge that raised the water level by a meter and sent waves crashing against the banks.

The trench held.

One third of the shockwave. Absorbed. Dispersed. Gone.

But two thirds remained. The portion that the water and the stones couldn't catch — the majority, the overwhelming majority — rolled onward. South. Toward the village. Toward the southern slope. Toward the twenty-three people and the twelve-year-old boy who were three li away and directly in the path of a force that would crack foundations and collapse roofs and shatter the stored grain and ruin the root vegetables that Mrs. Liu had planted with her practical, indomitable hands.

Two thirds.

I felt the wave passing me. Around me. Through me — it moved through my body the way wind moves through a window, present and impotent and barely noticed. The qi-energy at this concentration was a catastrophe for everything in its path except me. For me, it was weather.

I watched the wave roll south. Three li. Five seconds. My barriers — the stone walls on the eastern ridge — would catch some. The redirected qi-channels would absorb some. But even combined, the reduction would bring the wave down to perhaps forty percent of its original force.

Forty percent of that, hitting an unprotected village.

Not lethal. Probably. The evacuation had moved everyone to the southern slope, behind the ridge. The ridge itself would block part of the pressure. The buildings would take the damage instead of the people.

But. The buildings were homes, and the homes held stores, and the stores held the grain and the dried fish and the filtered water that stood between the village and starvation, and starvation was slower than a shockwave but just as final.

Forty percent.

Two seconds. The wave was past me. Moving through the dead zone, crossing the fused ground, entering the valley where the living trees had been and the living things had fled.

Two seconds until the barriers. Three until the village. Five until the southern slope.

I watched it go.

Not enough.

The words arrived with the simplicity of arithmetic. Not enough. The trench, the barriers, the redirections — all of it, everything I'd built with human hands and human effort and the deliberate, principled refusal to use what I was — not enough.

The wave rolled south. The valley trembled in advance of its arrival.

One second.

Not enough.
