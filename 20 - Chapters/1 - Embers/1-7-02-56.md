The forest was dying.

Not the slow, drought-induced decline of the past weeks — the gradual decay, the dead branches, the incremental retreat of life from the valley's periphery. This was immediate. The trees closest to Xu Ran's position were stripped — bark peeled away by qi-pressure, the exposed wood underneath bleached white, the grain visible like bone beneath skin. Further out, the trees were still standing but emptied, even their twigs gone, their branches bare, each one a skeleton of its former architecture pointing at the sky with the accusatory posture of things that had been alive an hour ago.

The river was ahead. My river. My trench. The hundred and twenty meters of clay and stone that I'd dug in the dark — half by hand, half by something I was still pretending was just efficiency — widened and reinforced and aligned with the physics of qi-absorption with the precision of someone who'd been studying those physics since before the trees I was walking through had been seeds.

The trench was still intact. The stones held. The water flowed — barely, but flowing. The qi-flow I'd redirected was still channeling through the widened section, the water absorbing residual energy with the patient efficiency of a channel doing what it was designed to do.

I knelt at the riverbank. Checked the stones. 

The ground was fractured. Deep, structural fissures running through the forest floor like the crazing on old pottery. Qi leaked from the cracks in visible wisps — pale, faintly luminescent, the excess energy that Xu Ran's consolidation was producing faster than the earth could absorb. The wisps rose and dissipated, each one a tiny surrender, a small amount of energy returning to the atmosphere because the ground had run out of places to put it.

I walked through this. Toward the center.

The air was thick enough to taste. Metallic, electric, with an undertone of something organic — the smell of qi at concentrations that dissolved chemical bonds and released molecular gases from structures that had been stable for centuries. Ozone. Iron. The faint, sweet decay of cellulose breaking down at an accelerated rate.

Normal humans would be dead by now. The qi-density at this distance — two hundred meters from the epicenter — was sufficient to disrupt everything living. The body would fail under it's interference. Death would feel like falling asleep: a gradual dimming, a loss of coordination, a slide into unconsciousness followed by cardiac arrest. Quick. Painless, probably. Not a bad way to go, if you had to.

The pressure spiked.

For half a second the air tightened, the way a deep place tightens when you dive too fast. My skin prickled. The river ahead slapped once against its own bank, a sharp, involuntary sound.

Then it eased. Not gone. Never gone. Just reduced back to its steady, murderous weight.

I kept walking.

One hundred meters. The trees were gone — not fallen but disintegrated, their molecular structure unable to withstand the qi-saturation. Where ancient oaks had stood, there were circles of grey dust on the forest floor. Centuries of growth, reduced to powder. The ground beneath was smooth, glassy — the clay fused by qi-pressure into something that resembled ceramic, dark and reflective and warm under my feet.

Behind me. Above me. Around me.

Xu Ran's presence.

He was close — fifty meters. I could feel his qi-spiral with the same granularity I felt the stone under my fingers. Tight. Dense. Layered. The final configuration — everything packed, everything compressed, the structure complete and the containment holding and the threshold approaching with the mathematical inevitability of a countdown that had started weeks ago and was now in its final digits.

The tribulation.

It would begin soon. Minutes. Seconds maybe. The qi-column was pulsing — a pale gold pillar rising from the dead forest like something sacred. It was beautiful. The light caught the dust of disintegrated trees and turned it into a shimmering curtain, warm and soft, the kind of radiance that painters spend lifetimes trying to capture. Beautiful, and surrounded by a hundred meters of ash that had been forest this morning.

I took a deep breath and nodded once, the physical punctuation that marked the end of one task and the beginning of the next.

The next task was waiting.

The epicenter was ahead. I stood at the riverbank. The trench behind me. The village to the west, a collection of empty buildings and a southern slope where fifty-four people and one twelve-year-old boy were safe.

Hopefully safe enough.

I waited. The air was still. The ground hummed. The sky was wrong — too bright, too saturated, as though the light itself was overloaded.

The countdown was nearly done.

I could feel it in my bones. The singing. The old frequency, the one that had been part of me since my first memories and would be part of me after the last. The bones knew what was coming. They always knew.

I stood still. My hands were at my sides. My feet were on the glazed earth. My breathing was even.

Like standing on a hilltop, watching.

But this time, I was not watching from the hilltop. I was standing here — in the valley. In the path. In the direct trajectory of something that was about to happen.

For the first time in a long time, I was not observing.

I was here.
