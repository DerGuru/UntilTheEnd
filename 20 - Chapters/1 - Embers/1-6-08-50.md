The river was where I'd calculated it would be.

Not an accomplishment — rivers are predictable. The drought had reduced it to a third of its normal volume, the water running shallow and brown and warm, the banks exposed and cracked, the stones that were usually submerged sitting dry in the air like teeth in a receding gumline. But the channel was intact. The depth was sufficient. And the qi-flow — the redirected stream I'd engineered weeks ago — was still running through the channel like blood through a vein, carrying energy south, away from the village, dumping it into the plain beyond.

The tribulation's epicenter was upstream. Northwest. I could feel it — not see it, not from this position, but feel it with the kind of granularity that made seeing unnecessary. Xu Ran's qi-spiral was tightening. The consolidation was entering its final phase: the energy he'd accumulated over weeks of hunting and cycling was compressing into a structure that his dantian would either contain or rupture, and the difference between those outcomes was what separated a cultivator's ascension from a cultivator's death.

He was good. I'd give him that. The spiral was clean — well-structured, precisely layered, each ring of compressed qi sitting neatly inside the next. He had discipline. He had talent. He had the kind of intelligence that cultivation rewards: the ability to abstain from the temptation of shortcuts and do the difficult thing correctly, layer by layer, breath by breath.

He was also going to destroy this valley.

Not deliberately. The thought occurred to me again — the persistent, irritating distinction between intent and consequence that had been the defining frustration of my existence. Xu Ran was not malicious. He was not negligent. He was, by the standards of cultivation, responsible — his chosen location was remote, his preparations were methodical, his control was exceptional for his age and tier.

It just didn't matter. Core Formation breakthrough releases energy on a scale that renders individual responsibility meaningless. A tsunami isn't responsible for the coast it erases. A volcano isn't negligent toward the city on its slope. The physics are the physics. Xu Ran would break through, and the energy would expand, and the valley would absorb what it could and collapse under what it couldn't, and the sequence was as inexorable as gravity.

Unless.

The riverbed. This point, where the redirected qi-flow crossed the natural water channel. Water absorbs qi-energy — a basic physical property, as fundamental as water's capacity to absorb heat. There was enough volume here to catch most of the shockwave's edge, if — and only if — the channel was widened by two meters and the natural qi-pathway was fully exposed.

I started digging.

The riverbed was clay beneath the surface stones — dense, red-brown, packed by centuries of sedimentation. Digging it by hand was the kind of work that belonged in a punishment myth: the eternal task, the stone that rolls back, the water that refills the hole. My hands were already ruined from the previous weeks. The clay didn't care. It resisted the way clay resists everything — passively, stupidly, with the dense indifference of material that has no opinion about the creature trying to reshape it.

I dug. Two meters wider.

The trench needed to run from the qi-channel intersection to the deeper pool downstream, where the natural basin would catch what the water took and disperse it into a volume too large to notice. A long cut. By hand.

The math of the labor was less interesting than the math of the qi, but more urgent. Sunset was in hours. The tribulation's final phase would begin at dawn — maybe earlier, depending on Xu Ran's readiness. I had one night.

I dug.

The stones I removed from the channel were useful. I stacked them along the trench's edges, creating a low wall that would direct the water into the widened section rather than allowing it to spread. Each stone was placed with the same precision I'd used for the barrier walls.

By the time the sun was at the horizon, the trench was half-complete. Exposed clay, shaped and channeled and reinforced. The river water was already seeping into the new space, testing it, filling the lowest points and pooling in the depressions I'd carved. By morning, the widened channel would be fully wet — the volume increased, the absorption capacity proportionally enhanced.

I sat on the bank. For thirty seconds. The luxury of stillness.

The qi-column to the northwest was brighter now — visible even to normal eyes, if anyone had been looking. A faint shimmer above the treeline, like a pillar of hot air that extended higher than hot air should. The pressure had increased. I could feel it in my sinuses, in the base of my skull, in the joints of my fingers where the swelling from the digging met the swelling from the qi-pressure and produced a combined discomfort that was, in its specificity, almost interesting.

Wei was south. With the village. Safe — or as safe as distance could make them. He would be organizing, directing, keeping people calm. His hands would be shaking. His face would be thin. He would be doing everything I'd taught him and everything I hadn't, and he would be wondering where I was and why I'd gone east instead of south.

I thought about his mother. Her cracked hands. The five words.

Then I stood up and went back to digging.

The second half of the trench went faster — the clay was softer near the downstream pool, the water table closer to the surface, the stones fewer and smaller. I worked by moonlight and by the faint, wrong glow of the qi-column, and the rhythm of the digging became a kind of meditation: reach, pull, place, repeat. The body's oldest program, older than cultivation, older than language, older than the concept of a tool.

Hands in earth. Moving the world. One fistful at a time.

By midnight, it was done.

The trench ran from the qi-channel intersection to the downstream pool. The walls were reinforced. The water was flowing — shallow but steady — through the widened channel. Tomorrow, when the shockwave came, the river would catch it. Absorb it. Disperse the energy into the water table, into the plain, into a volume of earth and water too large to be damaged by the contained fraction of a Core Formation breakthrough.

The village would survive. The well would stay ruined. The stores would not last the winter. But the houses would stand and the people would live and the winter would be hard but not lethal.

Probably. The margin was thin. Thinner than I liked. But it was the widest margin I could produce without — the other thing.

I sat on the bank. My hands were bleeding. The blisters had broken hours ago and the clay had gotten into the raw tissue and the infection would start by morning.

Later.

The night was quiet. The qi-column pulsed. The river murmured.

I looked at the trench. At the stones. At the clay I'd reshaped with hands that could have reshaped the continent.

It would be enough. It had to be enough. Because if it wasn't—

I closed my eyes. Listened to the water. Let the river carry the thought downstream.

If it wasn't enough, I would know by morning.
