The river was where I'd thought it would.

Not an accomplishment — rivers are predictable. The drought had reduced it to a third of its normal volume, the water running shallow, brown and warm, the banks exposed and cracked, the stones that were usually submerged sitting dry in the air like teeth in a receding gumline. But the channel was intact. The depth was sufficient. And the qi-flow — the redirected stream I'd engineered earlier — was still running through the channel like blood through a vein, carrying energy south, away from the village, dumping it into the plain beyond.

The tribulation's epicenter was upstream. Northwest. I could feel it — not see it, not from this position, but feel it with the kind of granularity that made seeing unnecessary. Xu Ran's qi-spiral was tightening. The consolidation was entering its final phase: the energy he'd accumulated over weeks of hunting and cycling was compressing into a structure that his dantian would either contain or rupture, and the difference between those outcomes was what separated a cultivator's ascension from a cultivator's death.

He was good. I'd give him that. The spiral was clean — well-structured, precisely layered, each ring of compressed qi sitting neatly inside the next. He had discipline. He had talent. He had the kind of intelligence that cultivation rewards: the ability to abstain from the temptation of shortcuts and do the difficult thing correctly, layer by layer, breath by breath. He'd stumbled once — a single layer that slipped, destabilized, cost him days. But only once.

He was also going to destroy this valley.

Not deliberately. The thought occurred to me again — the persistent, irritating distinction between intent and consequence that had been the defining frustration of my existence. Xu Ran seemed neither malicious nor negligent. He was, by the standards of cultivation, responsible — his chosen location was remote, his preparations were methodical, his control was exceptional for his age and tier.

It just didn't matter. A Nascent Soul breakthrough releases energy on a scale that renders individual responsibility meaningless. A tsunami isn't responsible for the coast it erases. A volcano isn't negligent toward the city on its slope. The physics are just physics. Xu Ran would break through, and the energy would expand, and the valley would absorb what it could and collapse under what it couldn't, and the sequence was as inexorable as gravity.

Unless.

The riverbed. This point, where the redirected qi-flow crossed the natural water channel. Water absorbs qi-energy — a basic physical property, as fundamental as water's capacity to absorb heat. There was enough volume here to catch most of the shockwave's edge, if — and only if — the channel was widened by two meters and the natural qi-pathway was fully exposed.

I started digging — again.

The riverbed was clay beneath the surface stones — dense, red-brown, packed by centuries of sedimentation. Digging it by hand was the kind of work that belonged in a punishment myth: the eternal task, the stone that rolls back, the water that refills the hole. My hands were already ruined from the previous weeks. The clay didn't care. It resisted the way clay resists everything — passively, stupidly, with the dense indifference of material that has no opinion about the creature trying to reshape it.

I dug. Two meters wider.

The trench needed to run from the qi-channel intersection to the deeper pool downstream, where the natural basin would catch what the water took and disperse it into a volume too large to notice. A long cut. By hand.

The math of the labor was less interesting than the math of the qi, but more urgent. The afternoon was already fading. The tribulation's final phase would begin at dawn — maybe earlier, depending on Xu Ran's readiness. I had one night.

I dug.

The stones I removed from the channel were useful. I stacked them along the trench's edges, creating a low wall that would direct the water into the widened section rather than allowing it to spread. Each stone was placed with the same precision I'd used for the barrier walls.

By the time the sun was nearing the horizon, the trench was a quarter-complete. Exposed clay, shaped and channeled and reinforced. The river water was already seeping into the new space, testing it, filling the lowest points and pooling in the depressions I'd carved. By morning, the widened channel needed be fully wet — the volume increased, the absorption capacity proportionally enhanced.

I sat on the bank. For thirty seconds. The luxury of stillness.

The math arrived uninvited.

A quarter. And the light was almost gone. The clay downstream would be softer — wetter, closer to the water table — but the distance was longer. By hand, at the rate I'd been moving, the work would take until midday tomorrow. The tribulation wouldn't wait until midday tomorrow.

The qi-column to the northwest was brighter now, if anyone had been looking. A faint shimmer above the treeline, like a pillar of hot air that extended higher than hot air should. The pressure had increased. I could feel it in my sinuses, in the base of my skull, in the joints of my fingers where the swelling from the digging met the swelling from the qi-pressure and produced a combined discomfort that was, in its specificity, almost interesting.

I looked at my hands. Clay under the nails. Blood in the creases. Blisters that had broken and reformed and broken again. Honest hands. Human hands. Hands that had kept a village alive without becoming something else.

The math didn't care about honesty.

I checked. Carefully, the way you check a room before saying something you can't unsay. Xu Ran's spiral was turned inward — deep consolidation, his awareness compressed to the diameter of his own dantian. He wasn't sensing outward. He couldn't afford to. The village was south, behind the ridge, out of sight and out of range. Wei was there. Everyone was there.

No one was watching.

I put my hands back in the clay. Closed my eyes. And let go of something I'd been holding for a very long time.

Just a thread. Barely anything. A trickle of qi running through my palms and into the riverbed — just enough to soften the clay ahead of my fingers. To loosen the stones before I reached them. To let the earth move the way earth moves when you ask it instead of forcing it.

The clay parted.

I kept my eyes closed. If I didn't look at it, it was just digging. Faster digging. The kind of efficiency that practice produces, that muscle memory explains, that doesn't require any word more dangerous than *experience*.

Something shifted in my knuckles. A loosening — the calluses separating from the skin beneath, the hardened layers that weeks of manual labor had built — peeling away like bark from wet wood. The blisters went with them. I felt them go: each one a small, specific loss, the dead skin sloughing into the clay and the clay accepting it without comment.

I didn't stop. The trench extended. Downstream. The stones stacked themselves along the edges — no. I stacked them. My hands stacked them. The qi just made them lighter. That was all.

I opened my eyes.

The work was done. The moonlight lay across fresh-cut clay, wet and dark, the channel clean and even in a way that hands alone won't produce. The water was already flowing — finding the new space, filling it, the current adjusting without complaint to the wider path.

It had taken two hours, after six hours of digging.

I pulled the qi back. Closed it off. The thread went quiet.

I looked at my hands.

Smooth. Clean. The clay had been wiped away by the qi as if it had never been there. The blisters were gone — not broken, not healed over, simply absent. The calluses I'd built over weeks of stone-carrying and trench-digging and fence-building, the ones that had split and reformed and split again, the ones that had proved something I needed proved — gone. Fresh skin. Pink. Unmarked. The hands of someone who had never dug anything.

The trench ran from the qi-channel intersection to the downstream pool. The walls were reinforced. The water was flowing — shallow but steady — through the widened channel. Tomorrow, when the shockwave came, the river would catch it. Absorb it. Disperse the energy into the water table, into the plain, into a volume of earth and water too large to be damaged by the contained fraction of a Nascent Soul breakthrough.

The village would survive. The well would stay ruined. The stores would not last the winter. But the houses would stand and the people would live and the winter would be hard but not lethal.

I sat on the bank. My hands were in my lap. I turned them over. Palms up. The moonlight caught the new skin — smooth, pale, the unblemished surface of a body that had decided, without consultation, to undo the only evidence I had that I'd been human.

The blisters had cost me something. Now their absence cost me more.

The night was quiet. The qi-column pulsed. The river murmured.

I looked at the trench. At the stones. At the clean, even cut of a channel that no pair of human hands could have carved in a single night. At the hands that matched it — too smooth, too whole, as dishonest as the speed that had produced them.

It was enough. It had to be enough.

I closed my eyes. Listened to the water. Let the river carry downstream what the river could carry.

The rest I'd have to keep.
