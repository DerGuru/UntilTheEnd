Twenty-two people.

I hadn't looked up during the stabilization. Fifteen minutes with my hands on his chest and my eyes closed and my awareness narrowed to the microscopic architecture of a twelve-year-old boy's qi-channels — I hadn't registered the audience. The peripheral presence, yes — bodies, breathing, the ambient qi-signatures of unawakened humans in various states of fear and confusion. But not their faces. Not their attention.

I looked up now.

They were staring. Every one of them. The particular stare that humans produce when they've witnessed something that exceeds their framework and their framework hasn't had time to collapse and rebuild around the new data. Not fear — not yet. Not understanding — not possible. Something between the two: the suspended state of witnesses who have seen something they cannot categorize and are waiting, unconsciously, for the category to arrive.

Elder Li was closest. Three meters to my left. His hand was still extended from where he'd been holding Wei's head — frozen mid-gesture, the arm suspended in a position that must have been uncomfortable and that he appeared not to notice. His face was — open. The careful, constructed face that he wore for the village — the Elder's face, the face of authority and certainty and the kind of calm that leaders manufacture from inadequate materials — was gone. What remained was the face underneath: old, tired, bewildered, entirely honest.

He was looking at me the way you look at a landscape that has suddenly revealed a mountain you hadn't seen before. Not questioning whether the mountain was real — questioning how you'd failed to see something that large for that long.

He didn't understand what I was. He understood that I was more. That was enough. That was more than enough. That was the kind of understanding that doesn't require explanation because explanation would only diminish what comprehension had already achieved through instinct.

Mrs. Liu stood behind him. Her arms were crossed — the defensive posture she'd maintained through every crisis, the physical projection of a woman who met the world with her guard up. But her arms were loose. The tension was gone. She was holding herself the way people hold themselves in the presence of something that renders their defenses irrelevant — not threatened, but recalibrated.

Chen. Gao. Mrs. Zhao, her dislocated shoulder held against her body by the sling Wei had fashioned from a torn shirt. She was flexing her fingers. Testing the arm. Moving it in small, tentative circles that shouldn't have been possible with a joint displaced less than two days ago — though each rotation ended with a wince, the arc cut short by whatever damage remained. The ambient qi — the residual energy from the stabilization, the small amount that had leaked outward during the process — had touched her. Not enough to heal. Enough to begin.

She noticed. Looked at her shoulder. Looked at me. Said nothing.

The children were quiet. All of them. The particular quiet of children who are absorbing the emotional state of the adults around them by osmosis and adjusting their behavior to match a mood they can feel but not name. Xiao Mei held a stone in her hand — one of her game stones — and gripped it without playing, the way children hold objects when they need an anchor.

I looked at each of them. Briefly, systematically, the way I always did. They needed to be seen by me as I had been seen by them. The exchange was necessary.

Then I looked at Wei's mother.

She was standing three steps away. Precisely three — I'd noticed without trying. Three steps. Not two, which would have been intrusion. Not four, which would have been distance. Three. The exact distance of a woman who wanted to be close enough to reach her son and far enough to not interfere with the person saving him.

She was upright. Rigidly, deliberately upright, her spine straight, her chin level, her shoulders set in a line that was maintained by will rather than strength. She was not crying. Her eyes were wet — the physiology of emotion producing its involuntary evidence — but the tears weren't falling. They were held. Contained. The discipline of a woman who had decided that the cost of breaking down was higher than the cost of holding together and was paying the higher cost without complaint.

Her lips moved. A word. One word. Formed but not voiced, the shape visible on her mouth but the sound either too quiet to hear or too private to release into shared air. I understood anyway.

She held my gaze. I held hers. The exchange lasted three seconds. Five. Long enough for whatever needed to pass between us to complete its passage.

Then I looked down. At Wei.

He was sleeping. Genuinely sleeping — the deep, reconstructive sleep that follows trauma and precedes recovery, the body's most powerful healing tool deployed at its full capacity. His breathing was steady. The third-step pattern, restored, holding, each inhale and exhale measured in the count I'd built into his nervous system through weeks of repetition.

The glow under his skin was fading. Still present — visible in the thin skin at his temples, his wrists, the backs of his hands — but dimmer. The charge was dissipating. The channels were stabilizing. The body was doing what bodies do when given sufficient crisis and sufficient rest: adapting. Rebuilding. Becoming something it hadn't been before.

I pulled my hands back. Set them in my lap. Looked at the boy.

The village looked at me.

I had nothing to say to them. No explanation that would serve. No revelation that would help. No carefully constructed cover story about qi-resonance or herbal remedies or any of the comfortable fictions that might have bridged the gap between what they'd seen and what they could accept.

So I said nothing. I sat beside the boy and I looked at his face and I waited for his breathing to deepen and his features to soften and the twelve-year-old to return from wherever the older version had gone.

The village watched.

Eventually, one by one, they looked away. Not from discomfort — from the recognition that looking was no longer appropriate, that whatever they had witnessed had concluded, that the woman on the ground with her hands in her lap and the boy sleeping beside her had entered a space that audience participation would diminish.

Mrs. Liu was first. She turned, picked up a bundle, began organizing the return to the village. Elder Li followed. Then Chen — though not before Gao caught his arm and murmured something I wasn't meant to hear. I heard it anyway. *More than herbs.* Then the others, one by one, returning to the machinery of survival — the bundles and the water and the path home and the small, persistent, irreplaceable work of continuing to exist.

Wei's mother stayed. Three steps away. Standing. Watching her son breathe.

We stayed until the sun moved and the shadows shifted and the breathing held.
