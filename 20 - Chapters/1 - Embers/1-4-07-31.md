The crickets came back.

Not all of them — a delegation. Advance scouts, testing the night air with the cautious optimism of creatures that had evolved specifically to fill silence and took the recent absence of silence-to-fill as a personal affront. They started up one at a time, scattered across the clearing, each one waiting for confirmation from the others before committing fully. By the time the fire was burning steadily, five or six had reached consensus: the world was still here. Sound could resume.

Wei sat by the fire. Cross-legged. Hands on his knees. Eyes closed.

His breathing was steady — third step rhythm, the count I'd drilled into him until the pattern bypassed conscious thought and settled into the machinery of habit. Inhale. One, two, three. Exhale. One, two, three. The intervals were even, metronomic, the breathing of a boy who had learned to measure himself against a standard he couldn't see and trusted that the standard was real.

I sat beside him. Not across — beside. The distinction had crept up on me without announcement, the way most things about this arrangement had: a gradual rearrangement of proximity, each adjustment too small to notice individually and too significant to ignore in aggregate. A month ago, I'd sat across the fire from him. Two weeks ago, at a ninety-degree angle. Tonight: beside. A meter of space between us, occupied by warmth and firelight and the brand of quiet that exists between two people who have stopped needing to fill it.

The fire was good. He'd built it well — small, efficient, the ring of stones tight enough to contain the heat. He had stopped building large fires after I'd remarked, once, that large fires attracted attention and small fires attracted warmth. He hadn't asked which kind of attention. He was learning not to ask things he already knew the answers to.

The valley lay below us. From this rise — the same one where I'd first watched Xu Ran's vortex — the village was a collection of warm points in the dark, each one a window or a doorway or a cooking fire, each one a small human argument against the night's indifference. I could hear them from here: the murmur of final conversations, the splash of washing, a mother singing — badly, beautifully — to a child who wasn't tired.

Somewhere below, a dog barked once. Then stopped, as if it had heard something the rest of the village couldn't.

The lights on the horizon were absent tonight. Paused. Xu Ran was cycling inward, consolidating, preparing for the next expansion. Even from this distance, I could feel the dense knot of qi where he worked, coiled tight, patient in the way that avalanches are patient.

Three weeks.

Wei breathed. In. Out. The rhythm was hypnotic — a pulse that followed its own logic, independent of the crickets, independent of the fire, independent of everything except the body that produced it and the discipline that shaped it.

I listened.

That was all. I listened to the boy breathe. To the fire digest its wood. To the crickets negotiate their territory. To the village murmur and the valley hum and the distant, compressed heartbeat of a threat I could end with a thought and chose not to.

I just — was. Here. On this rise, by this fire, beside this boy.

It was enough.

That was the last quiet evening.

I didn't know that then. I'm telling you now because you deserve the warning I didn't get.

Wei's breathing slowed. The intervals stretched. His head dipped — caught himself — dipped again. The gradual, losing battle of a body that had been running all day and couldn't outpace its own exhaustion. His shoulders relaxed. His hands slid from his knees to the ground beside him. His chin touched his chest.

He was asleep. Upright, unfinished, mid-breath.

The fire was burning low. The coals glowed orange in the dark — warm, but diminishing. In an hour, they would be grey. In two, the cold would arrive with the certainty of something that had been waiting just outside the light's perimeter.

I reached over.

Not to him. To the fire. I took a piece of wood from the pile he'd gathered — a thick piece, dry, the kind that would burn slowly and evenly for hours — and set it on the coals. The fire caught it immediately, the orange brightening to yellow, the heat expanding outward in a wave that reached Wei and settled over him like a hand.

The fire would burn until morning now. He would be warm.

I stayed.

The crickets sang. The fire burned. The boy breathed.

I stayed.
