I arrived at the camp to find it breaking apart.

Not collapsing — organizing. The fire pits were being covered. Blankets rolled, packs shouldered, children gathered. The camp wasn't being evacuated — it was being *concluded.* They were getting ready to go home.

Wei was at the front, counting heads, checking the line. He'd made the call before I arrived — before the shockwave, I realized. Before the tremor, before the pressure wave, before the single tile that fell from a building none of them were inside. He'd felt it coming. The qi-sensitivity I'd built into his training — the third-step pattern, the foot-reading, the awareness of ambient pressure — had alerted him the way a barometer alerts a sailor. He'd felt the change, identified the direction, estimated the timeline, and made the call.

"Pack up. We're going home."

He'd said it with the authority of someone who'd already done the calculation and reached the conclusion and wasn't interested in discussing alternatives. Elder Li had looked at him — the old man's face doing the recalculation it had been doing since the village square — and nodded. Chen stood up. Gao stood up. Mrs. Liu folded blankets. The machinery of the community engaged, and the boy at its center wasn't pushing it or pulling it — he was simply facing the right direction and walking.

I fell in at the back of the line.

A child glanced over his shoulder, saw me, and looked away. Mrs. Liu's gaze flicked once — to my hands, to my face — and moved on. Elder Li did not turn fully. He didn't need to. The angle of his head changed by a degree, acknowledgment without ceremony.

No one said anything. 

The village was damaged. The distinction I'd been maintaining since the barriers went up — the distinction between repair and restoration, between surviving and living — still held. Two more tiles had fallen. The fence — rebuilt twice, reinforced once, source of ongoing philosophical debate about the structural integrity of recycled lumber — was down again. A window in Elder Li's house had cracked. Dust everywhere. The ever-present, drought-amplified dust that converted every event into a cloud and every cloud into a coating.

But the walls stood. The houses stood. The grain shed held. The water containers were intact, and the stream — fed by the spring that Wei had found and the channel I'd widened — was running clearer than it had in weeks.

Clearer.

I paused. Tested the water. The qi-contamination had dropped. Sharply. Xu Ran's consolidation had shifted — the siphon effect that had been draining the valley's qi for weeks was easing. The final compression had pulled his energy inward, away from the valley, concentrating it into the tight spiral that preceded breakthrough. The drain had slowed to a trickle.

The well would recover. The mineral contamination would take weeks to flush. Maybe longer, depending on what the shock had stirred up.

But it would recover. The fields would rehydrate. The trees on the eastern ridge would grow new leaves. The ecosystem would heal, the way ecosystems do when the parasite departs and the host remembers how to function.

I watched the village recognize this. Not all at once — recognition in a community is a slow, distributed process that moves through the population like weather. Mrs. Liu tasted the stream water first. Her face changed — not dramatically, but an easing of the tension around her eyes that had been there for so long it had become architectural. She said nothing. She didn't need to. Chen tasted it next. Then Elder Li. Then the children, who didn't understand water quality but understood that the adults had relaxed, and the relaxation of adults is the most reliable signal of safety that children know.

Wei stood in the village center. The same spot where he'd stood before. He looked around. At the fallen tiles and the broken fence and the dust and the cracked window. At the standing walls and the intact roof and the grain shed and the stream.

He nodded.

Not at anyone. Not for approval. The nod of someone who'd done the best he could with what he had and was cataloging the results without judgment — noting what held, what fell, what needed repair, what could wait. The nod of a future leader who'd finished his first campaign and was older for it.

I stood at the edge of the village. My usual position. The periphery, the margin, the space between belonging and observing. My hands were in my pockets — a gesture I hadn't made in centuries, the kind of unconscious self-containment that bodies perform when they don't know what else to do with themselves.

"He's learned it," I said quietly.

The words hung in the air. Simple. True. Insufficient.

He'd learned it.

Good.

A pause.

He'd need it.
