Dawn had already settled, when the ground moved.

A tremor. Two seconds, maybe three. A vibration that traveled up through the rock and the soil and the roots and arrived at the surface as a polite suggestion that the world was not, in fact, as solid as everyone assumed.

Wei was mid-step. Third count, right foot transitioning to left, his qi settling into the pattern I'd been hammering into him for weeks. He stopped. The cup on the flat stone beside us rattled against its surface — a tiny, ceramic protest. Somewhere in the village, a child cried out. Then silence.

Wei looked at me.

I hadn't moved.

"Earthquake?"

"Qi-shift."

He stood very still for a moment, processing. Then he went back to his stance. Right foot forward. Inhale. Count. I didn't tell him to continue — he simply did. He was learning to assess, prioritize, and act in the correct order. The tremor was over. The training wasn't.

Good.

By noon, the well was wrong.

Mrs. Liu noticed first — she noticed everything first, a consequence of being the kind of woman who woke before dawn and treated the village's infrastructure as a personal responsibility. She hauled up the bucket, looked inside, and set it down without drinking.

I was passing the well when she turned to the Elder. "The water's off."

That was an understatement. The bucket was full of something that was technically water in the way that mud is technically earth — yellowish, cloudy, with a metallic sheen that caught the light wrong. I didn't need to taste it to know. The qi-saturation in the groundwater had crossed a threshold. Minerals that had been stable for decades were dissolving, leaching into the aquifer, turning clean water into something that would cramp your stomach and dry your mouth.

Elder Li leaned over the bucket. He'd been chewing the inside of his cheek all morning — a habit he retreated to when worry outpaced his vocabulary.

"Hasn't been like this since my grandfather's time."

His grandfather's time. Sixty years, give or take. Which meant the last qi disturbance in this region had been minor enough to resolve itself. A traveling cultivator, probably. Someone passing through, their breakthrough ripple touching the valley and moving on.

This wasn't passing through.

I walked the perimeter that afternoon. The herbs I'd been monitoring — the ones Wei collected, the ones I directed him toward — were worse. Not just wilted now. Drained. Some had turned grey at the edges, their cellular structure collapsing as the ambient qi pulled moisture and vitality out of anything that wasn't strong enough to resist.

The trees on the eastern ridge were dead. Not winter-dormant — dead. Bark splitting, wood bleached grey, branches snapping under their own weight in the still air. Trees that had weathered decades of frost were crumbling as though the cold had found something inside them that was no longer there to resist it.

I counted. Mapped. Calculated.

The qi-drainage radius had expanded by a third since last week. Xu Ran was cycling faster — pulling energy from the environment to fuel his consolidation, compressing it, preparing. The physics of it were simple: a cultivator approaching breakthrough was a siphon. Everything within range fed the process. Water. Soil. Plants. Air. If the cultivator was weak, the effect was negligible — a few wilted flowers, a strange taste in the well for a season. If the cultivator was strong—

Xu Ran was strong.

Core Formation. Not the highest tier — not the kind that reshapes continents or splits mountains. But for a village without cultivation, without wards, without a single person above the first step of cultivation: enough. Enough to poison the well permanently. Enough to kill the harvest. Enough to turn a livable valley into a place where survival became a calculation rather than an assumption.

"Two weeks," I said to no one. "Maybe less."

Wei was behind me. I'd sensed him approaching — his qi-signature was getting more distinct as his training progressed, less like background noise and more like a specific frequency I could track without trying.

"Two weeks until what?"

"Until the water gets worse."

He looked at the dead trees on the ridge. At the grey herbs. At the cracks forming in the frozen earth between the roots — hairline fractures, barely visible, but there. The valley was dying from the inside out.

"And the earthquake this morning?"

"Same cause."

"The man in the forest."

It wasn't a question. He'd put it together — the direction of the qi-pressure, the timing, the correlation between the disturbances and the figure he'd never been close enough to see clearly. He was twelve, not stupid.

"What do we do?"

I looked at the village below. Twenty-three buildings. Smoke from cooking fires. Mrs. Liu hauling water from the stream now, since the well was unusable. Gao mending nets he'd barely used this week because the fish were gone too — fled downstream, following the clean water.

"You go help Mrs. Liu carry water."

"That's not what I meant."

"I know."

I didn't answer the question he was actually asking. The answer was still forming — assembling itself from pieces I'd been collecting for weeks, arranging into a shape I recognized from a hundred other valleys, a hundred other villages, a hundred other slow collapses I'd watched from hilltops and walked away from.

Except.

The boy. The tea. The congee.

It may not have been a decision. It may not have been a conscious choice. It may not have been anything at all. But I stayed.

"Help Mrs. Liu," I said again. "The stream water needs to be filtered. Three layers — sand, gravel, charcoal. I'll show you tonight."

He went. He didn't argue. He'd learned that when I repeated an instruction, the conversation was over.

I stayed on the ridge. The horizon pulsed — faint, rhythmic, patient. Like a heartbeat growing louder.

Two weeks.

The valley had survived worse. Probably. Statistically. But statistics are cold comfort when the well turns yellow and the trees die and the ground beneath your feet reminds you, gently, that it doesn't owe you its stability.

I started walking. Not away — around. Mapping the qi-flows, the fault lines, the pressure points. Knowledge first. Then action.

The congee had been terrible. But I could still taste it. You'll understand why that mattered, later.
