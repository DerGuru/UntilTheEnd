4. **4-2-08-15.md (Ch. 15)** — 9 instances. The triggers chapter accumulates negations as it builds toward the breaking point.

## German Words Found

| File | Line (approx.) | Text | Note |
|------|----------------|------|------|
| **4-2-07-14.md** | ~L54 | "Because silence was **Vergessen**, forgetting." | German word for "forgetting" — italicized, used as concept-name |
| **4-2-10-17.md** | ~L29 | "not the **wanderschaft** of curiosity" | German: Wanderschaft (journeying). Lowercase, not italicized. |
| **4-3-01-18.md** | ~L35 | "This was not the **wanderschaft** of curiosity" | Same word repeated in next chapter. |
| **4-2-05-12.md** | ~L37 | "*Knack.*" | Onomatopoeia — used as sound effect. Borderline: exists in English as "knack" (skill) but the usage here mirrors German "Knack" (crack/snap sound). Likely intentional. |

## Recommendations

1. **Part 1 is significantly over-indexed.** The opening chapters establish the apophatic voice powerfully but risk training the reader to expect every insight delivered through negation. Consider converting 30–40% of LOW instances to direct statement.

2. **The HIGH-severity patterns are the book's rhetorical signature** — "Not a thought. Not a decision. Something below both." These should be *preserved* but made *rarer*. Currently they appear ~every 2 chapters. Reduce to every 3–4 chapters for maximum impact.

3. **The cascading-negation pattern** ("Caring required preference and preference required will and will was the disconnected cable") is the most distinctive and effective. It appears 8 times. Consider keeping 4–5 and converting the rest.

4. **"Which was not healing. Which was not hope."** (Ch. 17, end of Part 2) is the most powerful single instance — the apophatic culmination of the entire part's arc. Protect this at all costs. Reduce surrounding instances so this one lands harder.

5. **German words:** "Vergessen" works well as a deliberate philosophical term (italicized). "wanderschaft" should either be capitalized/italicized as a deliberate German loan (Wanderschaft) or replaced with English ("wandering," "journeying"). "Knack" is fine as onomatopoeia but verify intent.
