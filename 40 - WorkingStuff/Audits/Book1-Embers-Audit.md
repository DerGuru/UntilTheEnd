# Book 1 "Embers" — Continuity & Consistency Audit

## Executive Summary

Book 1 is **remarkably consistent** across its 66 chapters and 7 Parts. Hard numbers (village population, house count, trench length, Wei's age, cultivation stages) are used correctly throughout without contradiction. The timeline reconstructs cleanly to approximately three months, confirmed by an explicit reference in 1-7-08-62. POV discipline holds — no breaks from first-person retrospective narration detected. Motifs (hands, outer robe, third-step pattern) are tracked and evolved correctly.

**Five issues were found,** ranging from minor typos to a moderate continuity gap. None are structural or plot-breaking.

## 1. Timeline Reconstruction

| Part | Chapters | Duration | Season | Key Time Marker |
|------|----------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **1 — Hook** | 1–8 | ~1–2 days | Late autumn | "First frost is a month out" (1-1-05) |
| **2 — Plot Turn 1** | 9–16 | ~3–4 weeks | Autumn | "Three weeks" of herb sorting (1-2-03); collecting Whitestem for "two weeks" (1-2-05) |
| **3 — Pinch 1** | 17–24 | ~2 weeks | Late autumn | "Three weeks ago" since boar (1-3-02); "Winter still a month away" (1-3-07) |
| **4 — Midpoint** | 25–31 | ~2–3 weeks | Autumn→Winter | "A month ago, I'd sat across the fire" (1-4-07); "three weeks, perhaps four" until tribulation (1-4-06) |
| **5 — Pinch 2** | 32–42 | ~2–3 weeks | Early winter | "Two weeks" until tribulation (1-5-01); drought: "nine days without snow became twelve, became sixteen" (1-5-05) |
| **6 — Plot Turn 2** | 43–54 | ~1–2 weeks | Winter | "The well went dry" (1-6-01); "died a month ago" (1-6-05); "It was winter" (1-6-01) |
| **7 — Resolution** | 55–66 | ~1–2 days | Winter | "Three months of training" (1-7-08) — confirms total duration |

**Verdict: ✅ CONSISTENT.** All markers align to ~3 months (late autumn → winter).

## 2. Hard Numbers

| Fact | Value | Verdict |
|------|-------|---------|
| Village population | 54 | ✅ Consistent across 5 occurrences |
| Houses/structures | 23 | ✅ |
| Trench length | 120 meters | ✅ |
| Wei's age | 12 | ✅ |
| Blast radius | 7 li | ✅ |

---

## 3. Cultivation System — ✅ Consistent

- Xu Ran: Core Formation → Nascent Soul (tribulation in Part 7)
- Geographic progression: 6 li → 5 li → ~2 li from village
- Villagers evacuated to southern slope, 3 li from epicenter

---

## 4. POV — ✅ No Breaks

First-person retrospective maintained throughout all 66 chapters.

---

## 5. Motif Tracking — ✅ All Correct

- **Hands:** Bleeding → Healed (1-6-08) → Smooth (1-6-10, 1-7-06, 1-7-10). No anachronisms.
- **Outer Robe:** Given (1-3-08), callbacks (1-5-10, 1-6-12). Consistent.
- **Third-Step Pattern:** Consistent "1-2-3" throughout.

---

## 6. Character Names — ✅ No Issues

Elder Li, Mrs. Liu, Mrs. Zhao, Chen, Gao, Xiao Mei — all consistent.

## 7. Issues Found

### Issue 1 — ⚠️ TYPO: "smrlls" (1-7-08-62, line 5)
"That smrlls funny." → Should be "smells"

### Issue 2 — ⚠️ GRAMMAR: "didn't made" (1-6-05-47, line 3)
"didn't made it easier" → Should be "didn't make"

### Issue 3 — ⚠️ FORMATTING: Double space (1-7-12-66, line 31)
"energy  barely present" → single space

### Issue 4 — ⚠️ CONTINUITY: Wei's siblings vanish after Part 3
Older brother appears in 1-2-04 and 1-3-04. Sister appears in 1-3-04. Neither mentioned in Parts 4–7 during drought, evacuation, or tribulation. No explanation given.

### Issue 5 — 🔍 NARRATIVE CHOICE: Father's death off-screen
Terminal illness established Parts 1–2. Death mentioned retroactively in 1-6-05: "Wei's father had died a month ago." No scene, no grief beat at the time. May be intentional (Yun's voice) but worth conscious confirmation.
