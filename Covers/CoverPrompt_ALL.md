## BILD 0 — Serien-Cover

**Buchtitel:** Keiner (nur Serientitel "UNTIL THE END" und Autor).

**Szene:** A vast, vertical composition. A narrow mountain path cuts upward through layered fog, disappearing into a sky that is cracked — hairline fractures running through the atmosphere like stressed glass, barely visible, deeply wrong. Three figures on the path, dwarfed by the landscape: a boy (Wei, ~13) walking ahead with stubborn determination; a young man (Xu Ran) a step behind, one hand raised as if measuring something invisible; and behind them both, a woman (Yun) in a simple weathered robe, perfectly still while the world moves around her. The air near her warps subtly — heat-haze distortion without heat. At the path's edge: a single dying ember glowing orange against the cold blue-grey world. Far below, in the valley, distant torches suggest pursuit. Color palette: cold slate blues, fog whites, one warm ember-orange point. The cracks in the sky are the quietest and most important detail.

## BILD 1 — "Embers"

**Buchtitel:** "Embers"

**Szene:** A dark forest clearing at night. Center: a woman (Yun) crouches over a boy (Wei, ~12) who lies unconscious on the ground. Her hands press against his chest. Between her fingers, light — not fire, not magic, but something structural, architectural, as if she is rebuilding something inside him. The light is ember-orange, warm, pulsing with a heartbeat rhythm. Around them, the forest is REACTING: trees bend slightly outward from the pair as if pushed by an invisible shockwave frozen mid-expansion. Leaves hang motionless in mid-air. The moss on the ground is pressed flat in a perfect circle around them. In the deep background, through the trees: a village, doors closed, windows shuttered, a few faces barely visible — watching from the dark. Above: the canopy has a gap where the pressure has pushed branches apart, revealing a sky that looks too heavy, too close. Color palette: near-black forest, cold blue shadows, one intense ember-orange epicenter. The moment feels like holding your breath.

## BILD 2 — "Roots"

**Buchtitel:** "Roots"

**Szene:** A mountain ridge at dawn, shot from below looking up. Two figures stand on the ridge crest — silhouetted, small against an enormous sky. Wei (a teenage boy, ~13) is mid-step, walking forward. Yun (a woman in a simple robe) stands perfectly still behind him. Between them and the viewer: thirty li of blurred, streaked landscape — as if the space between was crossed in a single impossible step. The blur is not motion blur — it's reality compressed, terrain that exists but was skipped. At the very bottom of the image, far below in sharp focus: three cultivators in an empty forest clearing, kneeling before nothing. One holds up a jade tablet that glows cool green — the only cold-colored light in a warm dawn scene. The contrast between the kneeling figures (sharp, small, organized) and the two on the ridge (free, windswept, uncontainable) IS the cover. Color palette: warm gold dawn at top, cold blue-green jade accent at bottom.

## BILD 3 — "Silence"

**Buchtitel:** "Silence"

**Szene:** A small settlement, viewed from slightly above. One house, door ajar, warm light inside — but no people. The central image: a perfect circle of dead ground. Three meters diameter. Every blade of grass inside the circle is grey-brown, flat, dead. Every leaf has fallen simultaneously. Outside the circle: lush green, alive, normal. At the exact center of the dead circle stands Yun, half in profile, holding a small herb pot against her hip — not cradling it, carrying it, the way you carry something that will outlive its context. Her expression is calm. Not sad — past sad. Her feet are bare on the dead grass. The boundary between alive and dead ground is sharp, surgical, as if her presence is a blade that cuts life from the earth without touching it. One detail: a small bird sits on the roof of the house — but it's facing away, as if it cannot bring itself to look toward her. Stimmung: the horror is in the geometry. The circle is too perfect. Her calm is too complete.

## BILD 4 — "Echoes"

**Buchtitel:** "Echoes"

**Szene:** A forest path in rain. Yun walks forward, her back to the viewer, robes dark with water. Behind her, five steps back: Xu Ran (a young man) has stopped walking. His notebook is open. He's staring at the path ahead of Yun — because the path is WRONG. The trees on either side lean inward at angles that don't match gravity. The vanishing point of the trail has shifted left of where geometry says it should be. Puddles on the ground reflect a sky that is slightly different from the actual sky above — different cloud formations, different light angle. One stone cairn at the path's edge, moss-covered, ancient — but it casts a shadow in the wrong direction. Xu Ran's expression: not fear, but the focused intensity of someone who has just confirmed that what they suspected is real. The rain falls straight everywhere except near Yun — near her, the drops curve slightly, as if falling through a lens. Color palette: deep grey-greens, silver rain, one warm tone in Xu Ran's notebook pages.

## BILD 5 — "Fractures"

**Buchtitel:** "Fractures"

**Szene:** Perspective from the edge of absence. The viewer stands where a mountainside SHOULD be — and looks out into open air where solid rock should exist. The cut is clean. Geometrically perfect. A vertical cliff face, sliced as if by something that doesn't negotiate with stone. The exposed cross-section shows geological layers — millennia of sediment, now a wall facing nothing. At the top of this impossible edge: Yun, standing at the lip, looking down (toward the viewer). Her hair moves in wind. Her face is unreadable. Xu Ran (a man) stands three steps behind her, one hand reaching toward her shoulder but not touching — arrested mid-gesture, as if he thought better of it. Above them: thin clouds with hairline cracks running through them, the sky itself showing stress fractures, as if reality is a pane of glass and something has struck it from the other side. Below (where the viewer is): nothing. Empty air where a mountain used to be. No debris. No explanation. Color palette: stark morning whites, exposed stone ochres and greys, the cracked sky a cold blue with white fracture lines.

## BILD 6 — "Mirrors"

**Buchtitel:** "Mirrors"

**Szene:** A shallow river in fog, shot from the side. Yun kneels in ankle-deep water, hands submerged, head bowed. The water is impossibly still — mirror-flat, mercury-smooth. Her reflection is visible. Her reflection is WRONG. Real Yun looks down at her hands. Reflection-Yun looks directly outward — at the viewer. Same face, same robes, same posture from the neck down. But the reflection's eyes are open, focused, staring out of the water with an expression that knows something the real Yun is refusing to know. The divergence is small — just the eyes, just the angle of the head — but it is deeply, viscerally unsettling. On the riverbank, elevated: Xu Ran (a man) sits with his notebook, pen frozen mid-word. He has seen the reflection too. His face: the look of someone who has just understood something they cannot un-understand. The fog presses in close. The world beyond ten meters doesn't exist — just white. Color palette: silver water, muted greys, Yun's dark hair the strongest contrast. The reflection is slightly warmer in tone than the real figure — as if it exists in a different light.

## BILD 7 — "Clouds"

**Buchtitel:** "Clouds"

**Szene:** A cave mouth high in the mountains, framing a view of an enormous sky. Inside the cave: Yun, sitting on bare stone. She is older now — grey streaks in her dark hair, fine lines at her eyes, the kind of aging that shouldn't be possible for what she is. Her hands lie open on her knees, palms up, fingers relaxed — the hands of someone who has finally stopped holding on. Her expression: not peace exactly, but the absence of resistance. Acceptance as an act, not a feeling. Outside the cave: the sky is vast, filled with slow-moving clouds lit from below by a sun that is setting or rising — ambiguous. The clouds are the most alive thing in the image — textured, layered, luminous. But at the very edges of the cave mouth, where stone meets sky, the boundary softens. The rock is not quite solid. The sky is not quite empty. The transition between inside and outside is slightly too smooth, as if the cave and the sky are beginning to agree on something. No other people. No animals. No plants. Just stone, sky, clouds, and the woman between them. Color palette: warm amber light from outside flowing into cool blue-grey stone inside. The warmest point: her face, catching the last light.
