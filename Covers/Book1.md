Portrait book cover, 5:8, 1600×2560, premium KDP fantasy cover, for a xianxia / progression fantasy novel with painterly realism with restrained anime sensibility (Frieren-like restraint), cinematic lighting, atmospheric depth.

Hard layout guides:
- Top 30% is a calm, low-detail fog/gradient panel for typography (cool dark, no bright hotspots).
- Bottom 12% is a calm, darker low-detail panel for author name (no highlights behind text).
- Main subject and key details must not intersect the top/bottom panels; strong readable silhouette at thumbnail size.

Typography must be part of the image, consistent across the entire series:
1) Series title: "UNTIL THE END" centered, baseline at ~10% image height, classic Roman serif small caps (Trajan-like), generous tracking, off-white, subtle shadow/outline.
2) Book title: "Embers" centered, baseline at ~22% image height, large premium serif, embossed/foil-stamped gold leaf texture, warm ember-gold with subtle patina, very readable, minimal premium shadow/outline.
3) Author: "Andreas "TuedayPhysics" Jakof" centered, baseline at ~93% image height, same style as series title, off-white, subtle shadow/outline.

No subtitle, no series number, no badges, no logos. Keep typography placement identical on every book.

NEGATIVE PROMPT
logo, watermark, frame, low-res, blurry, noisy, overexposed, neon, cyberpunk, sci-fi, guns, modern clothing, sexualized pose, cleavage, bikini armor, chibi, cartoonish, excessive magic effects, lightning storm, gore, horror monster focus, crowded scene, multiple main characters.

Scene: 
an ancient, rain-dark forest at dusk, heavy moss, thick trunks, dense canopy. The atmosphere feels unnaturally silent and heavy (no birds, no wind), with dust motes suspended in a warm/cold contrast.
Main subject: a lone immortal woman (Yun), barefoot, wearing a simple weathered robe (no armor, no jewelry), long dark hair, calm tired eyes, expression detached but not cruel. She stands still with quiet, overwhelming presence (mountain-like).
In her open palm: a tiny ember-orange glow (subtle, not a fireball), softly lighting her fingers and a small patch of moss.
Midground: the forest opens toward a small poor village at the treeline, a few warm window lights—fragile, distant, human.
Magic/Qi: add very subtle qi-pressure distortion (gentle shimmering/warping in the air, like cold heat-haze), hinting at an approaching tribulation without showing lightning or big VFX.
Color palette: deep moss greens, muted browns, cold blue shadows; one strong ember-orange accent.
Composition: strong readable silhouette at thumbnail size; cinematic lighting; atmospheric depth; top 25–30% clean for title, bottom area calmer for author name placement; premium KDP fantasy cover quality; painterly realism with restrained anime sensibility (Frieren-like restraint), emotionally quiet, mature.
